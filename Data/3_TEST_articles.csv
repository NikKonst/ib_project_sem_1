7079734,The human genes for S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and adenosine deaminase are syntenic on chromosome 20,"Human-Chinese hamster cell hybrids and a monoclonal antibody to human S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase were used to identify chromosome 20 as the location of the human gene for this enzyme. The gene for adenosine deaminase had previously been mapped to this chromosome. The activity of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase is dependent in vivo on that of adenosine deaminase, since the substrates for the deaminase, adenosine and deoxyadenosine, respectively, inhibit and inactivate S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in genetic or drug-induced adenosine deaminase deficiency. This functional dependence and the likelihood that S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, a eukaryotic enzyme, arose later than adenosine deaminase, which occurs in prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes, suggest that the occurrence of their genes on the same chromosome may have evolutionary significance. In addition, the unusual capacity of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase to form stable complexes with adenosine and its cofactor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, suggest that evolution of its gene may have involved recombination of a portion of the adenosine deaminase gene with an adenine nucleotide domain-coding sequence of another preexisting gene.",1
28132113,A systematic analysis of controlled clinical trials using the NiTi CAR compression ring in colorectal anastomoses,"Anastomotic leak following colorectal surgery can be a devastating adverse event. The ideal stapling device should be capable of rapid creation of an anastomosis with serosal apposition without the persistence of a foreign body or a foreign body reaction which potentially contribute to early anastomotic dehiscence or late anastomotic stricture. A systematic review was performed examining available data on controlled randomized and non-randomized trials assessing the NiTi compression anastomosis ring-(NiTi CAR) (NiTi Solutions, Netanyah Israel) in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) standards. A protocol for this meta-analysis has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42016050934). The initial search yielded 45 potentially relevant articles. After screening titles and abstracts for relevance and assessment for eligibility, 39 of these articles were eventually excluded leaving 6 studies for analysis in the review. Regarding the primary outcome measure, the overall anastomotic leak rate was 2.2% (5/230) in the compression anastomosis group compared with 3% (10/335) in the conventional anastomosis group; this difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.25-2.24; participants = 565; studies = 6; I (2) = 0%). There were no statistically significant differences between compression and conventional anastomoses in any of the secondary outcomes. This review was unable to demonstrate any statistically significant differences in favor of the compression anastomosis technique over conventional manual or stapled mechanical anastomoses.",0
26392872,Assessment of impact of a novel infectious bursal disease (IBD) vaccination programme in breeders on IBD humoral antibody levels through the laying period,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess whether broiler breeders vaccinated in ovo with a Vaxxitek (HVT&IBD) (Merial) plus an inactivated IBD vaccine prior to the onset of lay had a significantly different humoral IBD antibody response to broiler breeders vaccinated solely with Vaxxitek (HVT&IBD) (Merial) in ovo. In addition, maternally derived antibody (MDA) passed to the progeny of these two breeders flocks was also compared at three time points during lay. DESIGN: The study was a case-control study where the two flocks were the same breed, reared on the same farm and transferred to the same laying farm, the only difference between the flocks being the IBD vaccination programme. The humoral IBD antibody response in the flocks and their progeny was measured using two commercial ELISA tests and a serum neutralisation (SN) test. RESULTS: There was no significant difference (P<0.05) in the humoral IBD antibody response in the two breeder flocks as measured by ELISA test except at a single time point at 22 weeks when measured by BioChek ELISA and at 60 weeks when measured by IDEXX ELISA. There was no significant difference (P<0.05) in the humoral IBD antibody response in the two breeder flocks as measured by SN test except at 27 and 55 weeks. There was no significant difference (P<0.05) in the levels of MDA passed to progeny of these two breeder flocks as measured by ELISA or SN test. CONCLUSIONS: It is proposed that a single vaccination with Vaxxitek (HVT&IBD) (Merial) will provide a similar level of IBD protection to breeders and their progeny as a Vaxxitek (HVT&IBD) (Merial) plus inactivated IBD vaccine, vaccination programme. This novel IBD vaccine provides additional options for vaccination programmes for broiler breeders without impacting on the protection of the broiler progeny.",0

2395880,Substitution of a single amino acid (aspartic acid for histidine) converts the functional activity of human complement C4B to C4A,"The C4B isotype of the fourth component of human complement (C4) displays 3- to 4-fold greater hemolytic activity than does its other isotype C4A. This correlates with differences in their covalent binding efficiencies to erythrocytes coated with antibody and complement C1. C4A binds to a greater extent when C1 is on IgG immune aggregates. The differences in covalent binding properties correlate only with amino acid changes between residues 1101 and 1106 (pro-C4 numbering)--namely, Pro-1101, Cys-1102, Leu-1105, and Asp-1106 in C4A and Leu-1101, Ser-1102, Ile-1105, and His-1106 in C4B, which are located in the C4d region of the alpha chain. To more precisely identify the residues that are important for the functional differences, C4A-C4B hybrid proteins were constructed by using recombinant DNA techniques. Comparison of these by hemolytic assay and binding to IgG aggregates showed that the single substitution of aspartic acid for histidine at position 1106 largely accounted for the change in functional activity and nature of the chemical bond formed (ester vs. amide). Surprisingly, substitution of a neutral residue, alanine, for histidine at position 1106 resulted in an increase in binding to immune aggregates without subsequent reduction in the hemolytic activity. This result strongly suggests that position 1106 is not ",1
30039344,"Kidney Function, Polypharmacy, and Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in a Community-Based Cohort of Older Adults","BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) afflicts many older adults and increases the risk for medication-related adverse events. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated morbidity and mortality of polypharmacy (use of several medications concurrently), and potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) use in older adults, looking for differences by CKD status. METHODS: We quantified medication and PIM use (from Beers criteria, the Screening Tool of Older People's Prescriptions, and Micromedex((R))) by level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for participants aged 65 years or older attending a baseline study visit in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (n =6392). We used zero-inflated negative binomial and Cox proportional hazards regressions to assess the relationship between baseline polypharmacy, PIM use, and subsequent hospitalization and death. RESULTS: Mean age at baseline was 76 (+/- 5) years, 59% were female, and 29% had CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Overall, participants reported 6.1 (+/- 3.5) medications and 2.3 (+/- 2.2) vitamins/supplements; 16% reported >/= 10 medications; 31% reported a PIM based on their age. On average, participants with CKD reported more medications. A PIM based on kidney function was used by 36% of those with eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Over a median of 2.6 years, more concurrent medications were associated with higher risk of hospitalization and death, but PIM use was not. While those with CKD had higher absolute risks, there was no difference in the relative risks associated with greater numbers of medications by CKD status. CONCLUSION: Polypharmacy and PIM use were common, with greater numbers of medications associated with higher risk of hospitalization and death; relative risks were similar for those with and without CKD.",0
8161965,Cytoskeletal control of the apical surface transformation of rat uterine epithelium,"During early pregnancy, in the lead up to blastocyst implantation, the apical cell surface of luminal epithelial cells of the rat uterus undergo a dramatic shape transformation. This study aims to investigate the role of the cytoskeleton in this apical transformation by considering the effects of the drugs cytochalasin D and colchicine on the uterine luminal cell surface. The results are determined using transmission and scanning electron microscopy. In vivo exposure to cytochalasin D during oestrus, as well as on day 1 of pregnancy, did not affect the long, regular surface microvilli. This drug, however, did disrupt the terminal web within the apical cytoplasm of these cells. Disruption of microfilament (MF) polymerization by cytochalasin D on day 4 of pregnancy induced a cell surface transformation, resulting in the appearance of numerous irregular projections normally present during blastocyst implantation on day 6 of pregnancy. Colchicine did not alter the uterine microvilli of oestrus or day 1 pregnant tissue. Unlike the effect of cytochalasin D, colchicine-induced microtubule (MT) disruption on day 4 of pregnancy did not increase irregular projections and hence this treatment did not result in the cell surface appearance associated with blastocyst implantation. These results indicate that the disruption of MF, rather than MT, contributes to the transformation of the uterine luminal cell surface during the lead up to blastocyst attachment.",0
14726805,"Mutations in genes required for T-cell development: IL7R, CD45, IL2RG, JAK3, RAG1, RAG2, ARTEMIS, and ADA and severe combined immunodeficiency: HuGE review","Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is an inherited immune disorder characterized by T-cell lymphopenia (TCLP), a profound lack of cellular (T-cell) and humoral (B-cell) immunity and, in some cases, decreased NK-cell number and function. Affected children develop severe bacterial and viral infections within the first 6 months of life and die before 1 year of age without treatment. Mutations in any of eight known genes: IL2RG, ARTEMIS, RAG1, RAG2, ADA, CD45, JAK3, and IL7R cause SCID. Mutations in unidentified genes may also cause SCID. Population-based genotype and allelic frequencies of these gene defects have not been measured. Some minimal estimates of SCID prevalence are presented. Currently, hematopoietic stem cell transplants are the standard treatment. In clinical trials, gene therapy has been used to reconstitute immune function in patients with IL2RG and ADA defects. The availability of effective therapies, plus the short asymptomatic period after birth, (when stem-cell transplantation is most effective), make SCID a potentially good candidate for newborn screening. Dried blood spots are currently collected from all infants at birth for newborn metabolic screening. Tests for TCLP on dried blood spots could be developed as a screen for SCID. Because SCID may be unrecognized, with infant deaths from infection attributed to other causes, newborn screening is the only way to ascertain true birth prevalence. Validated tests and pilot population studies are necessary to determine newborn screening's potential for identifying infants with SCID.",1
1090610,Adenylate energy charge in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during starvation,"Bakers' yeast cells, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, if grown aerobically on ethanol or if grown aerobically on glucose and allowed to pass into stationary phase, with utilization of accumulated ethanol, maintain a normal value (0.8 to 0.9) of the adenylate energy charge during prolonged starvation. In contrast, cells grown anaerobically on glucose and cells in the early stages of aerobic growth on glucose exhibit a rapid decrease of energy charge if transferred to medium lacking on energy source. These results suggest that functional mitochondria or enzymes of balance of adenine nucleotides during starvation. Yeast cells remain viable at energy charge values below 0.1, in marked contrast to results previously obtained with Escherichia coli. In other respects, the engery charge responses of yeast to starvation and refeeding are generally similar to those previously reported for E. coli.",0
11170752,The cluster of BTN genes in the extended major histocompatibility complex,"We sequenced the 170-kb cluster of BTN genes in the extended major histocompatibility complex region, 4 Mb telomeric of human leukocyte antigen class I genes, at 6p22.1. The cluster consists of seven genes belonging to the expanding B7/butyrophilin-like group, a subset of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. The main complex is composed of six genes, from two subfamilies, BTN2 and BTN3, arranged in pairs. This alternating pattern must have evolved by duplications of an original block of two genes, one from each subfamily. The sequences from the two subfamilies share approximately 50% amino acid identity. By analysis of repeat elements within each block, these duplications may be dated to approximately 100 million years ago, at about the time of the branching of the Rodentia and Primate lineages. The single BTN1A1 (butyrophilin) gene was positioned approximately 25 kb centromeric to the cluster. Each gene covers approximately 12 kb and consists of seven (BTN2 subfamily) or nine (BTN3 subfamily) coding exons. The predicted leader sequence, immunoglobulin-like IgV (variable)/IgC (constant) ectodomains, and the predicted transmembrane domain are encoded on separate exons and are separated from a B30.2 domain by a variable number of very short exons, 21 and 27 nucleotides in length. BTN transcripts were detected in all tissues examined. Alternative splicing, involving particularly the carboxyl-terminal B30.2 domain, was a notable feature. Most transcripts of BTN2 subfamily genes contained this domain, whereas BTN3 genes did not. Using immunofluorescence, we showed surface expression of BTN-green fluorescent protein fusions in mammalian cell transfectants.",1
513113,A binding site model of membrane transport: binary and cooperative flows,"The flows of solute molecules in a membrane under the influence of concentration gradients are considered within the framework of classical physical theories. A lattice model is constructed in which the binding sites represent potential minima and the flows are regarded as a result of molecules' making discrete transitions between the binding sites. Expressions for two-component currents are derived from certain descriptions for the transition mechanism. Where the molecular movement is given the crudest description, permeability coefficients are identical for both components and there is no current coupling. Where the molecular movement is given some finer detail, the permeability coefficients differ and positive coupling of flows appears. Our result applies to a combination of flows of tracer and abundant species as well as, more generally, to any combination of flows of two components which are distinguishable yet kinetically similar. Also considered are binary currents whose transport mechanism is further controlled by allosteric cooperativity. Whether the cooperative control is short or long ranged, permeability coefficients and fluxes differ appreciably from those without cooperative control. Thus, unlike in the case of channel flow, current coupling here may be either positive or negative, depending on the strength and nature of cooperative coupling. Numerical evidence suggests that the permeability and coupling may have discontinuous behavior, possibly indicating the existence of phase transitions. Our lattice model, from which the formulations for the flows are obtained, is compatible with current concepts of membrane structure.",0
10344311,Congenital bone malformations in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1),"To address the prevalence of congenital bone malformations in neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1; compared with Nf1 bone anomalies and tumors), we studied the Nf1 population of 135 children (70 boys, 65 girls) seen at the neurofibromatosis clinic, University of Catania, Italy, in the period 1990 through 1996. Twelve (8.8%) of the 135 children had congenital bone malformations: unilateral or bilateral postaxial polydactyly type A (n = 1) and type B (n = 1), bilateral postaxial polydactyly type A in association with preaxial polydactyly type 1 (n = 1) and bilateral preaxial polydactyly (n = 1); clynodactyly (n = 1); multiple segmentation anomalies of the vertebrae (n = 6), and complex costovertebral anomalies (n = 1). We found a higher frequency of polydactyly (2.9%) in comparison to that in the general population (0.014-0.12%) and in our national (0.027%) and regional (0.066%) population, and a higher frequency of vertebral (5.1%) and costovertebral (0.7%) malformations. This is the first study to state the overall prevalence of congenital bone malformations in an Nf1 population. Interestingly, polydactyly (postaxial type) and Nf1 was previously reported only once.",0
25506527,SERI Surgical Scaffold as an Adjunct for Circumferential Abdominoplasty and Lower Body Lift,"SUMMARY: Patients who have undergone massive weight loss typically have poor-quality skin and fascia and thus are prone to experiencing recurrent skin laxity, bulges, and poor scarring after body contouring efforts, even in the hands of experienced surgeons. Moreover, this challenging patient population often has nutritional deficiencies and concomitant medical problems, which may lead to delayed or suboptimal wound healing. A silk-derived biological scaffold (SBS) and its facilitation of autogenous tissue generation may be viewed as a qualitative reinforcement of the superficial fascial system. Therefore, it may help support and stabilize a superficial fascial system that has been weakened by obesity and other factors. When employed in body lifting for patients with massive weight loss who desire long-lasting aesthetic results, it may represent a paradigm shift that has the potential to solve at least some issues that plague this patient population. In the present case of circumferential abdominoplasty and lower body lift, this silk-based bioresorbable scaffold was implanted in one side of the patient's body but not the other. Throughout the 7-month follow-up period, the patient and her husband (who were blinded as to which side received the SBS) and the author consistently observed more favorable results for the SBS side, which included greater postoperative comfort, better shape, higher buttock position, less recurrent laxity, and less descent of the scar.",0
9219685,Crystal structure of mouse CD1: An MHC-like fold with a large hydrophobic binding groove,"CD1 represents a third lineage of antigen-presenting molecules that are distantly related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in the immune system. The crystal structure of mouse CD1d1, corresponding to human CD1d, at 2.8  resolution shows that CD1 adopts an MHC fold that is more closely related to that of MHC class I than to that of MHC class II. The binding groove, although significantly narrower, is substantially larger because of increased depth and it has only two major pockets that are almost completely hydrophobic. The extreme hydrophobicity and shape of the binding site are consistent with observations that human CD1b and CD1c can present mycobacterial cell wall antigens, such as mycolic acid and lipoarabinomannans. However, mouse CD1d1 can present very hydrophobic peptides, but must do so in a very different way from MHC class Ia and class II molecules.",1
3620733,Development of a knowledge-based system for aiding therapeutic decision in breast cancer,"The SENEX project has been initiated at the fondation Bergonie in 1985 and is intended for providing physicians in general hospitals with knowledge based systems for the management of cancer treatment protocols. The design and building of a knowledge-based system for the management of breast cancer protocols (SENEX) was the first goal of this project. SENEX has been developed using a commercially available development tool (Personal Consultant Plus, Texas-instruments) derived from EMYCIN. It runs on IBM and compatible microcomputers. The knowledge base embeds the formal knowledge contained in the breast cancer protocols currently in use at the fondation Bergonie, and some judgmental knowledge acquired form breast cancer experts. Production rules and frames allowed us to adequately represent and structure this knowledge and the problem solving processes related to the management of breast cancer. A preliminary informal evaluation of the system has shown that it performs at the expert-level in giving advice for patients included in formal protocols. Its use and acceptability are good. However, we have to add judgmental knowledge into the knowledge base and to interface the system with a temporal data base management system to improve the overall performances of SENEX. Moreover the effectiveness of the system remains to be demonstrated before one can anticipate is routine use in clinical practice.",0
14618390,Apolipoprotein B-100 XbaI gene polymorphism in gallbladder cancer,"Genetic polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein B (apoB) gene have been reported to be associated with altered serum lipids and susceptibility to cholesterol gallstones (GS). Gallstones are among the well-known risk factors for carcinoma of the gallbladder (GBC). In the present study, the association between the XbaI polymorphism of the apo B gene was examined in patients with GBC and GS and in normal controls in a north Indian population. DNA samples from patients with GBC (n=153), GS (n=117) and healthy subjects (n=137) were analysed for the apoB- XbaI polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotype X+/- was less frequent in patients with GBC (39.2%) than in those with GS (68.3%) and in normal subjects (66.4%; P<0.00001). In contrast, there was an increase in the homozygous X-/- genotype in patients with GBC (54.9%) as compared with those with GS (23.9%) and normal subjects (25.5%; P<0.00001). The frequency of the X- allele was found to be significantly increased in GBC patients with or without GS (odds ratio=2.3 and 1.7, respectively). We suggest that the apoB-XbaI gene polymorphism confers susceptibility to carcinoma of the gallbladder under specific environmental conditions.",1
2197878,Characterization of the macula densa stimulus for renin secretion,"These studies utilize the isolated perfused rabbit juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) to study the macula densa signal for renin secretion in the absence of the confounding influences of intravascular pressure and renal nerve activity. In the first experimental series, JGAs were perfused alternately with high- and low-NaCl solutions to determine the reversibility of the renin response to changes in NaCl concentration. Compared with high-NaCl controls, perfusion with a low-NaCl solution resulted in a fivefold increase in renin secretion rate (RSR) [2.1-10.0 nano-Goldblatt hog units (nGU)/min], and this response was largely reversible. When the solutions were presented in the reverse order, a similar inhibition by high NaCl was observed. In the second series, JGAs were perfused with high-, medium-, and low-NaCl solutions to determine the sensitive range of the renin response to NaCl concentration changes. The full renin response (3.2-16.6 nGU/min), similar in magnitude to that seen in series 1, was found to occur between 80 and 24 mM for Na+ and 61 and 7 mM for Cl-. In the third series, the NaCl concentration and flow rate of the perfusate were altered independently to separate the effects of flow rate, NaCl delivery, and NaCl concentration on RSR. Although a decrease in perfusate flow rate slightly increased RSR (3.4-8.1 nGU/min), a comparable decrease in NaCl concentration resulted in a much higher RSR (26.3 nGU/min). We conclude that in this preparation 1) RSR responds equally to both increases and decreases in macula densa NaCl concentration, and these changes are rapid and largely reversible, 2) the full renin response occurs within the concentration range normally occurring at the macula densa, i.e., below 80 mM Na+ and 61 mM Cl-, and 3) RSR responds with a larger change to alterations in NaCl concentration than in NaCl delivery or fluid flow rate.",0
10646609,Cbl-b regulates the CD28 dependence of T-cell activation,"Whereas co-stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) and CD28 triggers T-cell activation, stimulation of the TCR alone may result in an anergic state or T-cell deletion, both possible mechanisms of tolerance induction. Here we show that T cells that are deficient in the adaptor molecule Cbl-b (ref. 3) do not require CD28 engagement for interleukin-2 production, and that the Cbl-b-null mutation (Cbl-b(-/-)) fully restores T-cell-dependent antibody responses in CD28-/- mice. The main TCR signalling pathways, such as tyrosine kinases Zap-70 and Lck, Ras/mitogen-activated kinases, phospholipase Cgamma-1 and Ca2+ mobilization, were not affected in Cbl-b(-/-) T cells. In contrast, the activation of Vav, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1/Rho/CDC42, was significantly enhanced. Our findings indicate that Cbl-b may influence the CD28 dependence of T-cell activation by selectively suppressing TCR-mediated Vav activation. Mice deficient in Cbl-b are highly susceptible to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, suggesting that the dysregulation of signalling pathways modulated by Cbl-b may also contribute to human autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.",1
23396855,Longitudinal surveillance of bacteraemia in haematology and oncology patients at a UK cancer centre and the impact of ciprofloxacin use on antimicrobial resistance,"OBJECTIVES: To assess and compare the current trends in bacteraemia and antimicrobial resistance and analyse the impact of ciprofloxacin prescribing on Gram-negative bacterial resistance in haematology and oncology patients. METHODS: Information on bacteraemia episodes, causative pathogens, antimicrobial resistance and consumption was compared between haematology and oncology patients at a UK cancer centre in a 14 year longitudinal surveillance study. RESULTS: Haematology patients had a 3-fold higher incidence of bacteraemia compared with oncology patients (10.9/1000 versus 3.6/1000 admissions, respectively). Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common Gram-positive cause of bacteraemia for both cancer groups, whereas the overall rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia was low (0.16/1000 admissions). Escherichia coli was the most common Gram-negative cause of bacteraemia for both groups, but with a higher incidence in haematology patients (0.92/1000 admissions) compared with oncology patients (0.5/1000 admissions). Pseudomonas spp. formed the second most common Gram-negative infection in haematology patients, with a 4-fold higher bacteraemia incidence compared with oncology patients (0.76 versus 0.16/1000 admissions). Ciprofloxacin resistance of Gram-negative isolates was 22% in haematology and 5% in oncology patients. The rate of ciprofloxacin use measured showed high ciprofloxacin consumption in haematology patients compared with oncology patients (3.6 versus 1.5 defined daily doses/10 admissions, respectively), suggesting that ciprofloxacin may drive resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our longitudinal surveillance highlights the continued importance of Gram-negative bacteraemia, in particular that due to Pseudomonas, in the cancer population and raises concerns regarding increasing ciprofloxacin use and resistance.",0
23404334,Congenital myasthenic syndromes due to mutations in ALG2 and ALG14,"Congenital myasthenic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders that arise from impaired signal transmission at the neuromuscular synapse. They are characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. We performed linkage analysis, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing to determine the underlying defect in patients with an inherited limb-girdle pattern of myasthenic weakness. We identify ALG14 and ALG2 as novel genes in which mutations cause a congenital myasthenic syndrome. Through analogy with yeast, ALG14 is thought to form a multiglycosyltransferase complex with ALG13 and DPAGT1 that catalyses the first two committed steps of asparagine-linked protein glycosylation. We show that ALG14 is concentrated at the muscle motor endplates and small interfering RNA silencing of ALG14 results in reduced cell-surface expression of muscle acetylcholine receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. ALG2 is an alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase that also catalyses early steps in the asparagine-linked glycosylation pathway. Mutations were identified in two kinships, with mutation ALG2p.Val68Gly found to severely reduce ALG2 expression both in patient muscle, and in cell cultures. Identification of DPAGT1, ALG14 and ALG2 mutations as a cause of congenital myasthenic syndrome underscores the importance of asparagine-linked protein glycosylation for proper functioning of the neuromuscular junction. These syndromes form part of the wider spectrum of congenital disorders of glycosylation caused by impaired asparagine-linked glycosylation. It is likely that further genes encoding components of this pathway will be associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes or impaired neuromuscular transmission as part of a more severe multisystem disorder. Our findings suggest that treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors may improve muscle function in many of the congenital disorders of glycosylation.",1

22264513,"The UPEC pore-forming toxin alpha-hemolysin triggers proteolysis of host proteins to disrupt cell adhesion, inflammatory, and survival pathways","Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which are the leading cause of both acute and chronic urinary tract infections, often secrete a labile pore-forming toxin known as alpha-hemolysin (HlyA). We show that stable insertion of HlyA into epithelial cell and macrophage membranes triggers degradation of the cytoskeletal scaffolding protein paxillin and other host regulatory proteins, as well as components of the proinflammatory NFkappaB signaling cascade. Proteolysis of these factors requires host serine proteases, and paxillin degradation specifically involves the serine protease mesotrypsin. The induced activation of mesotrypsin by HlyA is preceded by redistribution of mesotrypsin precursors from the cytosol into foci along microtubules and within nuclei. HlyA intoxication also stimulated caspase activation, which occurred independently of effects on host serine proteases. HlyA-induced proteolysis of host proteins likely allows UPEC to not only modulate epithelial cell functions, but also disable macrophages and suppress inflammatory responses.",0
20508084,Murder and madness: a case study of the criminogenesis and psychodynamics of a dual murder,"This article presents a case of dual murder committed by a person having a narcissistic personality disorder with traits of borderline personality disorder. The man, who had no previous problem with the justice system and had never shown any aggressive behaviour, stabbed to death his lover who was leaving him and, a week later, killed his own son. Through weekly clinical sessions over a period of 11 months, the analysis of the crime dynamics, the criminogenesis, and psychodynamics of the two murders allowed the reconstruction of the offender's psychopathological frame of mind and, in particular, the hypothesis of a symbolic connection between the homicides: The first appears to have been the result of an act of power and control in order to heal his narcissistic wound, whereas the second was due to his need to expiate the first crime and so could be interpreted as a suicide by proxy.",0
2891692,Isolation and sequence of the promoter region of the human multidrug-resistance (P-glycoprotein) gene,"Intrinsic and acquired multidrug resistance is an important problem in cancer therapy. Multidrug resistance results from overexpression of the MDR 1 gene, which encodes a drug-efflux pump called P-glycoprotein. We have isolated a 1-kilobase genomic fragment containing the major transcription initiation sites for the human MDR 1 gene. Ribonuclease protection experiments using this fragment indicate that normal human adrenal, colon, and liver cells, the human hepatoma cell line HepG2, and vinblastine-selected human KB multidrug-resistant cells initiate transcription of the MDR 1 gene at the same site within this fragment. The 0.43-kilobase region upstream from the major transcription initiation site linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene showed promoter activity in CV-1 monkey kidney cells and in human KB cells. The putative promoter region has a consensus CAAT box and two GC box-like sequences, but no TATA sequence. This identification and isolation of promoter sequences for the MDR 1 gene will permit studies on how expression of this gene is regulated in normal human tissues and cancers.",1
11099417,Accumulation of dietary cholesterol in sitosterolemia caused by mutations in adjacent ABC transporters,"In healthy individuals, acute changes in cholesterol intake produce modest changes in plasma cholesterol levels. A striking exception occurs in sitosterolemia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by increased intestinal absorption and decreased biliary excretion of dietary sterols, hypercholesterolemia, and premature coronary atherosclerosis. We identified seven different mutations in two adjacent, oppositely oriented genes that encode new members of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family (six mutations in ABCG8 and one in ABCG5) in nine patients with sitosterolemia. The two genes are expressed at highest levels in liver and intestine and, in mice, cholesterol feeding up-regulates expressions of both genes. These data suggest that ABCG5 and ABCG8 normally cooperate to limit intestinal absorption and to promote biliary excretion of sterols, and that mutated forms of these transporters predispose to sterol accumulation and atherosclerosis.",1

Development of new probes has allowed the use of radiofrequency ablation for ablation of tumors > 5 cm in the liver. We present a case of acute intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria during radiofrequency ablation of a large 8-cm hepatocellular carcinoma via laparotomy.

22997869,Biomarkers in clinical medicine,"Biomarkers have been used in clinical medicine for decades. With the rise of genomics and other advances in molecular biology, biomarker studies have entered a whole new era and hold promise for early diagnosis and effective treatment of many diseases. A biomarker is a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention (1). They can be classified into five categories based on their application in different disease stages: 1) antecedent biomarkers to identify the risk of developing an illness, 2) screening biomarkers to screen for subclinical disease, 3) diagnostic biomarkers to recognize overt disease, 4) staging biomarkers to categorise disease severity, and 5) prognostic biomarkers to predict future disease course, including recurrence, response to therapy, and monitoring efficacy of therapy (1). Biomarkers can indicate a variety of health or disease characteristics, including the level or type of exposure to an environmental factor, genetic susceptibility, genetic responses to environmental exposures, markers of subclinical or clinical disease, or indicators of response to therapy. This chapter will focus on how these biomarkers have been used in preventive medicine, diagnostics, therapeutics and prognostics, as well as public health and their current status in clinical practice.",0
25101258,"Oxidation stability of biodiesel fuels and blends using the Rancimat and PetroOXY methods. Effect of 4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol and catechol as biodiesel additives on oxidation stability","IN THE PRESENT WORK, SEVERAL FATTY ACID METHYL ESTERS (FAME) HAVE BEEN SYNTHESIZED FROM VARIOUS FATTY ACID FEEDSTOCKS: used frying olive oil, pork fat, soybean, rapeseed, sunflower, and coconut. The oxidation stabilities of the biodiesel samples and of several blends have been measured simultaneously by both the Rancimat method, accepted by EN14112 standard, and the PetroOXY method, prEN16091 standard, with the aim of finding a correlation between both methodologies. Other biodiesel properties such as composition, cold filter plugging point (CFPP), flash point (FP), and kinematic viscosity have also been analyzed using standard methods in order to further characterize the biodiesel produced. In addition, the effect on the biodiesel properties of using 4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol and catechol as additives in biodiesel blends with rapeseed and with soybean has also been analyzed. The use of both antioxidants results in a considerable improvement in the oxidation stability of both types of biodiesel, especially using catechol. Adding catechol loads as low as 0.05% (m/m) in blends with soybean biodiesel and as low as 0.10% (m/m) in blends with rapeseed biodiesel is sufficient for the oxidation stabilities to comply with the restrictions established by the European EN14214 standard. An empirical linear equation is proposed to correlate the oxidation stability by the two methods, PetroOXY and Rancimat. It has been found that the presence of either catechol or 4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol as additives affects the correlation observed. ",0

15726419,A large interstitial deletion encompassing the amelogenin gene on the short arm of the Y chromosome,"Sex tests based on amelogenin are part of various PCR multiplex reaction kits widely used for human gender identification and have important applications in forensic casework, prenatal diagnosis, DNA databasing and blood sample storage. The two most common sex tests based on amelogenin are represented by primer sets that delimit a 6-bp deletion on the X chromosome to produce X/Y fragments of 106/112 or 212/218 bp, respectively. Few cases of AMELY deletion, usually considered as polymorphisms, have been reported so far and a detailed characterization of the molecular alteration is still lacking. In this study, we describe a large interstitial deletion of the Y short arm encompassing the AMELY locus in two unrelated individuals. The first case was identified in an oligozoospermic, otherwise phenotypically normal, 32-year-old man during the screening for Y microdeletions performed on a sample of infertile males. The second one was found among amniotic liquid samples tested by quantitative fluorescence-polymerase chain reaction and cytogenetic analysis for prenatal diagnosis. The extent of the deletion, spanning approximately 2.5 Mb, was better characterised by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and STS marker analysis.",1
22463271,Experimental scaling law for the subcritical transition to turbulence in plane Poiseuille flow,"We present an experimental study of the transition to turbulence in a plane Poiseuille flow. Using a well-controlled perturbation, we analyze the flow by using extensive particle image velocimetry and flow visualization (using laser-induced fluorescence) measurements, and use the deformation of the mean velocity profile as a criterion to characterize the state of the flow. From a large parametric study, four different states are defined, depending on the values of the Reynolds number and the amplitude of the perturbation. We discuss the role of coherent structures, such as hairpin vortices, in the transition. We find that the minimal amplitude of the perturbation triggering transition scales asymptotically as Re(-1).",0
10436028,Characterization of a fourth adaptor-related protein complex,"Adaptor protein complexes (APs) function as vesicle coat components in different membrane traffic pathways; however, there are a number of pathways for which there is still no candidate coat. To find novel coat components related to AP complexes, we have searched the expressed sequence tag database and have identified, cloned, and sequenced a new member of each of the four AP subunit families. We have shown by a combination of coimmunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid analysis that these four proteins (epsilon, beta4, mu4, and sigma4) are components of a novel adaptor-like heterotetrameric complex, which we are calling AP-4. Immunofluorescence reveals that AP-4 is localized to approximately 10-20 discrete dots in the perinuclear region of the cell. This pattern is disrupted by treating the cells with brefeldin A, indicating that, like other coat proteins, the association of AP-4 with membranes is regulated by the small GTPase ARF. Immunogold electron microscopy indicates that AP-4 is associated with nonclathrin-coated vesicles in the region of the trans-Golgi network. The mu4 subunit of the complex specifically interacts with a tyrosine-based sorting signal, indicating that, like the other three AP complexes, AP-4 is involved in the recognition and sorting of cargo proteins with tyrosine-based motifs. AP-4 is of relatively low abundance, but it is expressed ubiquitously, suggesting that it participates in a specialized trafficking pathway but one that is required in all cell types.",1

Still the basic part of information is to get the right data at the right time for the decision to be made. Today a large amount of operational data is available at almost any European wastewater treatment plant, from laboratory and SCADA. The difficult part is to determine which data to keep, which to use in calculations and how and where to make data available. With the STARcontrol system it is possible to separate only process relevant data to use for on-line control and reporting at engineering level, to optimise operation. Furthermore, the use of IT makes it possible to communicate internationally, with full access to the whole amount of data on the single plant. In this way, expert supervision can be both very local in local language e.g. Polish and at the same time very professional with Danish experts advising on Danish processes in Poland or Sweden where some of the 12 STARcontrol systems are running.",0
10691732,ATR disruption leads to chromosomal fragmentation and early embryonic lethality,"Although a small decrease in survival and increase in tumor incidence was observed in ATR(+/-) mice, ATR(-/-) embryos die early in development, subsequent to the blastocyst stage and prior to 7.5 days p.c. In culture, ATR(-/-) blastocysts cells continue to cycle into mitosis for 2 days but subsequently fail to expand and die of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Importantly, caspase-independent chromosome breaks are observed in ATR(-/-) cells prior to widespread apoptosis, implying that apoptosis is caused by a loss of genomic integrity. These data show that ATR is essential for early embryonic development and must function in processes other than regulation of p53.",1
31585109,"De Novo Pathogenic Variants in N-cadherin Cause a Syndromic Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Corpus Collosum, Axon, Cardiac, Ocular, and Genital Defects","Cadherins constitute a family of transmembrane proteins that mediate calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. The extracellular domain of cadherins consists of extracellular cadherin (EC) domains, separated by calcium binding sites. The EC interacts with other cadherin molecules in cis and in trans to mechanically hold apposing cell surfaces together. CDH2 encodes N-cadherin, whose essential roles in neural development include neuronal migration and axon pathfinding. However, CDH2 has not yet been linked to a Mendelian neurodevelopmental disorder. Here, we report de novo heterozygous pathogenic variants (seven missense, two frameshift) in CDH2 in nine individuals with a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, variable axon pathfinding defects (corpus callosum agenesis or hypoplasia, mirror movements, Duane anomaly), and ocular, cardiac, and genital anomalies. All seven missense variants (c.1057G>A [p.Asp353Asn]; c.1789G>A [p.Asp597Asn]; c.1789G>T [p.Asp597Tyr]; c.1802A>C [p.Asn601Thr]; c.1839C>G [p.Cys613Trp]; c.1880A>G [p.Asp627Gly]; c.2027A>G [p.Tyr676Cys]) result in substitution of highly conserved residues, and six of seven cluster within EC domains 4 and 5. Four of the substitutions affect the calcium-binding site in the EC4-EC5 interdomain. We show that cells expressing these variants in the EC4-EC5 domains have a defect in cell-cell adhesion; this defect includes impaired binding in trans with N-cadherin-WT expressed on apposing cells. The two frameshift variants (c.2563_2564delCT [p.Leu855Valfs( *)4]; c.2564_2567dupTGTT [p.Leu856Phefs( *)5]) are predicted to lead to a truncated cytoplasmic domain. Our study demonstrates that de novo heterozygous variants in CDH2 impair the adhesive activity of N-cadherin, resulting in a multisystemic developmental disorder, that could be named ACOG syndrome (agenesis of corpus callosum, axon pathfinding, cardiac, ocular, and genital defects).",1
21051556,CCR7 is involved in the migration of neutrophils to lymph nodes,"Increasing evidence suggests that neutrophils may participate in the regulation of adaptive immune responses, and can reach draining lymph nodes and cross-prime naive T cells. The aim of this study was to identify the mechanism(s) involved in the migration of neutrophils to the draining lymph nodes. We demonstrate that a subpopulation of human and mouse neutrophils express CCR7. CCR7 is rapidly expressed at the membrane upon stimulation. In vitro, stimulated human neutrophils migrate in response to the CCR7 ligands CCL19 and CCL21. In vivo, injection of complete Freund adjuvant induces a rapid recruitment of neutrophils to the lymph nodes in wild-type mice but not in Ccr7(-/-) mice. Moreover, intradermally injected interleukin-17-and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-stimulated neutrophils from wild-type mice, but not from Ccr7(-/-) mice, migrate to the draining lymph nodes. These results identify CCR7 as a chemokine receptor involved in the migration of neutrophils to the lymph nodes.",1
29070717,Substitution of Linoleic Acid for Other Macronutrients and the Risk of Ischemic Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ischemic stroke is a major health problem worldwide, but the influence of dietary factors on stroke risk is not well known. This study aimed to investigate the risk of ischemic stroke and its subtypes with a higher intake from linoleic acid and a concomitant lower intake from saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, or glycemic carbohydrates. METHODS: In the Danish prospective Diet, Cancer, and Health Study of 57 053 participants aged 50 to 64 years at baseline, information on diet was collected using a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Information on ischemic stroke was obtained from the Danish National Patient Register, and cases were all validated and subclassified according to the TOAST (Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification. Substitution of linoleic acid for saturated fatty acid, monounsaturated fatty acid, or glycemic carbohydrates was investigated in relation to the risk of ischemic stroke and subtypes. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the associations with ischemic stroke adjusting for appropriate confounders. RESULTS: During 13.5 years of follow-up 1879 participants developed ischemic stroke. A slightly lower risk of ischemic stroke was found with a 5% higher intake of linoleic acid and a concomitant lower intake of saturated fatty acid (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-1.16), monounsaturated fatty acid (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.02), and glycemic carbohydrates (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.09), although not statistically significant. Similar patterns of association were found for large-artery atherosclerosis and small-vessel occlusions. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that replacing saturated fatty acid, glycemic carbohydrate, or monounsaturated fatty acid with linoleic acid may be associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke.",0

9878398,Macromolecular assemblage of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases: identification of protein-protein interactions and characterization of a core protein,"In eukaryotes, from fly to human, nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases contribute a multienzyme complex of defined and conserved structural organization. This ubiquitous multiprotein assemblage comprises a unique bifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase, as well as the monospecific isoleucyl, leucyl, glutaminyl, methionyl, lysyl, arginyl, and aspartyl-tRNA synthetases. Three auxiliary proteins of apparent molecular masses of 18, 38 and 43 kDa are invariably associated with the nine tRNA synthetase components of the complex. As part of an inquiry into the molecular and functional organization of this macromolecular assembly, we isolated the cDNA encoding the p38 non-synthetase component and determined its function. The 320 amino acid residue encoded protein has been shown to have no homolog in yeast, bacteria and archaea, according to the examination of the complete genomic sequences available. The p38 protein is a moderately hydrophobic protein, displays a putative leucine-zipper motif, and shares a sequence pattern with protein domains that are involved in protein-protein interactions. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to register protein connections between components of the complex. We performed an exhaustive search of interactive proteins, involving 10 of the 11 components of the complex. Twenty-one protein pairs have been unambiguously identified, leading to a global view of the topological arrangement of the subunits of the multisynthetase complex. In particular, p38 was found to associate with itself to form a dimer, but also with p43, with the class I tRNA synthetases ArgRS and GlnRS, with the class II synthetases AspRS and LysRS, and with the bifunctional GluProRS. We generated a series of deletion mutants to localize the regions of p38 mediating the identified interactions. Mapping the interactive domains in p38 showed the specific association of p38 with its different protein partners. These findings suggest that p38, for which no homologous protein has been identified to date in organisms devoid of multisynthetase complexes, plays a pivotal role for the assembly of the subunits of the eukaryotic tRNA synthetase complex.",1
21438548,"Target-specific support vector machine scoring in structure-based virtual screening: computational validation, in vitro testing in kinases, and effects on lung cancer cell proliferation","We assess the performance of our previously reported structure-based support vector machine target-specific scoring function across 41 targets, 40 among them from the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD). The area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic plots (ROC-AUC) revealed that scoring with SVM-SP resulted in consistently better enrichment over all target families, outperforming Glide and other scoring functions, most notably among kinases. In addition, SVM-SP performance showed little variation among protein classes, exhibited excellent performance in a test case using a homology model, and in some cases showed high enrichment even with few structures used to train a model. We put SVM-SP to the test by virtual screening 1125 compounds against two kinases, EGFR and CaMKII. Among the top 25 EGFR compounds, three compounds (1-3) inhibited kinase activity in vitro with IC(5)(0) of 58, 2, and 10 muM. In cell cultures, compounds 1-3 inhibited nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (H1299) cancer cell proliferation with similar IC(5)(0) values for compound 3. For CaMKII, one compound inhibited kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner among 20 tested with an IC(5)(0) of 48 muM. These results are encouraging given that our in-house library consists of compounds that emerged from virtual screening of other targets with pockets that are different from typical ATP binding sites found in kinases. In light of the importance of kinases in chemical biology, these findings could have implications in future efforts to identify chemical probes of kinases within the human kinome.",0
14523446,Jelly belly protein activates the receptor tyrosine kinase Alk to specify visceral muscle pioneers,"The secreted protein Jelly belly (Jeb) is required for an essential signalling event in Drosophila muscle development. In the absence of functional Jeb, visceral muscle precursors are normally specified but fail to migrate and differentiate. The structure and distribution of Jeb protein implies that Jeb functions as a signal to organize the development of visceral muscles. Here we show that the Jeb receptor is the Drosophila homologue of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk), a receptor tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor superfamily. Human ALK was originally identified as a proto-oncogene, but its normal function in mammals is not known. In Drosophila, localized Jeb activates Alk and the downstream Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade to specify a select group of visceral muscle precursors as muscle-patterning pioneers. Jeb/Alk signalling induces the myoblast fusion gene dumbfounded (duf; also known as kirre) as well as org-1, a Drosophila homologue of mammalian TBX1, in these cells.",1
20956536,"CAMDI, a novel disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)-binding protein, is required for radial migration","Centrosomes play a crucial role in the directed migration of developing neurons. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. This study has identified a novel disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)-interacting protein, named CAMDI after coiled-coil protein associated with myosin II and DISC1, which translocates to the centrosome in a DISC1-dependent manner. Knockdown of CAMDI by shRNA revealed severely impaired radial migration with disoriented centrosomes. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified myosin II as a binding protein of CAMDI. CAMDI interacts preferentially with phosphomyosin II and induces an accumulation of phosphomyosin II at the centrosome in a DISC1-dependent manner. Interestingly, one single nucleotide polymorphism of the CAMDI gene (R828W) is identified, and its gene product was found to reduce the binding ability to phosphomyosin II. Furthermore, mice with overexpression of R828W in neurons exhibit an impaired radial migration. Our findings indicate that CAMDI is required for radial migration probably through DISC1 and myosin II-mediated centrosome positioning during neuronal development.",1
16826513,Evidence that translation reinitiation leads to a partially functional Menkes protein containing two copper-binding sites,"Menkes disease (MD) is an X-linked recessive disorder of copper metabolism. It is caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene encoding a copper-translocating P-type ATPase, which contains six N-terminal copper-binding sites (CBS1-CBS6). Most patients die in early childhood. We investigated the functional effect of a large frameshift deletion in ATP7A (including exons 3 and 4) identified in a patient with MD with unexpectedly mild symptoms and long survival. The mutated transcript, ATP7A(Delta ex3+ex4), contains a premature termination codon after 46 codons. Although such transcripts are generally degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), it was established by real-time PCR quantification that the ATP7A(Delta ex3+ex4) transcript was protected from degradation. A combination of in vitro translation, recombinant expression, and immunocytochemical analysis provided evidence that the ATP7A(Delta ex3+ex4) transcript was protected from degradation because of reinitiation of protein translation. Our findings suggest that reinitiation takes place at two downstream internal codons. The putative N-terminally truncated proteins contain only CBS5 and CBS6. Cellular localization and copper-dependent trafficking of the major part of endogenous and recombinant ATP7A(Delta ex3+ex4) proteins were similar to the wild-type ATP7A protein. Furthermore, the ATP7A(Delta ex3+ex4) cDNA was able to rescue a yeast strain lacking the homologous gene, CCC2. In summary, we propose that reinitiation of the NMD-resistant ATP7A(Delta ex3+ex4) transcript leads to the synthesis of N-terminally truncated and at-least-partially functional Menkes proteins missing CBS1-CBS4. This finding--that a mutation that would have been assumed to be null is not--highlights the need to examine the biochemical phenotype of patients to deduce the efficacy of copper therapy.",1
7845672,Molecular cloning and chromosomal localization of the human homologue of a B-lymphocyte specific protein tyrosine kinase (blk),"A cDNA encoding the human homologue of the murine protein tyrosine kinase, blk, has been cloned from a human B-lymphocyte cDNA library by cross-species hybridization using the murine blk cDNA as a probe. The sequence of the 2608 bp human blk cDNA clone contains an open reading frame encoding a predicted 505 amino acid protein with SH3, SH2 and catalytic domains that contain consensus sequences of the src protein tyrosine kinase family. Comparison of human and murine blk sequences indicated that they share 86% amino acid identity, the most conserved region being the catalytic domain (93% identity). Like the murine blk gene human blk is expressed only in B lymphocytes. The human blk gene was mapped to chromosome 8 at p22-23.",1
9119374,Two novel human members of an emerging mammalian gene family related to mono-ADP-ribosylating bacterial toxins,"Mono-ADP-ribosylation is one of the posttranslational protein modifications regulating cellular metabolism, e.g., nitrogen fixation, in prokaryotes. Several bacterial toxins mono-ADP-ribosylate and inactivate specific proteins in their animal hosts. Recently, two mammalian GPI-anchored cell surface enzymes with similar activities were cloned (designated ART1 and ART2). We have now identified six related expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in the public database and cloned the two novel human genes from which these are derived (designated ART3 and ART4). The deduced amino acid sequences of the predicted gene products show 28% sequence identity to one another and 32-41% identity vs the muscle and T cell enzymes. They contain signal peptide sequences characteristic of GPI anchorage. Southern Zoo blot analyses suggest the presence of related genes in other mammalian species. By PCR screening of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization, we have mapped the two genes to human chromosomes 4p14-p15.1 and 12q13.2-q13.3. Northern blot analyses show that these genes are specifically expressed in testis and spleen, respectively. Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences reveals a conserved exon/intron structure, with an unusually large exon encoding the predicted mature membrane proteins. Secondary structure prediction analyses indicate conserved motifs and amino acid residues consistent with a common ancestry of this emerging mammalian enzyme family and bacterial mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferases. It is possible that the four human gene family members identified so far represent the ",1

32233070,Validated LC-MS/MS method of Sphingosine 1-phosphate quantification in human serum for evaluation of response to radiotherapy in lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid, has been shown to mediate cancer processes. Therefore, accurate qualitative and quantitative determination is essential. The current assay method is still cumbersome to be of practical use worldwide and the aim of this study was therefore to develop a fast, accurate, precise and efficient LC-MS/MS method for targeted analyses of S1P in serum samples. METHODS: Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is an established method used for monitoring and analyzing S1P levels in serum. We determined the level of serum S1P in 256 patients with lung cancer and 36 healthy donors, and used Spearman';s rank correlation analysis to evaluate the difference in serum S1P levels between radiotherapy and nonradiotherapy patients. RESULTS: Standard curves were linear over ranges of 25-600 ng/mL for S1P with correlation coefficient (r(2) ) greater than 0.9996. The lower limit of quantifications (LLOQs) was 25 ng/mL. The intra- and interbatch precisions and accuracy was less than 10% for S1P. The recoveries of the method were found to be 80%-98%. Serum S1P levels in healthy donors were different from those in patients (P < 0.001). Of 256 lung cancer patients, 124 (48.4%) received radiotherapy and were identified to have concomitant low serum S1P levels (222.13 +/- 48.63), whereas 132 (51.6%) who had not received radiotherapy were identified to have high levels (315.16 +/- 51.06). The serum S1P levels were therefore associated with radiotherapy (Spearman's Rho = -0.653, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that this new LC-MS/MS method is rapid, sensitive, specific and reliable for the quantification of S1P levels in serum samples. The level of S1P in serum samples of patients with lung cancer who received radiotherapy was significantly lower than that in patients who did not receive radiotherapy. KEY POINTS: An improved method was established to quantify S1P levels in human serum by LC-MS/MS, which enabled the change in serum S1P levels in lung cancer patients to be monitored, in combination with radiotherapy, and their clinical significance to be analyzed.",0

They will approach intruders aggressively only if they outnumber them. Here the lionesses in the Serengeti are compared with another population living nearby but in strikingly different ecological circumstances. The lions of Ngorongoro Crater live at much higher densities owing to year-round availability of non-migratory prey species, but also suffer higher mortality from fighting. Playback experiments showed that lionesses in the crater differ from those in the Serengeti by approaching 'intruders' more quickly when the odds of winning are low. This increased aggression is interpreted in terms of the greater difficulty of holding a territory at high population density.",0
19168544,Deletion of eIF2beta suppresses testicular cancer incidence and causes recessive lethality in agouti-yellow mice,"The agouti-yellow (A(y)) deletion is the only genetic modifier known to suppress testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) susceptibility in mice or humans. The A(y) mutation deletes Raly and Eif2s2, and induces the ectopic expression of agouti, all of which are potential TGCT-modifying mutations. Here we report that the reduced TGCT incidence of heterozygous A(y) males and the recessive embryonic lethality of A(y) are caused by the deletion of Eif2s2, the beta subunit of translation initiation factor eIF2. We found that the incidence of affected males was reduced 2-fold in mice that were partially deficient for Eif2s2 and that embryonic lethality occurred near the time of implantation in mice that were fully deficient for Eif2s2. In contrast, neither reduced expression of Raly in gene-trap mice nor ectopic expression of agouti in transgenic or viable-yellow (A(vy)) mutants affected TGCT incidence or embryonic viability. In addition, we provide evidence that partial deficiency of Eif2s2 attenuated germ cell proliferation and differentiation, both of which are important to TGCT formation. These results show that germ cell development and TGCT pathogenesis are sensitive to the availability of the eIF2 translation initiation complex and to changes in the rate of translation.",1
10858660,The EGF-CFC gene family in vertebrate development,"EGF-CFC genes encode extracellular proteins that play key roles in intercellular signaling pathways during vertebrate embryogenesis. Mutations in zebrafish and mouse EGF-CFC genes lead to defects in germ-layer formation, anterior-posterior axis orientation and left-right axis specification. In addition, members of the EGF-CFC family have been implicated in carcinogenesis. Although formerly regarded as signaling molecules that are distant relatives of epidermal growth factor (EGF), recent findings indicate that EGF-CFC proteins act as essential cofactors for Nodal, a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family. Here, we review molecular genetic evidence from mouse and zebrafish on biological and biochemical roles of the EGF-CFC family, and discuss differing models for EGF-CFC protein function.",1
15352332,Vertical micro-distribution and response to nitrogen deposition of testate amoebae in Sphagnum,"Previous studies have shown the existence of a vertical micro-distribution of testate amoebae in the first centimeters of Sphagnum and their response to nutrient enrichment. In order to test the response of testate amoebae to depth and N addition in dry moss carpets recolonizing cutover peatlands, we sampled Sphagnum that had received 0, 1, 3, or 10g N m(-2) yr(-1) for three years. The mosses were cut into three segments: 0-1cm, 1-3cm and 3-5cm and analyzed for testate amoebae. The overall diversity (22 taxa) was high considering the dryness of the site, but the species richness of individual samples was low (mean 6.6). The presence of several species characteristic of wetter conditions suggests that they have a broader tolerance than usually believed and/or have a high colonization potential. Species richness increased with depth. Assulina muscorum was most abundant in the top segment, while Phryganella acropodia, Heleopera rosea and Nebela militaris were most abundant in the deepest segment. Neither the metabolism type nor the shell characteristics significantly explained the vertical distribution of species. There was no overall response of testate amoebae to N, although one species, Bullinularia indica, was significantly more abundant in the fertilized than in the control plots.",0

Saline extract of sheep pancreas acetone-dried powder was shown to catalyse acyl ester hydrolysis of spinach leaf galactosyl diglycerides and also galactosylglucosyl diglyceride of Lactobacillus casei. 2. Sodium deoxycholate stimulated the enzyme activity. Ca(2+) had no effect on the hydrolysis of monogalactosyl diglyceride, but it enhanced that of digalactosyl diglyceride. When added together, there was considerably less activity with both the substrates. 3. Optimal hydrolysis was observed at pH7.2. 4. The initial point of hydrolysis was at position-1, leading to the formation of monogalactosyl monoglyceride and digalactosyl monoglyceride. Further hydrolysis to the corresponding galactosylglycerols and later to galactose and glycerol was also observed, indicating the presence of alpha- and beta-galactosidases in the enzyme preparation. 5. Formation of monogalactosyl diglyceride from digalactosyl diglyceride by the action of alpha-galactosidase was noted. 6. Monogalactosyl diglyceride was also hydrolysed by beta-galactosidase to a limited extent, giving rise to diacylglycerol and galactose. 7. Attempts at purification of monogalactosyl diglyceride acyl hydrolase by using protamine sulphate treatment, Sephadex G-100 filtration and DEAE-cellulose chromatography gave a partially purified enzyme which showed 9- and 81-fold higher specific activity towards monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride respectively. This still showed acyl ester hydrolysis activity towards methyl oleate, phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerol. 8. When sheep, rat and guinea-pig tissues were compared, guinea-pig tissues showed the highest activity towards both monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride. In all the species pancreas showed higher activity than intestine.",0
11586285,Genetic inroads in familial ALS,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a common neurodegenerative disease causing cell death of motor neurons and progressive muscle weakness. The disease is familial in ten percent of cases, of which one-fifth are due to mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Two papers in this issue of Nature Genetics describe homozygous mutations in a new gene on chromosome 2q33 in 4 families of Arabian origin with a rare form of juvenile onset ALS (ALS2). The predicted protein structure has domains homologous to GTPase regulatory proteins, and both the types of mutation and the pattern of inheritance suggest that motor neuron degeneration is the result of a loss of function. Further work will determine the relevance of this breakthrough to other, more common forms of ALS.",1
25854949,Review and analysis of the review results of Taiwan nurses association nursing projects (2011~2013),"BACKGROUND: Nursing projects are a key part of N4 professional competency training for nursing personnel. Low passage rates for these projects have been shown to negatively affect the intent of nursing personnel to advance further in the nursing ladder system. PURPOSE: This study analyzes the scores for nursing projects between 2011 and 2013, the passage rate for these projects, and the differences in passage rates between different types of projects. METHOD: This retrospective and descriptive study collected data on nursing projects conducted under the auspices of the Taiwan Nurses Association between 2011 and 2013. Furthermore, the comments of reviewers on 100 nursing projects were randomly selected and subjected to content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 3,359 nursing projects were examined. Eliminating unqualified nursing projects left a total of 3,246 projects for the dataset. A total of 1,099 projects were scored with passing grades, giving a passing rate of 33.9%. The authors of these passing projects worked primarily in northern Taiwan, worked in medical centers, and worked in intensive care departments. The projects submitted by authors in central Taiwan had the highest average score and passing rate, while those living in offshore islands had the lowest average score and passing rate. Most of the project topics belonged to the category: ",0
20075215,A genetic variant BDNF polymorphism alters extinction learning in both mouse and human,"Mouse models are useful for studying genes involved in behavior, but whether they are relevant to human behavior is unclear. Here, we identified parallel phenotypes in mice and humans resulting from a common single-nucleotide polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, which is involved in anxiety-related behavior. An inbred genetic knock-in mouse strain expressing the variant BDNF recapitulated the phenotypic effects of the human polymorphism. Both were impaired in extinguishing a conditioned fear response, which was paralleled by atypical frontoamygdala activity in humans. Thus, this variant BDNF allele may play a role in anxiety disorders showing impaired learning of cues that signal safety versus threat and in the efficacy of treatments that rely on extinction mechanisms, such as exposure therapy.",1
15119972,High mortality among patients with bacterial meningitis in a rural hospital in Tanzania,"Although the disease is an important cause of mortality in the region, most published reports on bacterial meningitis in East Africa are from urban referral hospitals. Poor laboratory facilities make diagnosis difficult in the area and treatment is limited to inexpensive antibiotics. The case-fatality 'rate' in one rural hospital in Tanzania, the Ndala Mission Hospital (NMH), appears to have increased dramatically over recent years, perhaps as the result of increasing resistance to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The aim of the present study, which was partially retrospective and partially prospective, was to review the number, characteristics and outcome of children admitted to this hospital with bacterial meningitis and to investigate possible resistance of the causative micro-organisms to the antibiotics used. Data from the 181 children who were admitted with bacterial meningitis [confirmed by the examination of Gram-stained smears of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)] between 1999 and 2002 were retrospectively reviewed. The overall mortality among these children was 51%. No seasonal pattern was observed in the number of cases. In a 2-month prospective study in 2002, CSF samples from 19 consecutive cases were collected in Trans-Isolate medium and shipped to the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam for culture and analysis of antibiotic susceptibility. For only eight (42%) of the cases was there agreement between the species of bacterium identified, by Gram-staining, in Tanzania and that identified, by culture, in The Netherlands. As there was no evidence of resistance to ampicillin and the antibiotics used in the NMH were found to be of good quality, the cause of the high mortality in the NMH remains uncertain. Poor laboratory testing, long doctor-patient delays and/or poor drug administration on the wards may all be contributory factors. Attempts will now be made to address each of these problems.",0
27777122,Mapping wild-type and R345W fibulin-3 intracellular interactomes,"Fibulin-3 (F3) is an important, disulfide-rich, extracellular matrix glycoprotein that has been associated with a number of diseases ranging from cancer to retinal degeneration. An Arg345Trp (R345W) mutation in F3 causes the rare, autosomal dominant macular dystrophy, Malattia Leventinese. The purpose of this study was to identify and validate novel intracellular interacting partners of wild-type (WT) and R345W F3 in retinal pigment epithelium cells. We used stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to generate 'heavy' and 'light' isotopically labeled ARPE-19 cell populations which were subsequently infected with adenovirus encoding for FLAG-tagged WT or R345W F3. After immunoprecipitation, interacting proteins were identified by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT). We identified sixteen new intracellular F3 interacting partners, the vast majority of which are involved in protein folding and/or degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Eight of these interactions (ANXA5, ERdj5, PDIA4, P4HB, PDIA6, RCN1, SDF2L1, and TXNDC5) were verified at the western blotting level. These F3 interactome results can serve as the basis for pursuing targeted genetic or pharmacologic approaches in an effort to alter the fate of either WT or mutant F3.",0
12805306,Degeneration of the amygdala/piriform cortex and enhanced fear/anxiety behaviors in sodium pump alpha2 subunit (Atp1a2)-deficient mice,"The sodium pump is the enzyme responsible for the maintenance of Na+ and K+ gradients across the cell membrane. Four isoforms of the catalytic alpha subunit have been identified, but their individual roles remain essentially unknown. To investigate the necessary functions of the alpha2 subunit in vivo, we generated and analyzed mice defective in the alpha2 subunit gene. Mice homozygous for the alpha2 mutation died just after birth and displayed selective neuronal apoptosis in the amygdala and piriform cortex. In these regions, high expression of c-Fos before apoptosis indicated neural hyperactivity, and re-uptake of glutamic acid and GABA into P2 fraction containing crude synaptosome was impaired. These results indicate that the alpha2 subunit plays a critical role regulating neural activity in the developing amygdala and piriform cortex. Further supporting a role of the alpha2 subunit in the function of the amygdala, heterozygous adult mice showed augmented fear/anxiety behaviors and enhanced neuronal activity in the amygdala and piriform cortex after conditioned fear stimuli.",0
33199119,Compositional differences in hybrids between protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO)-inhibiting herbicide-resistant transgenic rice and weedy rice accessions,"We characterized the metabolites in grains of transgenic protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase-inhibiting herbicide-resistant rice and weedy accessions using GC-MS and examined whether the chemical composition of their hybrids differed from that of the parents. We found that the metabolite profiles of transgenic rice and weedy rice were clearly separated. Although the metabolite profiles of F2 progeny were partially separated from their parents, zygosity did not affect the profiles. The F2 progeny had similar or intermediate levels of most major nutritional components compared with their parents. However, levels of galactopyranose, trehalose, xylofuranose, mannitol, and benzoic acid were higher in the F2 progeny. Some fatty acids and organic acids also showed prominent quantitative differences between the F2 progeny and the parents. Changes in the metabolite levels of transgenic crop-weed hybrids compared to their parents might influence not only the ecological consequences of the hybrids, but also the nutritional quality and food safety.",0
27055132,Focal Inflammatory Myositis on 18F-FDG PET/CT,"Focal myositis is a rare benign inflammatory pseudotumor that can mimic malignancy, clinically and on imaging. A 34-year-old man presented with a 3-week history of sudden-onset, nontender, left upper neck mass that was nonresolving with antibiotics. Anatomical imaging was concerning for a sarcoma of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with possible regional nodal metastases and surrounding inflammatory change. F-FDG PET/CT showed marked FDG uptake extending around the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with no FDG-avid local nodal disease. Core biopsy of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and adjacent node revealed inflammatory changes. A diagnosis of focal inflammatory myositis was made. ",0
1553115,Measuring care and dependency of elderly people in residential homes: an unreliable exercise,"OBJECTIVES: to determine the correlation between a scale measuring the amount of care required by people in rest homes and two scales, the Booth scale and the composite scale which measure dependency. To examine the scales for retest reliability. SUBJECTS: one hundred and twenty-five people aged 47 to 98 years, median age 84 years, living in seven rest homes in Dunedin. METHOD: subjects were assessed using the care, Booth and composite scales and the assessment repeated after four weeks. RESULTS: the care scale test-retest reliability based on rank order correlates was 0.86. For the physical care items retest reliability was high but supervision and the management of behavioural problems showed poor retest reliability. Correlation between the care scale and the two dependency scales was only moderate (composite scale 0.64, Booth scale 0.55). Behavioural problems and the time for supervision were assessed on the care scale only and it was these components which accounted for most of the poor correlation between the care and dependency scales. CONCLUSION: the time required for the management of behavioural problems and supervision for some people in rest homes was considerable. Measurement of this was difficult and made assessment of individual residents in homes unreliable.",0
20929684,Uncertainties associated with quantifying climate change impacts on human health: a case study for diarrhea,"BACKGROUND: Climate change is expected to have large impacts on health at low latitudes where droughts and malnutrition, diarrhea, and malaria are projected to increase. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to indicate a method to assess a range of plausible health impacts of climate change while handling uncertainties in a unambiguous manner. We illustrate this method by quantifying the impacts of projected regional warming on diarrhea in this century. METHODS: We combined a range of linear regression coefficients to compute projections of future climate change-induced increases in diarrhea using the results from five empirical studies and a 19-member climate model ensemble for which future greenhouse gas emissions were prescribed. Six geographical regions were analyzed. RESULTS: The model ensemble projected temperature increases of up to 4 degrees C over land in the tropics and subtropics by the end of this century. The associated mean projected increases of relative risk of diarrhea in the six study regions were 8-11% (with SDs of 3-5%) by 2010-2039 and 22-29% (SDs of 9-12%) by 2070-2099. CONCLUSIONS: Even our most conservative estimates indicate substantial impacts from climate change on the incidence of diarrhea. Nevertheless, our main conclusion is that large uncertainties are associated with future projections of diarrhea and climate change. We believe that these uncertainties can be attributed primarily to the sparsity of empirical climate-health data. Our results therefore highlight the need for empirical data in the cross section between climate and human health.",0
10048485,Prediction of the coding sequences of unidentified human genes. XII. The complete sequences of 100 new cDNA clones from brain which code for large proteins in vitro,"In this paper, we report the sequences of 100 cDNA clones newly determined from a set of size-fractionated human brain cDNA libraries and predict the coding sequences of the corresponding genes, named KIAA0819 to KIAA0918. These cDNA clones were selected on the basis of their coding potentials of large proteins (50 kDa and more) by using in vitro transcription/translation assays. The sequence data showed that the average sizes of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames are 4.4 kb and 2.5 kb (831 amino acid residues), respectively. Homology and motif/domain searches against the public databases indicated that the predicted coding sequences of 83 genes were similar to those of known genes, 59% of which (49 genes) were categorized as coding for proteins functionally related to cell signaling/communication, cell structure/motility and nucleic acid management. The chromosomal locations and the expression profiles of all the genes were also examined. For 54 clones including brain-specific ones, the mRNA levels were further examined among 8 brain regions (amygdala, corpus callosum, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus), spinal cord, and fetal brain.",1
16232868,Oxidation of aromatic aldehyde to aromatic carboxylic acid by Burkholderia cepacia TM1 isolated from humus,"Burkholderia cepacia TM1 isolated from humus was able to oxidize aromatic aldehydes to the corresponding aromatic carboxylic acids with an extreme by high yield in distilled water containing only the aromatic aldehyde as the substrate. The molar yields of vanillic acid from vanillin, p-hydroxybenzoic acid from p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and syringic acid from syringaldehyde were approximately 94%, 92% and 72%, respectively. Until the added aromatic aldehyde was significantly consumed, consumption of the produced acid hardly occurred. The findings of this study indicate that an appropriate reactor residence time for continuous production can be set, and that aromatic carboxylic acid can be produced efficiently and continuously from the corresponding aldehyde.",0
21478940,Performance analysis of multiplexed phase computer-generated hologram for modal wavefront sensing,"We investigate the performance and capability of a holographic modal wavefront sensor (HMWS) that is based on a multiplexed phase computer-generated hologram (MPCGH). The theoretical treatments of the HMWS are presented with scalar diffraction approximations and Fourier analysis. Several MPCGHs have been designed with different linear carrier frequencies, by using of the multiplexed coding scheme we have proposed, and by coding some common Zernike modes. The numerical simulation is carried out to investigate the performance of the HMWS to detect particular aberration mode(s), by considering the effect of different carrier frequency selections and the capability of coding a large number of modes. The results exhibit the expected characteristics of a corresponding symmetric spot pair, and indicate that the wavefront distorted by a particular Zernike mode(s) can be retrieved immediately through solving the amplitude of each mode coded in MPCGHs through the response curves of the HMWS.",0
25843629,The BRAF pseudogene functions as a competitive endogenous RNA and induces lymphoma in vivo,"Research over the past decade has suggested important roles for pseudogenes in physiology and disease. In vitro experiments demonstrated that pseudogenes contribute to cell transformation through several mechanisms. However, in vivo evidence for a causal role of pseudogenes in cancer development is lacking. Here, we report that mice engineered to overexpress either the full-length murine B-Raf pseudogene Braf-rs1 or its pseudo ",1
25528205,Relationship between expression of muscle-specific uncoupling protein 2 messenger RNA and genetic selection toward growth in channel catfish,"This study tested the hypothesis that increased growth in channel catfish is associated with expression of the genes that code for uncoupling proteins (UCP) 2 and 3, members of the mitochondrial channel proteins involved in nutrient sensing and metabolism. The specific objective was to contrast the levels of UCP2 messenger RNA (mRNA) in fast vs slow growing catfish as well as in fed vs fasted catfish. Two distinct UCP2 transcripts were identified and named UCP2a and UCP2b, respectively. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence of catfish UCP2s were highly similar to UCP2 and other UCPs from other fish and mammals (>75%). Expression of UCP2a mRNA was detectable at very low levels in various metabolically active tissues, whereas the expression of UCP2b mRNA was readily detectable in the muscle and heart. In a 21-wk feeding study, fish that grew faster had a greater percent body fat at the end of the study (P < 0.01). Expression of UCP2b mRNA tended to be lower (P < 0.10) in fast growing fish in the middle of the study although levels were similar at the beginning and the end of the study. In the fed vs fasted study, expression of UCP2b mRNA in muscle was increased (P < 0.05) in fish assigned to 30 d of fasting. Our results suggest that, based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities and tissue mRNA distribution, catfish UCP2b may be the analog to UCP3. Moreover, our results suggest selection toward growth and associated fat accumulation appears to be independent of muscle UCP2b mRNA expression and UCP2b-mediated mechanisms.",0
22431149,The minute brain of the copepod Tigriopus californicus supports a complex ancestral ground pattern of the tetraconate cerebral nervous systems,"Copepods are a diverse and ecologically crucial group of minute crustaceans that are relatively neglected in terms of studies on nervous system organization. Recently, morphological neural characters have helped clarify evolutionary relationships within Arthropoda, particularly among Tetraconata (i.e., crustaceans and hexapods), and indicate that copepods occupy an important phylogenetic position relating to both Malacostraca and Hexapoda. This taxon therefore provides the opportunity to evaluate those neural characters common to these two clades likely to be results of shared ancestry (homology) versus convergence (homoplasy). Here we present an anatomical characterization of the brain and central nervous system of the well-studied harpacticoid copepod species Tigriopus californicus. We show that this species is endowed with a complex brain possessing a central complex comprising a protocerebral bridge and central body. Deutocerebral glomeruli are supplied by the antennular nerves, and a lateral protocerebral olfactory neuropil corresponds to the malacostracan hemiellipsoid body. Glomeruli contain synaptic specializations comparable to the presynaptic ",0
10474675,Laryngeal amyloidosis with laryngocele,"Both laryngocele and laryngeal amyloidosis are uncommon, and simultaneous occurrences of these entities are extremely rare. A case of laryngeal amyloidosis with laryngocele in which the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the larynx, clearly demonstrating both disease processes, is discussed. Diagnosis is confirmed by histopathologic specimens. Only two cases have been reported in the world literature, and this is the third case of laryngeal amyloidosis associated with laryngocele.",0
11483362,Structural organization of the rat mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 2 gene,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs) are dual specificity protein phosphatases that specifically inactivate MAPKs. Regulated expression of MKPs plays a key role in determining their physiological function. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of the activation of MKP genes. In this study, we cloned the rat MKP-2 gene and characterized its structure. The MKP-2 gene has four exons and three introns. The organization of exons of the MKP-2 gene is very similar to that of the MKP-1 gene, suggesting that MKP-1 and MKP-2 are derived from the same ancestral gene. We identified multiple transcription start sites (TSSs) for the MKP-2 gene. There is no functional TATA motif in the 5' proximal region of the TSSs. Instead, this region is highly GC-rich and has two putative Sp1 sites. A 1.8 kb 5' flanking region of the MKP-2 gene is sufficient to mediate transcriptional activation of the luciferase reporter gene by phorbol ester in GH3 cells. These results provide essential information about structural organization and regulatory sequences of the MKP-2 gene for further investigation of the molecular mechanisms of MKP-2 induction by extracellular stimuli.",0
22260427,Early pain after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. A qualitative systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Early post-operative pain after laparoscopic groin hernia repair may, as in other laparoscopic operations, have its own individual pain pattern and patient-related predictors of early pain. The purpose of this review was to characterise pain within the first post-operative week after transabdominal pre-peritoneal repair (TAPP) and total extraperitoneal repair (TEP), and to identify patient-related predictors of early pain. METHODS: A qualitative systematic review was conducted. Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane database were searched for studies on early pain (first week) after TAPP or TEP. RESULTS: We included 71 eligible studies with 14,023 patients. Post-operative pain is most severe on day 0 and mainly on a level of 13-58 mm on a visual analogue scale and decreases to low levels on day 3. There seems to be no difference in pain intensity and duration when TEP and TAPP are compared. Deep abdominal pain (i.e. groin pain/visceral pain) dominates over superficial pain (i.e. somatic pain) and shoulder pain (i.e. referred pain) after TAPP. Predictors of early pain are young age and pre-operative high pain response to experimental heat stimulation. Furthermore, evidence supported early pain intensity as a predictive risk factor of chronic pain after laparoscopic groin hernia repair. CONCLUSION: Early pain within the first week after TAPP and TEP is most severe on the first post-operative day, and the pain pattern is dominated by deep abdominal pain. Early post-operative pain is most intense in younger patients and can be predicted by pre-operative high pain response to experimental heat stimulation.",0
10479485,Combined adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase deficiency,"We describe a Czech patient with combined adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency (2,8-dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis) and N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (GALNS) deficiency (mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA, Morquio disease A). Adenine and its extremely insoluble derivative, 2,8-dihydroxyadenine, were identified in the urine, and APRT deficiency was confirmed in erythrocytes. There was excessive excretion of keratan sulfate in the urine, and GALNS deficiency was confirmed in leukocytes. GALNS and APRT are both located on chromosome 16q24.3, suggesting that the patient had a deletion involving both genes. PCR amplification of genomic DNA indicated that a novel junction was created by the fusion of sequences distal to GALNS exon 2 and proximal to APRT exon 3, and that the size of the deleted region was approximately 100 kb. The deletion breakpoints were localized within GALNS intron 2 and APRT intron 2. Several other genes, including the alpha subunit of cytochrome B (CYBA), which is deleted or mutated in the autosomal form of chronic granulomatous disease, are located in the 16q24.3 region, but PCR amplification showed that this gene was present in the proband. A patient with hemizygosity for GALNS deficiency and APRT deficiency has been reported from Japan recently. These findings indicate that: (i) APRT is located telomeric to GALNS; (ii) GALNS and APRT are transcribed in the same orientation (centromeric to telomeric); and (iii) combined APRT/GALNS deficiency may be more common than hitherto realized.",1
24263190,VEGF targets the tumour cell,"The function of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in cancer is not limited to angiogenesis and vascular permeability. VEGF-mediated signalling occurs in tumour cells, and this signalling contributes to key aspects of tumorigenesis, including the function of cancer stem cells and tumour initiation. In addition to VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, the neuropilins are crucial for mediating the effects of VEGF on tumour cells, primarily because of their ability to regulate the function and the trafficking of growth factor receptors and integrins. This has important implications for our understanding of tumour biology and for the development of more effective therapeutic approaches. ",0
16506228,"Quiescent gemmules of the freshwater sponge, Spongilla lacustris (Linnaeus, 1759), contain remarkably high levels of Hsp70 stress protein and hsp70 stress gene mRNA","With the onset of changing environmental conditions in autumn, the freshwater sponge Spongilla lacustris (Linnaeus, 1759) produces resistant stages (gemmules) which are in the state of quiescence. Gemmules stored at 8 degrees C remained quiescent; however, germination occurred within 24 hr after the water temperature was increased to 22.5 degrees C. Sponges hatched through the micropyle and subsequently built new spicules and a new canal system. The molecular and biochemical mechanisms which enable the gemmules to survive long periods of adverse conditions are not known. For the first time we focused on the role of the stress protein Hsp70 and the expression of hsp70 mRNA in S. lacustris during the development of gemmules in the state of quiescence into growing sponges. The partial sequence of hsp70 seems to be a true hsp gene since transcription could be clearly enhanced by temperature elevation. The results showed a large pool of cellular Hsp70 and hsp70 mRNA in gemmules during the state of quiescence. Within hours after a temperature trigger, the Hsp70 level decreased slowly and reached approximately the level of an adult sponge. Hsp70 presumably allows gemmules to stabilize their proteins and membranes during dormancy from autumn to spring when water temperatures change.",0
18284656,Heart and brain circulation and CO2 in healthy men,"AIM: To compare blood flow response to arterial carbon dioxide tension change in the heart and brain of normal elderly men. METHODS: Thirteen healthy elderly male volunteers were studied. Hypercapnea was induced by carbon dioxide inhalation and hypocapnea was induced by hyperventilation. Myocardial blood flow [mL min(-1) x (100 g of perfusable tissue)(-1)] and cerebral blood flow [mL min(-1) x (100 g of perfusable tissue)(-1)] were measured simultaneously at rest, under carbon dioxide gas inhalation and hyperventilation using the combination of two positron emission tomography scanners. RESULTS: Arterial carbon dioxide tension increased significantly during carbon dioxide inhalation (43.1 +/- 2.7 mmHg, P < 0.05) and decreased significantly during hyperventilation (29.2 +/- 3.4 mmHg, P < 0.01) from baseline (40.2 +/- 2.4 mmHg). Myocardial blood flow increased significantly during hypercapnea (88.7 +/- 22.4, P < 0.01) from baseline (78.2 +/- 12.6), as did the cerebral blood flow (baseline: 39.8 +/- 5.3 vs. hypercapnea: 48.4 +/- 10.4, P < 0.05). During hypocapnea cerebral blood flow decreased significantly (27.0 +/- 6.3, P < 0.01) from baseline as did the myocardial blood flow (55.1 +/- 14.6, P < 0.01). However, normalized myocardial blood flow by cardiac workload [100 mL mmHg(-1) x (heart beat)(-1) x (gram of perfusable tissue)(-1)] was not changed from baseline (93.4 +/- 16.6) during hypercapnea (90.5 +/- 14.3) but decreased significantly from baseline during hypocapnea (64.5 +/- 18.3, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In normal elderly men, hypocapnea produces similar vasoconstriction both in the heart and brain. Mild hypercapnea increased cerebral blood flow but did not have an additional effect to dilate coronary arteries beyond the expected range in response to an increase in cardiac workload.",0
19492566,MRSA colonisation in patients admitted with hip fracture: implications for prevention of surgical site infection,"In a prospective study we assessed 440 patients, sequentially admitted to the trauma unit with hip fracture. Of the 403 who had a swab on admission, 5.2% (21/403) were found to be colonised with MRSA. Fifty two percent of MRSA colonised patients were admitted from their own home, 29% from residential homes and 19% from nursing homes. MRSA colonisation was found in 3.6% of patients admitted from their own home, 10.9% of residential home patients, and 17.4% of nursing home patients. A high proportion (80.9%) of colonised patients had been admitted to a hospital within the previous one year, and the high prevalence of previous hospitalisation among people from institutional care may explain the higher rates of MRSA carriage among these individuals. When a patient gives a history of hospitalisation within the previous year, it is clearly sensible to consider the use of an agent such as teicoplanin for perioperative prophylaxis.",0
21569208,Protein aggregation and amyloid fibril formation prediction software from primary sequence: towards controlling the formation of bacterial inclusion bodies,"Proteins might aggregate into ordered or amorphous structures, utilizing relatively short sequence stretches, usually organized in beta-sheet-like assemblies. Here, we attempt to list all available software, developed during the last decade or so, for the prediction of such aggregation-prone stretches from protein primary structure, without distinguishing whether these algorithms predict amino acid sequences destined to be involved in ordered fibrillar amyloids or amorphous aggregates. The results of application of four of these programs on 23 proteins related to amyloidoses are compared. Because protein aggregation during protein production in bacterial cell factories has been shown to resemble amyloid formation, the algorithms might become useful tools to improve the solubility of recombinant proteins and for screening therapeutic approaches against amyloidoses under conditions that mimic physiologically relevant environments. One such example is given.",0
21751735,Cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation for patients with ventricular assist device from exercise therapy to long-term therapy. Part I: Exercise therapy,"In the present context of an aging population, limited donor heart availability, improved reliability of mechanical cardiac support and improved patient outcomes, ventricular assist device (VAD) options to support end-stage heart failure patients are rapidly expanding. In addition, both the smaller size and lighter weight of the pumps now produced and early evidence that these third generation devices may be associated with lower risk of infection and right ventricular failure will probably lead to greater physician and patient acceptability. This is the first of a two-part review on the role of cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation in patients with VAD. In this first part, we will discuss the role of exercise therapy in VAD patients, while the second will focus on long-term management. One of the prerequisites for use of a VAD--whether permanent (as destination therapy) or semi-permanent (as an alternative to heart transplantation)--is that exercise capacity, although not normal, must be adequate for daily life activities. An intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation program has the potential to increase exercise performance and improve the quality of life of VAD patients. Both early progressive mobilization and exercise training may improve the overall condition of VAD patients, and favorably impact their clinical course.",0
25071849,Comparison of clinical outcomes between fresh embryo transfers and frozen-thawed embryo transfers,"BACKGROUND: Advances in embryo culture technology and cryopreservation have led to a shift in in vitro fertilization (IVF) from early fresh or frozen-thawed cleavage embryo transfer to fresh or frozen-thawed blastocyst stage transfer. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical outcomes of fresh embryo transfers and frozen-thawed embryo transfers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective case control study, patients undergoing IVF cycles from January 2012 to December 2012 were enrolled in Assisted Reproduction of Wuhan Union Hospital were enrolled. A total of 1891 cycle contains 1150 fresh embryo transfers and 741 frozen-thawed embryo transfers were studied. All data were transferred directly to SPSS 18 and analyzed. RESULTS: Clinical pregnancy rates of fresh cleavage-stage embryo transfers compared with fresh blastocyst transfers, frozen-thawed cleavage-stage embryo transfers, post thaw cleavage-stage extended blastocyst culture transfers and frozen-thawed blastocyst transfers were 52.7%, 35.88%, 35.29%, 47.75%, 59.8% in patients under 35 years of ages and 41.24%, 26.92%, 11.32%, 46.15%, 55.8% in patients older than 35 years old, respectively. The multiple pregnancy rates, abortion rates and ectopic pregnancy rates did not differ significantly among the five groups. CONCLUSION: The clinical pregnancy rates were not different significantly between fresh cleavage-stage embryo transfers and fresh blastocyst transfers. But the clinical pregnancy rate of frozen-thawed blastocyst transfer was the highest among fresh/frozen-thawed embryo transfers.",0

27685260,Genomic Regions Associated With Interspecies Communication in Dogs Contain Genes Related to Human Social Disorders,"Unlike their wolf ancestors, dogs have unique social skills for communicating and cooperating with humans. Previously, significant heritabilities for human-directed social behaviors have been found in laboratory beagles. Here, a Genome-Wide Association Study identified two genomic regions associated with dog's human-directed social behaviors. We recorded the propensity of laboratory beagles, bred, kept and handled under standardized conditions, to initiate physical interactions with a human during an unsolvable problem-task, and 190 individuals were genotyped with an HD Canine SNP-chip. One genetic marker on chromosome 26 within the SEZ6L gene was significantly associated with time spent close to, and in physical contact with, the human. Two suggestive markers on chromosome 26, located within the ARVCF gene, were also associated with human contact seeking. Strikingly, four additional genes present in the same linkage blocks affect social abilities in humans, e.g., SEZ6L has been associated with autism and COMT affects aggression in adolescents with ADHD. This is, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide study presenting candidate genomic regions for dog sociability and inter-species communication. These results advance our understanding of dog domestication and raise the use of the dog as a novel model system for human social disorders.",0
18093360,Factors prolonging length of stay in the cardiac intensive care unit following the arterial switch operation,"The arterial switch operation has become the preferred procedure for surgical management of transposition, defined on the basis of concordant atrioventricular and discordant ventriculo-arterial connections. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of our experience in 61 infants with this segmental combination, seen from January, 1997, to July, 2003, in order to determine the factors that are associated with a prolonged postoperative course. Factors independently associated with a prolonged postoperative stay in the cardiac intensive care unit included prematurity, difficulty in feeding, capillary leak, need for preoperative inotropic support, and postoperative infectious complications. Future research is warranted designed to minimize the impact of capillary leak and postoperative infectious complications. In addition, based on these results, our practice has evolved to initiate enteral feedings in the preoperative period if feasible, with such enteral feedings resumed as soon as possible following surgery.",0
2968949,Human factor H (beta 1H-globulin): linkage analysis,"Linkage data on human factor H (HF) and 22 other human genetic markers are presented. Close linkage at theta less than 0.10 can be ruled out for a series of marker systems (Rh, PGM1, ACP1, Jk, Tf, Gc, MNSs, ME2, HLA, GLO1, ORM, Gt, PI, Hp, GPT). Strong evidence for linkage was obtained for peptidase A (PEPA) with lods greater than 3.0 at theta = 0.10 in males and at theta = 0.20 for the sexes combined. From this result the HF locus can be provisionally assigned to chromosome 18.",1
15235021,Germline E-cadherin mutations in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer: assessment of 42 new families and review of genetic screening criteria,"BACKGROUND: Mutations in the E-cadherin (CDH1) gene are a well documented cause of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Development of evidence based guidelines for CDH1 screening for HDGC have been complicated by its rarity, variable penetrance, and lack of founder mutations. METHODS: Forty three new gastric cancer (GC) families were ascertained from multiple sources. In 42 of these families at least one gastric cancer was pathologically confirmed to be a diffuse gastric cancer (DGC); the other family had intestinal type gastric cancers. Screening of the entire coding region of the CDH1 gene and all intron/exon boundaries was performed by bi-directional sequencing. RESULTS: Novel mutations were found in 13 of the 42 DGC families (31% overall). Twelve of these mutations occur among the 25 families with multiple cases of gastric cancer and with pathologic confirmation of diffuse gastric cancer phenotype in at least one individual under the age of 50 years. The mutations found include small insertions and deletions, splice site mutations, and three non-conservative amino acid substitutions (A298T, W409R, and R732Q). All three missense mutations conferred loss of E-cadherin function in in vitro assays. Multiple cases of breast cancers including pathologically confirmed lobular breast cancers were observed both in mutation positive and negative families. CONCLUSION: Germline truncating CDH1 mutations are found in 48% of families with multiple cases of gastric cancer and at least one documented case of DGC in an individual under 50 years of age. We recommend that these criteria be used for selecting families for CDH1 mutational analysis.",1

28819822,Endovascular Aneurysm Repair with Balloon Thrombectomy for Acute Thrombosis of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,"Acute occlusion of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a rare complication and is usually treated with surgical reconstruction. We present a case of acute AAA occlusion that was successfully treated by endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with Fogarty balloon thrombectomy. A 77-year-old man with a history of acute myocardial ischemia presented with limb weakness and coldness. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a 42-mm-diameter infrarenal AAA that was completely thrombosed in the distal portion. The proximal neck of the aneurysm was patent, and its shape was suitable for EVAR. Therefore, we performed balloon thrombectomy of the aortoiliac thrombus that was followed by EVAR. EVAR can be a less invasive alternative than traditional treatment for acute occlusion of AAA.",0

25135642,"Molecular characterization of arylsulfatase G: expression, processing, glycosylation, transport, and activity","Arylsulfatase G (ARSG) is a recently identified lysosomal sulfatase that was shown to be responsible for the degradation of 3-O-sulfated N-sulfoglucosamine residues of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. Deficiency of ARSG leads to a new type of mucopolysaccharidosis, as described in a mouse model. Here, we provide a detailed molecular characterization of the endogenous murine enzyme. ARSG is expressed and proteolytically processed in a tissue-specific manner. The 63-kDa single-chain precursor protein localizes to pre-lysosomal compartments and tightly associates with organelle membranes, most likely the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, proteolytically processed ARSG fragments of 34-, 18-, and 10-kDa were found in lysosomal fractions and lost their membrane association. The processing sites and a disulfide bridge between the 18- and 10-kDa chains could be roughly mapped. Proteases participating in the processing were identified as cathepsins B and L. Proteolytic processing is dispensable for hydrolytic sulfatase activity in vitro. Lysosomal transport of ARSG in the liver is independent of mannose 6-phosphate, sortilin, and Limp2. However, mutation of glycosylation site N-497 abrogates transport of ARSG to lysosomes in human fibrosarcoma cells, due to impaired mannose 6-phosphate modification. ",1

11177519,Cognitive biases and addiction: an evolution in theory and method,"An evolution in theoretical models and methodological paradigms for investigating cognitive biases in the addictions is discussed. Anomalies in traditional cognitive perspectives, and problems with the self-report methods which underpin them, are highlighted. An emergent body of cognitive research, contextualized within the principles and paradigms of cognitive neuropsychology rather than social learning theory, is presented which, it is argued, addresses these anomalies and problems. Evidence is presented that biases in the processing of addiction-related stimuli, and in the network of propositions which motivate addictive behaviours, occur at automatic, implicit and pre-conscious levels of awareness. It is suggested that methods which assess such implicit cognitive biases (e.g. Stroop, memory, priming and reaction-time paradigms) yield findings which have better predictive utility for ongoing behaviour than those biases determined by self-report methods of introspection. The potential utility of these findings for understanding ",0
10712333,Treatment with nasal CPAP decreases automobile accidents in patients with sleep apnea,"We studied 50 consecutive patients to test the hypothesis that successful treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nasal CPAP) will decrease automobile accidents in patients with sleep apnea. Thirty-six (72%) of the patients reported using nasal CPAP regularly during 2 yr. Fourteen patients reported they had not used CPAP during 2 yr. The patients with sleep apnea in this study had a higher automobile crash rate than all drivers in the state of Colorado (0.07 versus 0. 01 crash per driver per year, p < 0.02). Patients who were treated with nasal CPAP had a lower crash rate while being treated than before treatment (0.07 versus 0 crash per driver per year, p < 0.03). Untreated patients with sleep apnea continued to have a high crash rate (0.07 crash per driver before and after diagnosis). Drivers with sleep apnea were reluctant to report their automobile crashes, for the drivers in this study reported only one-third of the crashes in which they were involved. This is the first study to confirm with traffic records that patients with sleep apnea have fewer automobile crashes while being treated with nasal CPAP.",0
32840900,Culicoides biting midges and mosquito fauna at three dog and cat shelters in rural and periurban areas in Northern Spain,"The diversity and abundance of Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) and mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) were studied in three animal protection centres (APCs) in Northern Spain between 1 July and 31 October 2018. Four miniature suction CDC light traps (two UV and two standard incandescent bulb traps, both types baited and non-baited with CO2 ) were placed in each APC to compare their efficiency in the collection of these Diptera groups. A total of 1176 biting midges (14 species), 224 mosquitoes (8 species) and 1 black fly were collected and identified by both morphological and molecular approaches. The Culicoides obsoletus complex (C. obsoletus/C. scoticus) accounted for 58.2% of the total collection within the Ceratopogonidae family, whereas Culex pipiens/Cx. torrentium comprised 76.8% of the Culicidae. The input of CO2 in light traps proved largely ineffective in improving the collections of both Diptera groups. UV-light traps were 7.8 and 2.2 times more effective than incandescent light traps in trapping Culicoides and mosquitoes, respectively. Seasonal dynamics differed between both Diptera taxa but captures of both taxa were significantly larger at the beginning of the summer. The epidemiological relevance of the most prevalent species is also discussed.",0
8730340,"Neurotoxicity, anticoagulant activity and evidence of rhabdomyolysis in patients bitten by death adders (Acanthophis sp.) in southern Papua New Guinea","Thirty-two patients with enzyme-immunoassay-proven death adder (Acanthophis sp.) bites were studied in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. Eighteen were envenomed; local signs were rare and none had incoagulable blood, but all except one had signs of neurotoxicity. Five (27.7%) envenomed patients required intubation and ventilation. One patient developed renal failure, previously undescribed following death adder bites. Laboratory investigations showed mild prolongation of prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times in some patients. In vitro studies showed that the venom contains anticoagulant activity, but does not cause fibrinogenolysis. In contrast to taipan envenoming, neurotoxicity did not progress after antivenom administration, and there was reversal of neurotoxicity, evident within 6 h, in three severely envenomed patients treated less than 12 h after the bite. One patient treated with antivenom and anticholinesterases had the most dramatic response to treatment; the optimum management of bites by this species may include prompt treatment with both antivenom and anticholinesterases in addition to effective first aid.",0
14674552,Revisiting nitrate concentrations in the Des Moines River: 1945 and 1976-2001,"Recent compilations of historical and contemporary riverine nitrate (NO3) concentrations indicate that concentrations in many rivers in the north-central USA increased during the second half of the 20th century. The Des Moines River near Des Moines, Iowa, however, was reported to have had similar NO3 concentrations in 1945 and the 1980s, in spite of substantially greater N input to the watershed during the latter period. The objective of this study was to reconsider the comparison of historical and contemporary NO3 concentrations in the Des Moines River near Des Moines in light of the following: (i) possible errors in the historical data used, (ii) variations in methods of sample collection, (iii) variations in location of sampling, and (iv) additional data collected since 1990. We discovered that an earlier study had compared the flow-weighted average concentration in 1945 to arithmetic annual average concentrations in the 1980s. The intertemporal comparison also appeared to be influenced by differences in sample collection methods and locations used at different times. Depending on the model used and the estimated effects of composite sample collection, the 1945 arithmetic average NO3 concentration was between 44 and 57% of the expected mean value at a similar water yield during 1976-2001. The flow-weighted average NO3 concentration for 1945 was between 54 and 73% of the expected mean value at a similar water yield during 1976-2001. The difference between NO3 concentrations in 1945 and the contemporary period are larger than previously reported for the Des Moines River.",0
1374391,Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding human muscle glycogen debranching enzyme,"cDNA comprising the entire length of the human muscle glycogen debranching enzyme was cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. The debrancher mRNA includes a 4545-base pair coding region and a 2371-base pair 3'-nontranslated region. The calculated molecular mass of the debrancher protein derived from cDNA sequence is 172,614 daltons, consistent with the estimated size of purified protein (Mr 165,000 +/- 500). A partial amino acid sequence (13 internal tryptic peptides with a total of 213 residues) determined on peptides derived from purified porcine muscle debrancher protein confirmed the identity of the cDNA clone. Comparison of the amino acid sequence predicted from the human glycogen debrancher cDNA with the partial protein sequence of the porcine debrancher revealed a high degree (88%) of interspecies sequence identity. RNA blot analysis showed that debrancher mRNA in human muscle, lymphoblastoid cells, and in porcine muscle are all similar in size (approximately 7 kilobases). Two patients with inherited debrancher deficiency had a reduced level of debrancher mRNA, whereas two other patients had no detectable abnormality in RNA blots. The isolation of the debrancher cDNA and determination of its primary structure is an important step toward defining the structure-function relationship of this multifunctional enzyme and in understanding the molecular basis of the type III glycogen storage disease.",1
6659846,Metabolism of thyroid hormones in isolated rat hepatocytes: studies on the influences of carbamazepine and phenytoin,"The in vitro handling of thyroid hormones was studied in isolated rat hepatocytes by measuring 1) the cellular uptake of T4, 2) the conversion of T4 to T3 and 3) the degradation of T4 and T3. The in vitro conversion of T4 to T3 increased significantly by adding ethanol 2% or carbamazepine (CBZ) 400 microM in ethanol 2% to the incubation medium. As there was no difference between ethanol and CBZ/ethanol on the T3 formation, this effect was probably caused by ethanol. The T3 formation was unaffected by phenytoin (PHT) in conc. up to 400 microM, while propylthiouracil (PTU) 100 and 400 microM inhibited the conversion completely. The T4 to T3 conversion in hepatocytes from rats pretreated with CBZ or PHT for 2 weeks was not significantly different from untreated controls. The cellular uptake of T4 was reduced by about 30% in the presence of PHT and unaltered by CBZ and ethanol. The degradation of T4 and T3 was not influenced by the in vitro addition of CBZ or PHT, nor was the degradation of T4 and T3 significantly different from untreated controls in hepatocyte suspensions from CBZ or PHT pretreated rats. Our findings suggest that the handling of thyroid hormones in isolated rat hepatocytes is not influenced by the in vitro or in vivo exposure to CBZ or PHT.",0
31873776,Is the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation technique superior to Shaker exercises in swallowing rehabilitation?,"PURPOSE: This prospective study was planned to investigate whether the combined isotonic technique of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is superior to Shaker exercises in improving the function of swallowing muscles. METHODS: Fifty individuals (30 females and 20 males; mean age 68 +/- 3.89 years) with swallowing difficulties were separated into two groups randomly. The treatment groups were Shaker and PNF groups, which performed these exercises three times in a week for6 weeks. Swallowing difficulties were determined with the Turkish version of the eating assessment tool (T-EAT-10). The 100 ml-water swallow test was used to measure capacity, volume, and speed of swallowing. Contraction amplitude changes used as a universal measurement of motor unit activity during the muscle action were measured with superficial electromyography. RESULT: After 6 weeks of exercise training, T-EAT-10 scores decreased in both groups (p < 0.001). Water swallowing capacity and volume improved in both groups (p < 0.001). There was no change in swallowing speed in both groups (p > 0.05). Maximal voluntary contraction values of suprahyoid muscles were higher in PNF than the Shaker group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both the types of exercise can be used in the rehabilitation of swallowing difficulties. However, the PNF technique increased the contraction amplitude values that occur during maximum contraction more than the Shaker exercises. Different functional evaluations are needed to determine the effectiveness of PNF on swallowing difficulty.",0
1696692,Spinal and muscle motor evoked potentials following magnetic stimulation in cats,"Motor evoked potentials (MEP) from transcranial magnetic stimulation were successfully recorded from the spinal cord and gastrocnemius muscle in cats. The spinal MEP consisted of four negative peaks, N1 through N4, and subsequent small, multiphasic waves. The conduction velocity calculated from N1 corresponded to that of the nonpyramidal cerebellar evoked potential. After ablation of the pyramidal tract at various levels, N1 through N3 persisted, whereas N4 disappeared. The muscle MEP showed the same latency as that of MEP obtained by direct cortical electrical stimulation and disappeared after similar ablation. These findings suggest that the first three peaks of the spinal MEP are responses of the nonpyramidal cerebellospinal pathways and that the fourth peak of the spinal MEP and the muscle MEP are pyramidal tract responses. Spinal and muscle MEP from magnetic stimulation may be valuable in the qualitative evaluation of the function of the pyramidal and nonpyramidal pathways.",0
27182654,Unfolding and inactivation of proteins by counterions in protein-nanoparticles interaction,"In this work, the structure and activity of proteins; such as, hen egg lysozyme (HEWL) and calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP); have been investigated after incubation with surface coated iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) in water. IONPs were coated with counterions bound charge-ligands and were named as the charge-ligand counterions iron oxide nanoparticles (CLC-IONPs). The coating was done with tri-lithium citrate (TLC) and tri-potassium citrate (TKC) to have negative surface charge of CLC-IONPs and Li(+) and K(+), respectively, as counterions. To have positive surface charge, IONPs were coated with cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and cetylpyridinium iodide (CPI) having Cl(-) and I(-), respectively, as counterions. The secondary structure of proteins was measured using far ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy which showed that both proteins were irreversibly unfolded after incubation with CLC-IONPs. The unfolded proteins were seen to be functionally inactive, as confirmed through their activity assays, i.e., HEWL with Escherichia coli (E. coli) and CIAP with para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP). Additionally, we have observed that monomeric hemoglobin (Hb) from radio-resistant insect Chironomus ramosus (ChHb) was also partially unfolded upon interaction with CLC-IONPs. This work clearly shows the role of counterions in protein inactivation via protein-nanoparticles interaction and, therefore, CLC-IONPs could be used for therapeutic purpose. ",0

Lymphoma cells from three patients with immunoblastic sarcoma contained classic cytoplasmic, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive Russell bodies. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed monoclonal IgG (k) in two cases and a polyclonal pattern in the third case, where the tumor evolved from a reactive lesion.

In one case large globular structures lacking a distinct limiting membrane were seen, while the cells of the other patient contained ",0
25196863,"Diffusion tensor imaging, intracranial vascular resistance and cognition in middle-aged asymptomatic subjects","BACKGROUND: The contribution of traditional vascular risk factors to cognitive impairment and dementia is well known. However, in order to obtain possible targets for prevention of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), it may be important to identify other early and noninvasive markers in asymptomatic middle-aged adults. The calculation of middle cerebral artery-pulsatility index (MCA-PI) is an ultrasonologic, noninvasive, validated and easily reproducible technique to assess increased distal resistance to blood flow. This study aims to assess the relationship between MCA-PI, microstructural white matter (WM) integrity and cognition in a middle-aged asymptomatic population. METHODS: Ninety-five participants from the Barcelona-Asymptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerosis (AsIA) neuropsychology study were included. Subjects were 50-65 years old, free from dementia and without history of vascular disease. Transcranial color-coded duplex ultrasound examination was performed to assess MCA-PI as a measure of vascular resistance. WM integrity was evaluated by fractional anisotropy (FA) measurements of diffusion tensor images (DTI) acquired on a 3T-MRI. The neuropsychological battery was specifically selected to be sensitive to VCI, and included tests that were grouped into six cognitive domains: executive functioning, attention, verbal fluency, memory, visuospatial skills and psychomotor speed. A multivariate linear regression model adjusted for age, gender, years of education, diabetes and hypertension was performed. RESULTS: MCA-PI was significantly associated with WM disintegration in different tracts (fornix, corticospinal and anterior thalamic), all p < 0.05 uncorrected. Both mean MCA-PI and mean FA of those significant tracts were independently associated with poor performance in attention, psychomotor speed, and visuospatial skills after adjustment for age, gender, years of education, and vascular risk factors (all p < 0.05). MCA-PI was independently associated with lower scores in all cognitive domains, except for visuospatial skills. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that MCA-PI may be related to WM disintegration and early vascular cognitive impairment in middle-aged subjects. Although further prospective studies are needed to provide evidence for its validity in longitudinal studies, our results support the proposal of including MCA-PI as part of clinical assessment in order to identify targets for VCI prevention.",0
29287729,Efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for procedural pain relief in adults undergoing burn wound care: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"The aim of the present meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for procedural pain relief in adults undergoing burn wound care compared to standard care alone or an attention control. Through a comprehensive literature search in various electronic databases 21 eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included, comprising a total of 660 patients. Random effects meta-analyses revealed significant positive treatment effects on pain outcomes, Hedges' g=0.58, 95% CI [0.33; 0.84]. Heterogeneity of study effects was substantial, I(2)=72%. Effects were significantly larger for comparisons against treatment as usual (TAU), g=0.69, CI 95% [0.40; 0.98] than for comparisons against attention control groups, g=0.21 [-0.11; 0.54], p<0.001. Distraction interventions, particularly those using virtual reality, and hypnosis revealed the largest effects on pain relief. Non-pharmacological interventions further resulted in a significant small, homogeneous effect on anxiety reduction, g=0.36 [0.20; 0.52]. In summary, benefits of non-pharmacological interventions on procedural pain relief and reduction of mental distress were demonstrated. Results have been proven to be free of publication bias. However, further high quality trials are needed to strengthen the promising evidence.",0

23553344,Risk factors for beta-amyloid deposition in healthy aging: vascular and genetic effects,"IMPORTANCE: Identifying risk factors for increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition is important for targeting individuals most at risk for developing Alzheimer disease and informing clinical practice concerning prevention and early detection. OBJECTIVE: To investigate risk factors for Abeta deposition in cognitively healthy middle-aged and older adults. Specifically, we hypothesized that individuals with a vascular risk factor such as hypertension, in combination with a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele), would show greater amyloid burden than those without such risk. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eighteen well-screened and cognitively normal adults, aged 47 to 89 years. Participants were classified in the hypertension group if they reported a medical diagnosis of hypertension or if blood pressure exceeded 140 mm Hg systolic/90 mm Hg diastolic, as measured across 7 occasions at the time of study. INTERVENTION: Participants underwent Abeta positron emission tomography imaging with radiotracer fluorine 18-labeled florbetapir. Participants were genotyped for apolipoprotein E and were classified as epsilon4(+) or epsilon4(-). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Amyloid burden. RESULTS: Participants in the hypertension group with at least 1 epsilon4 allele showed significantly greater amyloid burden than those with only 1 risk factor or no risk factors. Furthermore, increased pulse pressure was strongly associated with increased mean cortical amyloid level for subjects with at least 1 epsilon4 allele. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vascular disease is a prevalent age-related condition that is highly responsive to both behavioral modification and medical treatment. Proper control and prevention of risk factors such as hypertension earlier in the life span may be one potential mechanism to ameliorate or delay neuropathological brain changes with aging.",0
16446975,Genetic alterations in caspase-10 may be causative or protective in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome,"Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is characterized by lymphadenopathy, elevated numbers of T cells with alphabeta-T cell receptors but neither CD4 nor CD8 co-receptors, and impaired lymphocyte apoptosis in vitro. Defects in the Fas receptor are the most common cause of ALPS (ALPS Ia), but in rare cases other apoptosis proteins have been implicated, including caspase-10 (ALPS II). We investigated the role of variants of caspase-10 in ALPS. Of 32 unrelated probands with ALPS who did not have Fas defects, two were heterozygous for the caspase-10 missense mutation I406L. Like the previously reported ALPS II-associated mutation L285F, I406L impaired apoptosis when transfected alone and dominantly inhibited apoptosis mediated by wild type caspase-10 in a co-transfection assay. Other variants in caspase-10, V410I and Y446C, were found in 3.4 and 1.6% of chromosomes in Caucasians, and in 0.5 and <0.5% of African Americans, respectively. In contrast to L285F and I406L, these variants had no dominant negative effect in co-transfection assays into the H9 lymphocytic cell line. We found healthy individuals homozygous for V410I, challenging the earlier suggestion that homozygosity for V410I alone causes ALPS. Moreover, an association analysis suggested protection from severe disease by caspase-10 V410I in 63 families with ALPS Ia due to dominant Fas mutations (P<0.05). Thus, different genetic variations in caspase-10 can produce contrasting phenotypic effects.",1
15699383,Genetic association between the APOE*4 allele and Lewy bodies in Alzheimer disease,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between APOE*4 and pathologically confirmed cases of the Lewy body (LB) variant of Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: With use of alpha-synuclein (AS) immunohistochemistry, LBs were detected in 74 of 131 (56.5%) of the AD + LB cases; the remaining 57 cases (43.5%) did not have LBs. RESULTS: There were no differences in gender or age between Caucasian subjects with AD + LB or AD alone or control subjects. The APOE*4 allele frequency was highest in the AD + LB group (47.3%; 95% CI = 37.8 to 57.0%), intermediate in the AD-alone group (35.1%; 95% CI = 25.3 to 46.3%), and lowest in the control group (14.2%; 95% CI = 10.5 to 18.9%). With use of logistic regression analysis, the odds of having AD + LB vs AD alone were 2.1-fold (95% CI = 1.0 to 4.5, p = 0.055) greater in persons with an APOE*4 allele than in those without an APOE*4 allele. CONCLUSION: The APOE*4 allele is associated with the presence of concomitant Lewy bodies in Alzheimer disease.",1
6800349,Plasma apolipoprotein A-1 absence associated with a marked reduction of high density lipoproteins and premature coronary artery disease,"A 45-year-old woman with corneal opacification and severe coronary artery disease was noted to have the following plasma lipid levels (mg/dl, +/- SD): total cholesterol 111 +/- 13, triglyceride 62 +/- 6, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol 4 +/- 1, low density lipoprotein cholesterol 106 +/- 14, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 1 +/- 1 (normal, 50 +/- 14). Her two offspring and one brother were found to have HDL cholesterol values (mg/dl) of 23, 20, and 20, respectively. The percentage of cholesterol in the esterified form in the patient's plasma was normal at 70%. Lipoprotein electrophoresis showed no alpha lipoprotein band, and no HDL was detectable when plasma was subjected to analytic ultracentrifugation. Only trace amounts of lipids were noted within the HDL density region following preparative ultracentrifugation. Mean plasma apolipoprotein (apo) A-ll, apo B, and apo C-ll plasma levels were 13.8%, 130.6% and 26.6% of normal, respectively. The ratio of apo B to cholesterol within LDL was elevated. Apo A-l, the major HDL protein constituent, was immunologically undetectable in this patient's plasma. A decreased HDL cholesterol concentration has been associated with premature coronary artery disease. These data indicate that plasma apo A-l absence results in a striking reduction in HDL, is associated with premature coronary artery disease, and represents a new distinct disease entity.",1
10554268,Oxidation of Free Tryptophan and Tryptophan Residues in Peptides and Proteins,"The oxidation of free tryptophan (Trp) and Trp residues in peptides and proteins by hydrogen peroxide as oxidative agent has been used to evaluate Trp losses and the pattern of degradation products formed. Besides free Trp, four Trp-containing peptides and lysozyme were used as substrates in the aqueous model system. The oxidation rate of Trp and the formation of 16 possible degradation compounds were examined using RP-HPLC and UV, fluorescence, and photodiode array detection. The rate of Trp degradation increased from lysozyme to short-chain peptides to unbound Trp. Only approximately 20% of the total Trp loss could be elucidated by the determined Trp degradation compounds. Oxindolylalanine (Oia), 3a-hydroxy-1,2,3,3a,8,8a-hexahydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indole-2-carboxylic acid (PIC), N-formylkynurenine (NFK), dioxindolylalanine (DiOia), kynurenine (Kyn), and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-OH-Trp) were identified in this order of quantity as degradation compounds, showing the Trp pyrrole moiety to be most susceptible to oxidation. As short peptides such as H-Ala-Trp-Ala-OH were completely hydrolyzed with immobilized Pronase E, Oia and NFK could be identified as main degradation compounds, as could minor amounts of Kyn, DiOia, PIC, and 5-OH-Trp.

Kyn, Oia, and DiOia could be detected in the hydrogen peroxide treated protein.",0
1746562,Regional mapping of the Batten disease locus (CLN3) to human chromosome 16p12,"The gene for Batten disease (CLN3) has been mapped to human chromosome 16 by demonstration of linkage to the haptoglobin locus, and its localization has been further refined using a panel of DNA markers. The aim of this work was to refine the genetic and physical mapping of this disease locus. Genetic linkage analysis was carried out in a larger group of families by using markers for five linked loci. Multipoint analysis indicated a most likely location for CLN3 in the interval between D16S67 and D16S148 (Z = 12.5). Physical mapping of linked markers was carried out using somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization. A mouse/human hybrid cell panel containing various segments of chromosome 16 has been constructed. The relative order and physical location of breakpoints in the proximal portion of 16p were determined. Physical mapping in this panel of the markers for the loci flanking CLN3 positioned them to the bands 16p12.1----16p12.3. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of metaphase chromosomes by using these markers positioned them to the region 16p11.2-16p12.1. These results localize CLN3 to an interval of about 2 cM in the region 16p12.",1

23747014,The proto-oncometabolite fumarate binds glutathione to amplify ROS-dependent signaling,"The tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) has been identified as a tumor suppressor in a subset of human renal cell carcinomas. Human FH-deficient cancer cells display high fumarate concentration and ROS levels along with activation of HIF-1. The underlying mechanisms by which FH loss increases ROS and HIF-1 are not fully understood. Here, we report that glutamine-dependent oxidative citric acid cycle metabolism is required to generate fumarate and increase ROS and HIF-1 levels. Accumulated fumarate directly bonds the antioxidant glutathione in vitro and in vivo to produce the metabolite succinated glutathione (GSF). GSF acts as an alternative substrate to glutathione reductase to decrease NADPH levels and enhance mitochondrial ROS and HIF-1 activation. Increased ROS also correlates with hypermethylation of histones in these cells. Thus, fumarate serves as a proto-oncometabolite by binding to glutathione which results in the accumulation of ROS.",0
29534392,Effect of miR-19b on the proliferation and apoptosis of P19CL6 cells during the late-stage of cardiac differentiation,"Objective: To explore the effect of miR-19b on the function of P19CL6 cells and its molecular mechanism. Methods: Overexpression of miR-19b was carried out by transfecting miR-19b plasmid into the P19CL6 cells. MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to determine cell growth and apoptosis, respectively. Western blot was used to detect the expression level of Sox6 in P19CL6 cells. ELISA assay was used to detect the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes (Bax, Bcl-2) in P19CL6 cells at late-stage cardiac differentiation. Further online software TargetScan was used to predict the target genes of miR-19b and verified by dual luciferase reporter assay. Results: Our data showed that overexpression of miR-19b in P19CL6 cells significantly increased the cell growth rates and the apoptosis inhibition rates. The ratio of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax/Bcl-2) was significantly reduced. Results from the TargetScan and dual luciferase reporter showed that Sox6 is the direct target of miR-19b. Conclusions: We conclude that miR-19b might promote cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis during the late-stage of cardiac differentiation by targeting Sox6 expression.",0

17885259,"Pioglitazone exerts protective effects against stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats, independently of blood pressure","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Very recent subgroup analysis from the PROspective pioglitAzone Clinical Trial In macroVascular Events has shown that pioglitazone reduces the risk of recurrent stroke in type 2 diabetic patients. However, the underlying mechanism of stroke prevention by pioglitazone is unknown. Our aim was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on hypertension-based stroke in rats. METHODS: Pioglitazone (1 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) was orally administered to stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) to examine the effect on incidental stroke, cerebrovascular injury, brain inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular endothelial dysfunction induced by hypertension. RESULTS: Treatment of SHRSP with pioglitazone for 4 weeks, without affecting blood pressure and blood glucose values, improved vascular endothelial dysfunction (P<0.05), suppressed remodeling of the middle cerebral artery (P<0.05) and brain microvessels (P<0.05), and inhibited brain macrophage infiltration (P<0.05) and the upregulation of brain monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression (P<0.01). Furthermore, pioglitazone treatment significantly delayed the onset of stroke signs and death in SHRSP (P<0.05). These beneficial effects of pioglitazone on cerebrovascular injury and stroke in SHRSP were associated with a reduction of brain and vascular superoxide via the inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides the first evidence that pioglitazone significantly protects against hypertension-induced cerebrovascular injury and stroke by improving vascular endothelial dysfunction, inhibiting brain inflammation, and reducing oxidative stress. These beneficial effects of pioglitazone were independent of blood pressure or blood sugar values. Thus, pioglitazone appears to be a potential therapeutic agent for stroke in type 2 diabetes with hypertension.",0

1970154,Transforming genes from familial adenomatous polyposis patient cells detected by a tumorigenicity assay,"We tried to detect oncogenes associated with familial adenomatous polyposis by a tumorigenicity assay in nude mice. One polyp and two peripheral blood lymphocyte DNAs out of 12 samples from patients induced Alu-positive tumors. Lymphocyte DNAs from one of 5 healthy people also showed tumorigenic activity. The transforming genes of polyps from a patient and lymphocytes from a normal person were found to be the human N-ras gene. Since these N-ras genes were amplified in nude mouse tumors and did not show any alterations in the nucleotide sequences around codons 12 and 61, it is likely that the tumors were induced by the amplified normal N-ras genes. The transforming sequences from two patients' lymphocytes did not hybridize with 12 known oncogene probes, suggesting that these two genes are novel oncogenes or genes for which we have not yet examined the homology. One oncogene derived from a patient's lymphocytes was partially cloned and shown to be located on human chromosome 7. This gene did not hybridize with the met and erbB1 genes, which are potential oncogenes located on chromosome 7. These data indicate that this gene is a new oncogene.",1

11437242,Probing the penicillin sidechain selectivity of recombinant deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase,"Deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase from Streptomyces clavuligerus catalyses the conversion of the five-membered penicillin ring to the unsaturated six-membered cephem ring of deacetoxycephalosporin C. The effects on enzyme activity of the penicillin substrate sidechain and various cofactors were investigated using a continuous spectrophotometric assay. The conversion of penicillin G to phenylacetyl-7-aminodeacetoxycephalo sporanic acid (G-7-ADCA) was confirmed, and further details of the reaction were elucidated. The conversion of ampicillin to cephalexin was faster than that of acetyl-6-APA to acetyl-7-ADCA kcat = 0.120 +/- 0.001 s(-1) versus 0.035 +/- 0.001 s(-1), but they had similar Km values: 4.86 +/- 0.12 and 3.28 +/- 0.26 mM, respectively. Amoxycillin and penicillin V were also converted at low levels. Conversion was not detected for penicillanate, 6-aminopenicillanate, carbenicillin, temocillin, ticarcillin or benzylpenicilloic acid, suggesting that the enzyme has a relatively strict selectivity for the sidechain of the penicillin substrate.",0
9261265,Relation of plaque lipid composition and morphology to the stability of human aortic plaques,"The propensity of atherosclerotic plaques to disrupt may be influenced by their lipid content and the distribution of these lipids within the plaque. To investigate this, we analyzed the morphological and lipid profiles of 668 human aortic plaques from 30 males who had died of ischemic heart disease. Plaques were classified as disrupted or as intact types A or B, the latter distinction being based on the absence or presence, respectively, of disrupted plaques within the same aorta. Disrupted plaques have a greater content of lipid (P < .001) and macrophages (P < .001) as well as a thinner cap (P < .001) than intact plaques. Lipid concentrations are positively associated with macrophage accumulation in all plaque types and are negatively associated with minimum cap thickness at the edge of disrupted plaques (P < .05). Free cholesterol concentration is inversely associated with minimum cap thickness at the center of type B plaques only (P < .05). At the center of intact type A and B and disrupted plaques, the free-to-esterified cholesterol ratios were 0.9 (range, 0.0 to 2.7), 0.8 (0.0 to 3.9), and 1.6 (0.2 to 4.0), respectively. Esterified cholesterol concentrations were higher at the center of type B plaques, and those of free cholesterol were higher at the center of disrupted plaques. At the edge of disrupted plaques, the free-to-esterified cholesterol ratio was 0.5 (0.0 to 2.7) because of the accumulation of esterified cholesterol. Concentrations of all fatty acids were increased at the edge of disrupted plaques compared with the center, but as a proportion of total fatty acids, omega 6-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were lower (44% versus 46%, P < .01), possibly reflecting oxidation of PUFAs. These data demonstrate differences in lipid composition and intraplaque lipid distribution between intact and disrupted plaques. At the edge of advanced plaques, increased esterified lipid concentrations, inversely associated with cap thickness, may reflect macrophage activity and a predisposition to rupture.",0
11551958,"Biosynthesis of the linkage region of glycosaminoglycans: cloning and activity of galactosyltransferase II, the sixth member of the beta 1,3-galactosyltransferase family (beta 3GalT6)","A family of five beta1,3-galactosyltransferases has been characterized that catalyze the formation of Galbeta1,3GlcNAcbeta and Galbeta1,3GalNAcbeta linkages present in glycoproteins and glycolipids (beta3GalT1, -2, -3, -4, and -5). We now report a new member of the family (beta3GalT6), involved in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. The human and mouse genes were located on chromosomes 1p36.3 and 4E2, respectively, and homologs are found in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Unlike other members of the family, beta3GalT6 showed a broad mRNA expression pattern by Northern blot analysis. Although a high degree of homology across several subdomains exists among other members of the beta3-galactosyltransferase family, recombinant enzyme did not utilize glucosamine- or galactosamine-containing acceptors. Instead, the enzyme transferred galactose from UDP-galactose to acceptors containing a terminal beta-linked galactose residue. This product, Galbeta1,3Galbeta is found in the linkage region of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (GlcAbeta1,3Galbeta1,3Galbeta1,4Xylbeta-O-Ser), indicating that beta3GalT6 is the so-called galactosyltransferase II involved in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. Its identity was confirmed in vivo by siRNA-mediated inhibition of glycosaminoglycan synthesis in HeLa S3 cells. Its localization in the medial Golgi indicates that this is the major site for assembly of the linkage region.",1

It is generally small and is in relation to the interatrial septum, often mistaken as cardiac myxoma. A 19-year-old girl, on evaluation of respiratory infection, was found to have a mass compressing the right atrium. Computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging suggested a differential diagnosis of pericardial cyst or hydatid cyst. Peroperatively, a large (8 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm) cystic lesion in relation to the right atrial free wall was found. The histopathology of the resected mass revealed it to be a cardiac varix. The case is notable for its large size and its location in relation to the right atrial free wall.",0
1400357,Gene expression of mouse choline acetyltransferase. Alternative splicing and identification of a highly active promoter region,"Seven types of mRNA for choline acetyltransferase that differ in the 5'-noncoding region were identified in the mouse spinal cord by cDNA cloning and polymerase chain reaction. Among these transcripts, the M-type mRNA corresponding to the previously cloned mouse cDNA was most abundant in the spinal cord of mouse. A mouse genomic DNA clone containing the 5'-region of choline acetyltransferase mRNA was isolated and sequenced. Comparison of the sequences between the cDNAs and the genomic DNA revealed that the different mRNA species were transcribed from different promoter regions and produced by differential splicing. Two murine cholinergic cell lines, NS20Y and NG108-15, were shown to express the M-type mRNA almost exclusively, and were therefore used to study transcription of M-type mRNA. Fragments of the 5'-region of choline acetyltransferase gene were ligated with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and introduced into cultured cells. The fragment from -2752 to +46, which contained the M-type exon, a TATA-box like element upstream of the M-type exon, and the downstream intron, induced a significant expression of CAT activity in neuronal but not in non-neuronal cell lines. This result indicates that this region of choline acetyltransferase gene contains elements that regulate neuron-specific expression of choline acetyltransferase activity. However, there was no parallel correlation between reporter gene expression in the transfected cells and intrinsic choline acetyltransferase activity in these neuronal cell lines. Possible mechanisms that would explain this observation are discussed.",1
8530027,"Isolation, characterization, and precise physical localization of human CDX1, a caudal-type homeobox gene","The human CDX1 gene has been isolated from a small intestine cDNA library using a murine Cdx1 cDNA probe. The nucleotide sequence of CDX1 is 81% identical to murine Cdx1 and predicts a 265-amino-acid protein with 85% identity to the mouse protein (98% identity, including conservative amino acid changes). The CDX1 locus has been mapped to a cosmid contig from chromosome 5q31-q33, placing CDX1 approximately 100 kb distal to CSFIR. Expression of CDX1 in adults appears to be limited to the intestine and colon by Northern analysis, suggesting a possible role in the terminal differentiation of the intestine. Further analysis of CDX1 should elucidate the function of caudal-type homeobox genes in human development.",1
20519437,Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease epithelial cell model reveals multiple basolateral epidermal growth factor receptor sorting pathways,"Sorting and maintenance of the EGF receptor on the basolateral surface of renal epithelial cells is perturbed in polycystic kidney disease and apical expression of receptors contributes to severity of disease. The goal of these studies was to understand the molecular basis for EGF receptor missorting using a well-established mouse model for the autosomal recessive form of the disease. We have discovered that multiple basolateral pathways mediate EGF receptor sorting in renal epithelial cells. The polycystic kidney disease allele in this model, Bicc1, interferes with one specific EGF receptor pathway without affecting overall cell polarity. Furthermore one of the pathways is regulated by a latent basolateral sorting signal that restores EGF receptor polarity in cystic renal epithelial cells via passage through a Rab11-positive subapical compartment. These studies give new insights to possible therapies to reconstitute EGF receptor polarity and function in order to curb disease progression. They also indicate for the first time that the Bicc1 gene that is defective in the mouse model used in these studies regulates cargo-specific protein sorting mediated by the epithelial cell specific clathrin adaptor AP-1B.",1
23913330,Differentiation of thrombus from pannus as the cause of acquired mechanical prosthetic heart valve obstruction by non-invasive imaging: a review of the literature,"AIMS: For acquired mechanical prosthetic heart valve (PHV) obstruction and suspicion on thrombosis, recently updated European Society of Cardiology guidelines advocate the confirmation of thrombus by transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and fluoroscopy. However, no evidence-based diagnostic algorithm is available for correct thrombus detection, although this is clinically important as fibrinolysis is contraindicated in non-thrombotic obstruction (isolated pannus). Here, we performed a review of the literature in order to propose a diagnostic algorithm. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic search in Pubmed and Embase. Included publications were assessed on methodological quality based on the validated Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) II checklist. Studies were scarce (n = 15) and the majority were of moderate methodological quality. In total, 238 mechanical PHV's with acquired obstruction and a reliable reference standard were included for the evaluation of the role of fluoroscopy, echocardiography, or multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT). In acquired PHV obstruction caused by thrombosis, mass detection by TEE and leaflet restriction detected by fluoroscopy were observed in the majority of cases (96 and 100%, respectively). In contrast, in acquired PHV obstruction free of thrombosis (pannus), leaflet restriction detected by fluoroscopy was absent in some cases (17%) and mass detection by TEE was absent in the majority of cases (66%). In case of mass detection by TEE, predictors for obstructive thrombus masses (compared with pannus masses) were leaflet restriction, soft echo density, and increased mass length. In situations of inconclusive echocardiography, MDCT may correctly detect pannus/thrombus based on the morphological aspects and localization. CONCLUSION: In acquired mechanical PHV obstruction without leaflet restriction and absent mass on TEE, obstructive PHV thrombosis cannot be confirmed and consequently, fibrinolysis is not advised. Based on the literature search and our opinion, a diagnostic algorithm is provided to correctly identify non-thrombotic PHV obstruction, which is highly relevant in daily clinical practice.",0
2620658,Comparison of the effect of amiodarone and benziodarone on thyroxine metabolism and surface ECG,"This study examined whether or not the electrophysiological effect of amiodarone on the heart is mediated through its action on thyroxine metabolism. Serum thyroid hormones and ECG were evaluated before and serially during amiodarone (15 subjects) and benziodarone (15 subjects) administration. Both amiodarone and benziodarone shifted the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (P less than 0.001 for amiodarone and P less than 0.001 for benziodarone) towards reverse triiodothyronine and away from triiodothyronine, whilst TSH levels initially fell and then rose with both drugs. After amiodarone the heart rate decreased (P less than 0.025), whilst the PR (P less than 0.005) and the QT interval (P less than 0.005) corrected for the heart rate increased. By contrast with benziodarone only the PR interval decreased (P less than 0.05). Since both drugs had roughly similar effects on thyroid hormone metabolism but different ones on the ECG, our results provide indirect evidence against the hypothesis that the antiarrhythmic effects of amiodarone are mediated through a decrease in the serum T3 presented to the peripheral tissues.",0
1385112,The multidrug resistance and cystic fibrosis genes have complementary patterns of epithelial expression,"The cystic fibrosis gene product, CFTR, and the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (encoded by the MDR1 gene) are structurally related proteins and both are associated with epithelial chloride channel activities. We have compared their cell-specific expression in the rat by in situ hybridization. In all tissues examined the two genes were found to have complementary patterns of expression, demonstrating exquisite regulation in both cell-specific and temporal fashions. Additionally, a switch in expression from one gene to the other was observed in certain tissues. For example, expression in the intestine switches from CFTR to MDR1 as the cells migrate across the crypt-villus boundary. A switch from CFTR to MDR1 expression was also observed in the uterine epithelium upon pregnancy. These data suggest that CFTR and P-glycoprotein serve analogous roles in epithelial cells and provide additional evidence that P-glycoprotein has a physiological role in regulating epithelial cell volume. The patterns of expression suggest that the regulation of these two genes is coordinately controlled.",1

30467780,Validation of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-57 and -29 item short forms among kidney transplant recipients,"OBJECTIVE: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) aims to address the lack of generalizable and universal measure of patient-reported outcomes to assess health-related quality of life. It has not been validated for patients with chronic kidney disease. We aim to validate the PROMIS-57 and PROMIS-29 questionnaires among kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of stable kidney transplant recipients was recruited. Each participant completed PROMIS-57, a 57-question instrument covering seven domains-physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, and social functioning-alongside validated legacy questionnaires [Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), General Anxiety Disorder (GAD7), Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale revised (ESASr), and Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQoL-36)]. PROMIS-29, a 29-question instrument, is nested within PROMIS-57 and measures the same domains. Structural validity of PROMIS was assessed with confirmatory factor analysis, reported using the Comparative Fit Index (CFI). Construct validity was assessed with known-groups comparisons. Internal consistency was evaluated with Cronbach's alpha and convergent validity was assessed with Spearman's Rho. Test-retest reliability was assessed through the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: Mean (+/- SD) age of the 177 participants was 50 (+/- 17), 57% were male and 55% Caucasian. Internal consistency of each domain was high (Cronbach's alpha > 0.88). Confirmatory factor analysis showed good structural validity for most domains (CFI > 0.95, RMSEA < 0.05). Test-retest reliability indicated good agreement (ICC > 0.6). Known-groups comparisons by clinical and socio-demographic differences were found as hypothesized. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that PROMIS-57 and PROMIS-29 are highly reliable and valid instruments among kidney transplant recipients. We propose it as a valuable tool to assess important domains of the illness experience.",0
2899317,Receptor mediation of the discriminative stimulus properties of phencyclidine and sigma-opioid agonists,"Evidence has accumulated that the discriminative stimulus effects of phencyclidine (PCP) may be transduced by a specific receptor in mammalian brain. Two major lines of evidence support this hypothesis. One is the structure-activity correlation that arylcyclohexylamine analogs of PCP have for PCP-like discriminative effects and displacement of [3H]PCP binding. The other, even stronger, evidence is that representatives of some nonarylcyclohexylamine classes of drugs are both generalized from PCP and have activity at PCP-binding sites. These include the psychotomimetic sigma-agonist opioids such as (+)-N-allylnormetazocine (NANM), the 1,3-substituted dioxolanes dexoxadrol and etoxadrol and some benz(f)isoquinolines. Early evidence suggested that there may be a complete overlap in the discriminative effects and receptor systems for PCP and sigma-agonists, and there continues to be evidence to support the commonality of these drug groups. On the other hand, binding studies with radiolabeled sigma agonists have revealed a non-PCP site. The role of this site in the behavioral actions of sigma-agonists is at present unknown. PCP analogs and other PCP-like drugs also can function as reinforcers for self-administration behavior, suggesting that the same cellular mechanisms may be responsible for both discriminative and reinforcing stimulus effects of these drugs. PCP has been shown to block many of the in vitro and in vivo effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), a putative specific agonist for a subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor. Recent evidence that NMDA antagonists are generalized from PCP in rats and pigeons provides evidence that modification of excitatory amino neurotransmission may be a physiological function of the PCP receptor and that this receptor complex may be involved in PCP's discriminative stimulus effects.",0
16539088,Assessing diagnostic accuracy and the clinical value of positron emission tomography imaging in patients with solitary pulmonary nodules (SNAP),"BACKGROUND: Diagnostic tests, particularly diagnostic imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET), have the potential to make important contributions to improved patient care and medical decision making. The expense of these tests is justified to the extent that they improve diagnostic and treatment decisions, and ultimately health outcomes. Clinical studies evaluating the accuracy of diagnostic tests and assessing their influence on decision making are essential to setting health policy and directing patient care. PURPOSE: We present the design and participant baseline characteristics of the Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study 027 (Prospective Study of the Diagnostic Accuracy of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) - Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging in the Management of Patients with Solitary Pulmonary Nodules (SNAP). METHODS: SNAP is a prospective, multi-site diagnostic trial to evaluate the efficacy of PET and CT for characterizing solitary pulmonary nodules. The study incorporated an assessment of the impact of these imaging modalities on clinical decision making. RESULTS: Between January 1999 and June 2001, 10 SNAP sites enrolled 532 participants with a mean age of 66 years (SD +/- 11.3), of whom 97.3% were male. A history of smoking was claimed by 93.6% of participants, with 45.7% of all participants smoking at time of enrollment. Those still smoking had an average exposure of 56.8 pack-years, while those who had quit smoking prior to enrollment had an exposure of 58.1 pack-years. LIMITATIONS: The study design reduced most common biases, but some degree of selection bias and verification bias remained. We sought to minimize verification bias by use of a dual reference standard. CONCLUSION: SNAP is a diagnostic test study that was designed to minimize bias and to assess a test's impact on clinical decision making, providing the kind of information most needed by clinicians and health policy makers.",0
16020694,Drosophila RNAi screen reveals CD36 family member required for mycobacterial infection,"Certain pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, survive within the hostile intracellular environment of a macrophage. To identify host factors required for mycobacterial entry and survival within macrophages, we performed a genomewide RNA interference screen in Drosophila macrophage-like cells, using Mycobacterium fortuitum. We identified factors required for general phagocytosis, as well as those needed specifically for mycobacterial infection. One specific factor, Peste (Pes), is a CD36 family member required for uptake of mycobacteria, but not Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, mammalian class B scavenger receptors (SRs) conferred uptake of bacteria into nonphagocytic cells, with SR-BI and SR-BII uniquely mediating uptake of M. fortuitum, which suggests a conserved role for class B SRs in pattern recognition and innate immunity.",1
19557351,"Nup211, the fission yeast homolog of Mlp1/Tpr, is involved in mRNA export","Synthetic lethal mutants have been previously isolated in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which genetically interact with spmex67, in order to identify the genes involved in mRNA export. The nup211 gene was isolated by complementation of the growth defect in one of the synthetic lethal mutants, SLMex2, under synthetic lethal condition. We showed that Nup211, fission yeast homolog of Mlpl/Mlp2/Tpr, is essential for vegetative growth and Nup211-GFP proteins expressed at endogenous level are localized mainly in nuclear periphery. The accumulation of poly(A)(+) RNA in the nucleus is exhibited when expression of nup211 is repressed or over-expressed. These results suggest that the Nup211 protein plays a pivotal role of mRNA export in fission yeast.",0

17244528,"Control of macroautophagy by calcium, calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase-beta, and Bcl-2","Macroautophagy is an evolutionary conserved lysosomal pathway involved in the turnover of cellular macromolecules and organelles. In spite of its essential role in tissue homeostasis, the molecular mechanisms regulating mammalian macroautophagy are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that a rise in the free cytosolic calcium ([Ca(2+)](c)) is a potent inducer of macroautophagy. Various Ca(2+) mobilizing agents (vitamin D(3) compounds, ionomycin, ATP, and thapsigargin) inhibit the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin, a negative regulator of macroautophagy, and induce massive accumulation of autophagosomes in a Beclin 1- and Atg7-dependent manner. This process is mediated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase-beta and AMP-activated protein kinase and inhibited by ectopic Bcl-2 located in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), where it lowers the [Ca(2+)](ER) and attenuates agonist-induced Ca(2+) fluxes. Thus, an increase in the [Ca(2+)](c) serves as a potent inducer of macroautophagy and as a target for the antiautophagy action of ER-located Bcl-2.",1

The initial enzymatic step in the formation of leukotrienes is the oxidation of arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) to leukotriene A4. Osteosarcoma cells transfected with 5-LO express active enzyme in broken cell preparations, but no leukotriene metabolites are produced by these cells when stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187, indicating that an additional component is necessary for cellular 5-LO activity. A new class of indole leukotriene inhibitor has been described that inhibits the formation of cellular leukotrienes but has no direct inhibitory effect on soluble 5-LO activity. We have now used these potent agents to identify and isolate a novel membrane protein of relative molecular mass 18,000 which is necessary for cellular leukotriene synthesis.",1

11504413,Chronic invasive aspergillosis of the paranasal sinuses in immunocompetent hosts from Saudi Arabia,"In immunocompetent patients, paranasal invasive aspergillosis is rare and has a high recurrence rate. Twenty-three cases of paranasal invasive aspergillosis, involving 14 male and nine female immunocompetent patients were reviewed. All patients were cancer-free, HIV-negative, with normal WBC, and none of the patients had received immunosuppressive therapy or corticosteroids. Mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 18 months. Aspergillus flavus was the species most frequently isolated. Surgical debridement was performed in all patients followed by antifungal therapy in 18 patients. Mean follow-up duration was 30 months. Fourteen patients relapsed after a mean of 13 months and required an average of 4.3 admissions for repeat surgical evacuation. In a logistic regression model, relapse was not associated with age, duration of symptoms, clinical findings, extent of disease, or mode of therapy. However, patients who were relapse-free tended to have had complete surgical evacuation followed by antifungal therapy.",0

29715819,Tunable dual-band graphene-based infrared reflectance filter,"We experimentally demonstrated an actively tunable optical filter that controls the amplitude of reflected long-wave-infrared light in two separate spectral regions concurrently. Our device exploits the dependence of the excitation energy of plasmons in a continuous and unpatterned sheet of graphene on the Fermi-level, which can be controlled via conventional electrostatic gating. The filter enables simultaneous modification of two distinct spectral bands whose positions are dictated by the device geometry and graphene plasmon dispersion. Within these bands, the reflected amplitude can be varied by over 15% and resonance positions can be shifted by over 90 cm(-1). Electromagnetic simulations verify that tuning arises through coupling of incident light to graphene plasmons by a grating structure. Importantly, the tunable range is determined by a combination of graphene properties, device structure, and the surrounding dielectrics, which dictate the plasmon dispersion. Thus, the underlying design shown here is applicable across a broad range of infrared frequencies.",0
23968056,Passive acoustic monitoring using a towed hydrophone array results in identification of a previously unknown beaked whale habitat,"Beaked whales are diverse and species rich taxa. They spend the vast majority of their time submerged, regularly diving to depths of hundreds to thousands of meters, typically occur in small groups, and behave inconspicuously at the surface. These factors make them extremely difficult to detect using standard visual survey methods. However, recent advancements in acoustic detection capabilities have made passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) a viable alternative. Beaked whales can be discriminated from other odontocetes by the unique characteristics of their echolocation clicks. In 2009 and 2010, PAM methods using towed hydrophone arrays were tested. These methods proved highly effective for real-time detection of beaked whales in the Southern California Bight (SCB) and were subsequently implemented in 2011 to successfully detect and track beaked whales during the ongoing Southern California Behavioral Response Study. The three year field effort has resulted in (1) the successful classification and tracking of Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris), Baird's (Berardius bairdii), and unidentified Mesoplodon beaked whale species and (2) the identification of areas of previously unknown beaked whale habitat use. Identification of habitat use areas will contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between beaked whale distribution, occurrence, and preferred habitat characteristics on a relatively small spatial scale. These findings will also provide information that can be used to promote more effective management and conservation of beaked whales in the SCB, a heavily used Naval operation and training region.

30055160,Oligodendrocytic but not neuronal Nogo restricts corticospinal axon sprouting after CNS injury,"Recovery from injury to the central nervous system (CNS) is limited in the mammalian adult. Nonetheless, some degree of spontaneous recovery occurs after partial CNS injury. Compensatory axonal growth from uninjured neurons, termed sprouting, contributes to this naturally occurring recovery process and can be modulated by molecular intervention. Extensive studies have depicted a long-held hypothesis that oligodendrocyte-derived Nogo restricts axonal sprouting and functional recovery after CNS injury. However, cell type-specific function of Nogo in compensatory sprouting, spinal axon repair or functional recovery after CNS injury has not been reported. Here we present data showing that inducible, cell type-specific deletion of Nogo from oligodendrocytes led to a ~50% increase in the compensatory sprouting of corticospinal tract (CST) axons in the cervical spinal cord after unilateral pyramidotomy in mice. In contrast to a previously proposed growth-promoting role of neuronal Nogo in the optic nerve, deleting neuronal Nogo did not significantly affect CST axon sprouting in the spinal cord. Sprouting axons were associated with the expression of synaptic marker VGLUT1 in both the oligodendrocytic Nogo deletion and control mice. However, we did not detect any functional improvement in fine motor control associated with the increased sprouting in oligodendrocytic Nogo deletion mice. These data show for the first time with genetic evidence that Nogo specifically expressed by oligodendrocytes restricts compensatory sprouting after CNS injury, supporting a longstanding but heretofore untested hypothesis. While implicating a focus on sprouting as a repair mechanism in the translational potential of targeting the myelin inhibitory pathway, our study illustrates the challenge to harness enhanced structural plasticity for functional improvement.",0
19713527,The E3 ligase TRAF6 regulates Akt ubiquitination and activation,"Akt signaling plays a central role in many biological functions, such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. Because Akt (also known as protein kinase B) resides primarily in the cytosol, it is not known how these signaling molecules are recruited to the plasma membrane and subsequently activated by growth factor stimuli. We found that the protein kinase Akt undergoes lysine-63 chain ubiquitination, which is important for Akt membrane localization and phosphorylation. TRAF6 was found to be a direct E3 ligase for Akt and was essential for Akt ubiquitination, membrane recruitment, and phosphorylation upon growth-factor stimulation. The human cancer-associated Akt mutant displayed an increase in Akt ubiquitination, in turn contributing to the enhancement of Akt membrane localization and phosphorylation. Thus, Akt ubiquitination is an important step for oncogenic Akt activation.",1

7923172,"Human cytidine deaminase: purification of enzyme, cloning, and expression of its complementary DNA","Cytidine (CR) deaminase was purified 47,000-fold to homogeneity from human placenta. The molecular mass of CR deaminase was estimated to be 48.7 kDa by gel filtration and 16.1 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that it contains three or four identical subunits. We determined the amino acid sequence of several peptide fragments and designed 5'-primers to amplify, by the polymerase chain reaction, a specific 364-base pair DNA fragment using human liver complementary DNA (cDNA) as the template. This DNA fragment, which contains the codons of one peptide, was used as a probe to screen a cDNA library from human liver. We isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone of 910 base pairs that contained a 5' nontranslated region, a 438-base pair coding region, and a 3' nontranslated region with a polyadenylated tail. The translated region of the clone contained a deduced sequence of 146 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 16.2 kDa and the sequences of our peptides. The cDNA was ligated in pGEX vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein had a high CR deaminase activity and molecular mass of 16.3 kDa. These data demonstrate clearly that the open reading frame of our cDNA clone codes for a functional human CR deaminase. Polymerase chain reaction amplifications of gene-specific DNA fragments from human/rodent hybrid cells indicate the localization of CR deaminase gene to human chromosome 1. The cDNA for CR deaminase will be a useful molecular probe to investigate the importance of this enzyme in chemotherapy.",1

In addition to its longevity, naked mole-rats have an extraordinary resistance to cancer as tumors have never been observed in these rodents. Furthermore, we show that a combination of activated Ras and SV40 LT fails to induce robust anchorage-independent growth in naked mole-rat cells, while it readily transforms mouse fibroblasts. The mechanisms responsible for the cancer resistance of naked mole-rats were unknown. Here we show that naked mole-rat fibroblasts display hypersensitivity to contact inhibition, a phenomenon we termed ",0
476969,Non-protein-bound oestrogens in plasma and urinary excretion of unconjugated oestrogens in men,"Unconjugated oestrone and unconjugated oestradiol-17 beta were measured in 24 h urine specimens from twenty normal men. The concentrations of non-protein-bound oestrone and non-protein-bound oestradiol-17 beta, in samples of blood obtained from these subjects during the time in which the urine was collected, were measured by equilibrium dialysis (using a correction for plasma dilution). The mean excretion of unconjugated oestrone (0.44+/- 0.36 nmol/24 h, mean +/- SD) was significantly greater (Pless than 0.01) than that of unconjugated oestradiol-17 beta (0.20 +/- 0.13 nmol/24 h). The concentrations of non-protein-bound oestrone and non-protein-bound oestradiol-17 beta in plasma were 5.52 +/- 2.69pmol/1 and 2.42 +/- 0.73 pmol/1, respectively. There was no correlation between the quantity of unconjugated oestrone excreted and the concentration of non-protein-bound oestrone in plasma (r=0.27) nor between the quantity of unconjugated oestradiol-17 beta in the urine and the concentration of non-protein-bound oestradiol-17 beta in plasma (r=0.05). Therefore in normal men, estimation of unconjugated oestrone or oestradiol-17 beta in urine provides no guide to the concentration of the corresponding non-protein-bound oestrogen in plasma.",0
6340187,The anti-arrhythmia drug quinidine as an alternative in the treatment of severe falciparum malaria,"Parenteral quinine is the most effective treatment for severe falciparum malaria. It is not easily available in Switzerland and so dangerous delays treating patients may occur. The antiarrhythmic drug quinidine, usually stocked by hospitals, is an alternative drug for malaria treatment. We report the cases of two patients with severe malaria imported from Kenya. They were treated first with intravenous quinidine sulfate over 3 days and for another 4 days with peroral quinidine sulfate. The therapeutic response was excellent. During the 2 months posttherapeutic period no recrudescence of Plasmodium falciparum occurred. 20 mg/kg b.w./die of quinidine given intravenously seems to be an adequate dose in severe falciparum malaria.",0
24898443,Biphasic investigation of contact mechanics in natural human hips during activities,"The aim of this study was to determine the cartilage contact mechanics and the associated fluid pressurisation of the hip joint under eight daily activities, using a three-dimensional finite element hip model with biphasic cartilage layers and generic geometries. Loads with spatial and temporal variations were applied over time and the time-dependent performance of the hip cartilage during walking was also evaluated. It was found that the fluid support ratio was over 90% during the majority of the cycles for all the eight activities. A reduced fluid support ratio was observed for the time at which the contact region slid towards the interior edge of the acetabular cartilage, but these occurred when the absolute level of the peak contact stress was minimal. Over 10 cycles of gait, the peak contact stress and peak fluid pressure remained constant, but a faster process of fluid exudation was observed for the interior edge region of the acetabular cartilage. The results demonstrate the excellent function of the hip cartilage within which the solid matrix is prevented from high levels of stress during activities owing to the load shared by fluid pressurisation. The findings are important in gaining a better understanding of the hip function during daily activities, as well as the pathology of hip degeneration and potential for future interventions. They provide a basis for future subject-specific biphasic investigations of hip performance during activities.",0
11919194,"Colocalization, physical, and functional interaction between Werner and Bloom syndrome proteins","The RecQ helicase family comprises a conserved group of proteins implicated in several aspects of DNA metabolism. Three of the family members are defective in heritable diseases characterized by abnormal growth, premature aging, and predisposition to malignancies. These include the WRN and BLM gene products that are defective in Werner and Bloom syndromes, disorders which share many phenotypic and cellular characteristics including spontaneous genomic instability. Here, we report a physical and functional interaction between BLM and WRN. These proteins were coimmunoprecipitated from a nuclear matrix-solubilized fraction, and the purified recombinant proteins were shown to interact directly. Moreover, BLM and WRN colocalized to nuclear foci in three human cell lines. Two regions of WRN that mediate interaction with BLM were identified, and one of these was localized to the exonuclease domain of WRN. Functionally, BLM inhibited the exonuclease activity of WRN. This is the first demonstration of a physical and functional interaction between RecQ helicases. Our observation that RecQ family members interact provides new insights into the complex phenotypic manifestations resulting from the loss of these proteins.",1
9920363,Diagnostic value of technetium-99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) scintigraphy in detecting thyroid cancer metastases: a critical evaluation,"Technetium-99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) scintigraphy has recently been used in clinical application for detecting thyroid cancer metastases, its role being considered supplementary to serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements and radioactive iodine (131I) whole-body scans (WBS). The present retrospective study was designed to elucidate the role of 99mTc-MIBI scans in localizing metastatic lesions by assessing sensitivity and specificity of the scan results obtained in a group of 68 thyroidectomized thyroid cancer patients. Presence or absence of thyroid cancer was judged with other diagnostic modes including serum Tg measurements, 131I WBS, bone scans, chest x-rays, computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography, histopathology, and evolution of disease during follow-up. All scans were read on lesion basis for detecting neck, lung, and bone metastases and also on region basis, namely head-neck, chest, and abdomen-pelvis-extremities (ab-p-ex) areas. The sensitivity of detection was 94.4% (17/18) for neck, 78.4% (40/51) for lung, and 92.8% (64/69) for skeletal lesions. Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 96.3% (26/27) and 97.7% (43/44) for head-neck; 94.7% (71/75) and 50.0% (12/24) for chest; 100.0% (25/25) and 93.1% (54/58) for ab-p-ex regions, respectively. For all scan sites taken together, PPV and NPV were 96.1% (122/127) and 86.5% (109/126), respectively. In conclusion, the present study reveals that 99mTc-MIBI can be proposed as a first-line diagnostic agent for the follow-up protocol of thyroid cancer patients, although the ability to detect small lung metastases is somewhat limited.",0
22553959,Vaccine potential of cytosolic proteins loaded fibrin microspheres of Cryptococcus neoformans in BALB/c mice,"Cryptococcosis is a leading mycological cause of mortality among immunologically compromised individuals. In order to develop an effective vaccine against Cryptococcus neoformans, the cytosolic proteins (Cp) of the pathogen have been used as an antigen in combination with different formulations. In the present study, we have demonstrated that Cp encapsulated poly-lactide co-glycolide (PLGA) microsphere further co-encapsulated into the biocompatible fibrin cross-linked plasma beads (Fib-PLGA-Cp) mediated cytosolic delivery elicited strong immune response in the BALB/c mice. In contrast, other formulations of Cp failed to impart significant level of protection. The immune response, involved with Fib-PLGA-Cp protection, appear to interact with the target cells by both endocytosis as well as membrane fusion mode, thus helping in the activation of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells. Analysis of cytokine profiles in immunized animals revealed that the protective response was associated with the Th1/Th2 polarization in favor of type-1 cytokine [interferons (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-2] cells. Furthermore, vaccination with Fib-PLGA-Cp elicited high immunoglobulin (Ig) G(l) and IgG(2a) isotype response; successfully cleared fungal burden in vital organs and also increased the survival rate of immunized animals. Altogether the present study is a clear indicative of the possible use of fibrin microsphere-based targeted delivery of cytosolic proteins to induce protective immune responses against experimental murine cryptococcosis.",0
10362357,cbl-3: a new mammalian cbl family protein,"We have cloned a new human gene, cbl-3, which encodes a protein with marked homology to the cbl family of proteins. The predicted protein encoded by this gene retains the conserved phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB) in the N-terminal and the zinc finger but is significantly shorter (MW 52.5 kDa) than the other mammalian cbl proteins. The protein lacks the extensive proline rich domain and leucine zipper seen in c-cbl and cbl-b and structurally most resembles the C. elegans and Drosophila cbl proteins. The gene is ubiquitously expressed with highest expression in the aerodigestive tract, prostate, adrenal gland, and salivary gland. The protein is phosphorylated and recruited to the EGFR upon EGF stimulation and inhibits EGF stimulated MAP kinase activation. In comparison to the other mammalian cbl proteins (e.g. cbl-b), cbl-3 interacts with a restricted range of proteins containing Src Homology 3 regions. An alternatively spliced form of the cbl-3 protein was also identified which deletes a critical region of the PTB domain and which does not interact with the EGFR nor inhibit EGF stimulated MAP kinase activation. These data demonstrate that cbl-3, a novel mammalian cbl protein, is a regulator of EGFR mediated signal transduction.",1
29982713,Genetic Characterization of Toxoplasma gondii DNA Samples Isolated From Humans Living in North America: An Unexpected High Prevalence of Atypical Genotypes,"Background: Whereas in Europe most of Toxoplasma gondii genotypes belong to the type II lineage, in Latin America, type II is rare and atypical strains predominate. In North America, data on T. gondii genotypes in humans are scarce. Methods: In this study, T. gondii DNA samples from 67 patients with diagnosed toxoplasmosis in the United States were available for genotyping. Discriminant analysis of principal components was used to infer each atypical genotype to a geographic area where patients were probably infected. Associations between genotype, disease severity, immune status, and geographic region were also estimated. Results: Of 67 DNA samples, 41 were successfully genotyped: 18 (43.9%) and 5 (12.2%) were characterized as types II and III, respectively. The remaining 18 genotypes (43.9%) were atypical and were assigned to a geographic area. Ten genotypes originated from Latin America, 7 from North America, and 1 from Asia (China). In North America, unlike in Europe, T. gondii atypical genotypes are common in humans and, unlike in Latin America, type II strains are still present with significant frequency. Conclusions: Clinicians should be aware that atypical genotypes are common in North America and have been associated with severe ocular and systemic disease and unusual presentations of toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent patients.",0
12237497,Return to work after spinal cord injury: a review of recent research,"This manuscript reviews recent research on return to work (RTW) for individuals who sustain spinal cord injury (SCI), including the effects of demographics variables, occupational characteristics, workplace accommodations, quality of life, physical functional limitations, and other variable. Demographic variables that influence RTW for persons with SCI include age at injury onset, chronological age, gender, education, ethnicity, marital status, and per-injury work intensity. Others include satisfaction, and adjustment to sustaining SCI. In an effort to enhance employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities including SCI, Ticket to Work Incentive Improvement Act of 1999 (TWILA) has been passed by Congress and some states have begun implementing targeted initiatives through the State Partnership Systems Change Initiatives (SPI).

24021176,Debate on the advantages and disadvantages of multifocal and monofocal intraocular lens,"Phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation is the most effective treatment of cataract.Traditional intraocular lens were mainly monofocal. Postoperative patients can return to a certain distance vision or near vision, but because of the loss of accommodative power, patients must rely on glasses to complete the work of the different distances, the postoperative life there is still a lot of inconvenience. In recent years, the design of multifocal intraocular lens has been the focus of basic and applied research in cataract, but so far the researchers still could not have agreement with the strengths and weaknesses of the multifocal and monofocal intraocular lens. There are three major controversies: First of all, whether it is worth the expense of contrast sensitivity and increased visual disturbance in return for compensatory adjustment? Second, whether it is possible to really get the full range of vision and to get rid of dependence on glasses to use multifocal intraocular lens? Third, how to grasp the indications of multifocal intraocular lens to play to their strengths. ",0
22683064,Postponing elective hospitalizations for pre-admission MRSA screening and decolonization. A study evaluating eligibility and acceptance among patients of a German university hospital,"There is evidence that pre-admission screening and decolonization (PreASD) of MRSA can reduce costs in elective surgical patients. It is not known whether this strategy could also be successfully applied to general medical patients of a tertiary referral hospital with multiple specialties. Our study retrospectively evaluates the eligibility of patients for MRSA-PreASD in a setting of active targeted MRSA surveillance. We carried out a survey among eligible patients to assess acceptance and feasibility of MRSA-PreASD. Of 10,496 admissions to our university hospital 8912 (84.9%) were screened for MRSA-risk factors. In 5382 admissions at risk swabs were taken and analyzed. Using the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP) we retrospectively assessed how many of the 5382 admissions at risk could have been postponed for the duration of an MRSA-PreASD. 36 (17%) of 212 admissions with proven MRSA colonization and 2175 (42%) of 5170 patients without detectable MRSA could have been sent home for MRSA-PreASD to be electively admitted later. Of the 36 admissions (35 patients) with proven MRSA eligible for PreASD 23 patients (65%) responded to an interview. 22 of those (95.6%) would have agreed to PreASD. Additional costs for a screening protocol adapted to the needs of MRSA-PreASD of 52,061euro were estimated. Additional hospitalization costs of 6100-9300euro per MRSA case in Germany have been published. In our study population the successful pre-admission decolonization of 22 cases (63% of 35 patients eligible) may therefore have saved about 134,000-205,000euro. Thus from an economic point of view our concept should be justified. In conclusion a relevant number of affected admissions to our tertiary referral hospital is eligible for an MRSA-PreASD. The majority of patients with proven MRSA-colonization eligible for a pre-admission decolonization treatment would prefer such an approach over being isolated at the hospital. The implementation of an MRSA-PreASD-protocol may reduce costs.",0
9973297,"Genetic mapping to 10q23.3-q24.2, in a large Italian pedigree, of a new syndrome showing bilateral cataracts, gastroesophageal reflux, and spastic paraparesis with amyotrophy","We have recently observed a large pedigree with a new rare autosomal dominant spastic paraparesis. In three subsequent generations, 13 affected individuals presented with bilateral cataracts, gastroesophageal reflux with persistent vomiting, and spastic paraparesis with amyotrophy. Bilateral cataracts occurred in all affected individuals, with the exception of one patient who presented with a chorioretinal dystrophy, whereas clinical signs of spastic paraparesis showed a variable expressivity. Using a genomewide mapping approach, we mapped the disorder to the long arm of chromosome 10 on band q23.3-q24.2, in a 12-cM chromosomal region where additional neurologic disorders have been localized. The spectrum of phenotypic manifestations in this family is reminiscent of a smaller pedigree, reported recently, confirming the possibility of a new syndrome. Finally, the anticipation of symptoms suggests that an unstable trinucleotide repeat may be responsible for the condition.",1

Related existing problems include repeated researches into the same indexes of action mechanisms of different therapeutic principles of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Chinese herbal compound and special prescriptions, studies focusing on individual diseases but ignoring symptoms, immature syndrome models for studies of mechanisms, and too much attention to uncertain or immature target mechanisms. The stress should be placed on the action mechanisms of Chinese herbal compound and special prescriptions on male diseases and, what is more important, on the clarification of the essential principles of differentiation and treatment of TCM syndromes. In the recent years, proteomics, genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics have shed some light upon researches into the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of the disease-syndrome combination approach in integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine in andrology. An insight into the TCM syndrome, a macroscopic inductive analysis, and a comprehension of such microcosmic aspects as the gene, protein, metabolism and metagenome may contribute to some breakthroughs and new ideas in the studies of disease-syndrome combination in integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine in andrology.",0

14743860,How do UV photomorphogenic responses confer water stress tolerance?,"Although ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation is potentially harmful, it is an important component of terrestrial radiation to which plants have been exposed since invading land. Since then, plants have evolved mechanisms to avoid and repair UV radiation damage; therefore, it is not surprising that photomorphogenic responses to UV-B are often assumed to be adaptations to harmful radiation. This presupposes that the function of the observed responses is to prevent UV damage. It has been hypothesized that, as with blue light, UV-B provides a signal important for normal plant development and might be perceived within developing plants through nondestructive processes, perhaps through UV-specific signal perception mechanisms. UV signal perception can lead to photomorphogenic responses that may confer adaptive advantages under conditions associated with high-light environments, such as water stress. Plant responses to UV radiation in this regard include changes in leaf area, leaf thickness, stomatal density, photosynthetic pigment production and altered stem elongation and branching patterns. Such responses may lead to altered transpiration rates and water-use efficiencies. For example, we found that the cumulative effect of ambient UV-B radiation upon stomatal density and conductance can lead to altered water-use efficiencies. In field settings, UV might more properly be viewed as a photomorphogenic signal than as a stressor. Hence, it might be insufficient to attempt to fully evaluate the adaptive roles of plant responses to UV-B cues upon stress tolerance by the simultaneous application of UV and drought stress during development. We propose that rather than examining a plant's response to combinations of stressors one might also examine how a plant's response to UV induces tolerance to subsequently applied stresses.",0

26727639,A comparison of discharge strategies after chemotherapy completion in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia: a report from the Children's Oncology Group,"While most children receive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) chemotherapy as inpatients, there is variability in timing of discharge after chemotherapy completion. This study compared treatment-related morbidity, mortality and cumulative hospitalization in children with AML who were discharged after chemotherapy completion (early discharge) and those who remained hospitalized. Chart abstraction data for 153 early discharge-eligible patients enrolled on a Children's Oncology Group trial were compared by discharge strategy. Targeted toxicities included viridans group streptococcal (VGS) bacteremia, hypoxia and hypotension. Early discharge occurred in 11% of courses post-Induction I. Re-admission occurred in 80-100%, but median hospital stay was 7 days shorter. Patients discharged early had higher rates of VGS (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.11-2.51), hypoxia (aRR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.06-3.48) and hypotension (aRR = 4.36, 95% CI = 2.01-9.46), but there was no difference in mortality. As pressure increases to shorten hospitalizations, these results have important implications for determining discharge practices in pediatric AML.",0
22900971,Studies of the di-iron(VI) Intermediate in ferrate-dependent oxygen evolution from water,"Molecular oxygen is produced from water via the following reaction of potassium ferrate (K(2)FeO(4)) in acidic solution: 4[H(3)Fe(VI)O(4)](+) + 8H(3)O(+) --> 4Fe(3+) + 3O(2) + 18H(2)O. This study focuses upon the mechanism by which the O-O bond is formed. Stopped-flow kinetics at variable acidities in H(2)O and D(2)O are used to complement the analysis of competitive oxygen-18 kinetic isotope effects ((18)O KIEs) upon consumption of natural abundance water. The derived (18)O KIEs provide insights concerning the identity of the transition state. Water attack (WA) and oxo-coupling (OC) transition states were evaluated for various reactions of monomeric and dimeric ferrates using a calibrated density functional theory protocol. Vibrational frequencies from optimized isotopic structures are used here to predict (18)O KIEs for comparison to experimental values determined using an established competitive isotope-fractionation method. The high level of agreement between experimental and theoretic isotope effects points to an intramolecular OC mechanism within a di-iron(VI) intermediate, consistent with the analysis of the reaction kinetics. Alternative mechanisms are excluded based on insurmountably high free energy barriers and disagreement with calculated (18)O KIEs.",0
19251363,Childhood psychosocial stressors and adult onset arthritis: broad spectrum risk factors and allostatic load,"Neural, endocrine, and immune stress mediators are hypothesized to increase risks of diverse chronic diseases, including arthritis. Retrospective data from the World Mental Health Surveys (N=18,309) were employed to assess whether adult onset of arthritis was associated with childhood adversities and early onset psychological disorder. Cox proportional hazard models assessed the association of number of childhood adversities and the presence of early onset psychological disorder with arthritis age of onset. Controlling for age, sex, and early onset mental disorder, relative to persons with no childhood adversities, persons with two adversities had an increased risk of adult onset arthritis (hazard ratio=1.27, 95% CI=1.08, 1.50), while persons with three or more adversities had a higher risk (HR=1.44, CI=1.24, 1.67). Early onset depressive and/or anxiety disorder was associated with an increased risk of adult onset arthritis after controlling for childhood adversities (HR=1.43, CI=1.28, 1.61). Since psychosocial stressors may be broad spectrum risk factors that increase risks of diverse chronic conditions in later life (e.g. arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, and chronic pain), prospective studies of childhood psychosocial stressors may be most productive if multiple disease outcomes are assessed in the same study. Results from this study provide methodological guidance for future prospective studies of the relationship between childhood psychosocial stressors and subsequent risk of adult onset arthritis.",0
1373758,Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Tat-reactive antibodies present in normal HIV-negative sera and depleted in HIV-positive sera. Identification of the epitope,"We have detected, in sera of normal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-free subjects, IgM antibodies reactive with the Tat protein of HIV in significant titers and at very high frequency, and, in HIV-positive sera, progressively lower titers as HIV pathogenesis ensues. Epitope analysis indicates that the Tat-reactive antibodies of both HIV-negative and HIV-positive sera are homologous, suggesting, therefore, that their decline in HIV-positive sera may represent attrition of a host defense factor. The identified epitope displays minimal homology with that previously defined for another set of IgM antibodies shown to be present in normal sera, deficient in HIV-positive sera, and postulated to be natural antibodies. We propose that the Tat-reactive antibodies, as well, are a set of natural antibodies and that the normal humoral immune system includes a repertoire of antibodies, nonimmunogenic in origin, that contribute to immune homeostasis and, consequently, to host resistance to HIV pathogenesis.",0
20133464,Identification of a second kindred with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3 (FHH3) narrows localization to a <3.5 megabase pair region on chromosome 19q13.3,"CONTEXT: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is a genetically heterogenous disorder that consists of three defined types, FHH1, FHH2, and FHH3 whose chromosomal locations are 3q21.1, 19p, and 19q13, respectively. FHH1, caused by mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), occurs in more than 65% of patients, whereas the abnormalities underlying FHH2 and FHH3, which have each been described in single North American kindreds, are unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the basis of FHH in a proband, who did not have CASR mutations, and her kindred. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The proband was a 43-yr-old woman who presented with a corrected serum calcium of 2.74 mmol/liter (normal = 2.15-2.55 mmol/liter), a serum PTH of 47 pg/ml (normal = 10-65 pg/ml), and a urinary calcium clearance:creatinine clearance of 0.006. She did not have a CASR mutation within the coding region and splice sites, and 24 members from three generations of her kindred were ascertained and investigated for serum abnormalities and cosegregation with polymorphic loci from chromosomes 3q21.1 and 19q13 using leukocyte DNA. RESULTS: Sixteen members were hypercalcemic with normal or elevated serum PTH concentrations and mild hypophosphatemia, features consistent with FHH3. Use of microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphic loci from chromosome 19q13.3 demonstrated cosegregation with FHH in the kindred, with a peak LOD score = 5.98 at 0% recombination with D19S412. Analysis of recombinants mapped FHH to a 3.46-Mbp interval flanked centromerically by single nucleotide polymorphism rs1990932 and telomerically by D19S604. CONCLUSIONS: FHH3 may explain the calcium homeostasis disorder in those FHH patients who do not have CASR mutations.",1

15543136,The Williams syndrome transcription factor interacts with PCNA to target chromatin remodelling by ISWI to replication foci,"Chromatin states have to be faithfully duplicated during DNA replication to maintain cell identity. It is unclear whether or how ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling factors are involved in this process. Here we provide evidence that the Williams syndrome transcription factor (WSTF) is targeted to replication foci through direct interaction with the DNA clamp PCNA, an important coordinator of DNA and chromatin replication. WSTF, in turn, recruits imitation switch (ISWI)-type nucleosome-remodelling factor SNF2H to replication sites. These findings reveal a novel recruitment mechanism for ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling factors that is fundamentally different from the previously documented targeting by sequence-specific transcriptional regulators. RNA-interference-mediated depletion of WSTF or SNF2H causes a compaction of newly replicated chromatin and increases the amount of heterochromatin markers, including HP1beta. This increase in the amount of HP1beta protein is mediated by progression through S phase and is not the result of an increase in HP1beta mRNA levels. We propose that the WSTF-ISWI complex has a role in the maintenance of chromatin structures during DNA replication.",1
8209894,Restoration of half the normal dystrophin sequence in a double-deletion Duchenne muscular dystrophy family,"Two male cousins with Duchenne muscular dystrophy were found to have different maternal dystrophin gene haplotypes and different deletion mutations. One propositus showed two noncontiguous deletions--one in the 5', proximal deletional hotspot region, and the other in the 3', more distal deletional hotspot region. The second propositus showed only the 5' deletion. Using multiple fluorescent exon dosage and fluorescent multiplex CA repeat linkage analyses, we show that the mother of each propositus carries both deletions on the same grandmaternal X chromosome. This paradox is explained by a single recombinational event between the 2 deleted regions of one of the carrier's dystrophin genes, giving rise to a son with a partially ",1
25615793,Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump is a major regulator of glucose transport in the healthy and diabetic heart,"Despite intensive research, the pathways that mediate calcium (Ca(2+))-stimulated glucose transport in striated muscle remain elusive. Since the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump tightly regulates cytosolic [Ca(2+)], we investigated whether the SERCA pump is a major regulator of cardiac glucose transport. We used healthy and insulin-deficient diabetic transgenic (TG) mice expressing SERCA1a in the heart. Active cell surface glucose transporter (GLUT)-4 was measured by a biotinylated photolabeled assay in the intact perfused myocardium and isolated myocytes. In healthy TG mice, cardiac-specific SERCA1a expression increased active cell-surface GLUT4 and glucose uptake in the myocardium, as well as whole body glucose tolerance. Diabetes reduced active cell-surface GLUT4 content and glucose uptake in the heart of wild type mice, all of which were preserved in diabetic TG mice. Decreased basal AS160 and increased proportion of calmodulin-bound AS160 paralleled the increase in cell surface GLUT4 content in the heart of TG mice, suggesting that AS160 regulates GLUT trafficking by a Ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent pathway. In addition, cardiac-specific SERCA1a expression partially rescues hyperglycemia during diabetes. Collectively, these data suggested that the SERCA pump is a major regulator of cardiac glucose transport by an AS160 dependent mechanism during healthy and insulin-deficient state. Our data further indicated that cardiac-specific SERCA overexpression rescues diabetes induced-alterations in cardiac glucose transport and improves whole body glucose homeostasis. Therefore, findings from this study provide novel mechanistic insights linking upregulation of the SERCA pump in the heart as a potential therapeutic target to improve glucose metabolism during diabetes.

25487843,Risks and burden of viral respiratory tract infections in patients with multiple myeloma in the era of immunomodulatory drugs and bortezomib: experience at an Australian Cancer Hospital,"INTRODUCTION: Infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple myeloma. The epidemiology, risk factors and outcomes of viral respiratory tract infections (vRTI) are not well described in patients with multiple myeloma managed with novel agents, the current standard of care. METHODS: Patients with myeloma from 2009 to 2012 who tested positive on respiratory virus multiplex polymerase chain reaction had clinical, radiological and microbiological records reviewed. The Fourth European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL-4) definitions of RTI were applied. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis of risk factors was performed using vRTI as the evaluable outcome. RESULTS: Of 330 patients, 75 (22.7%) tested positive for a total of 100 vRTI episodes. All patients received thalidomide, lenalidomide or bortezomib in combination with myeloma therapies (median of three treatment regimens). vRTI occurred most commonly in patients with progressive disease, and receipt of more than three lines of myeloma therapy was associated with an increased risk of vRTI (p < 0.01). Amongst key respiratory pathogens, influenza was associated with the highest hospital admission rate (66.7%), ICU admission rate (41.6%) and mortality (33.3%) whilst RSV was associated with prolonged hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Patients with multiple myeloma and advanced disease managed with multiple lines of therapy are at risk for vRTI, and targeted interventions for prevention/treatment are required.",0
416211,"E1k, another quantitative variant at cholinesterase locus 1",Two families segregating for the atypical (E1a) allele at cholinesterase locus 1 are described. Unusual results for dibucaine inhibition led to the recognition of a new allele (E1k) also segregating in these families. The enzymatic and immunological data are consistent with the hypothesis that E1k causes reduction of 'usual' (E1u) molecules by about 33%. Whether the reduction of E1u caused by E1k is caused by retarded synthesis or accelerated degradation of serum cholinesterase remains to be determined.,1
25848183,"Laparoscopic radical trachelectomy: technique, feasibility, and outcomes","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Our objectives are to describe our surgical technique for laparoscopic radical trachelectomy, to evaluate its feasibility, and to present the perioperative results at Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Argentina. METHODS: We analyzed 4 patients who underwent laparoscopic radical trachelectomy for early-stage cervical cancer between December 2011 and May 2013. RESULTS: Four patients were included in this study. Total laparoscopic radical trachelectomy was performed in all cases. The mean age was 26 years (range, 19-32 years), the mean body mass index was 21 (range, 18-23), and the mean length of hospital stay was 33 hours (range, 24-36 hours). The mean operative time was 225 minutes (range, 210-240 minutes), and no complications were reported. During the postoperative period, only 1 patient presented with left vulvar edema, which resolved spontaneously. The pelvic and parametrial lymph nodes, as well as the vaginal cuff and cervical resection margins, were negative for malignancy in all cases. On average, 18 pelvic lymph nodes (range, 15-20) were removed. The tumor stage was IB in all 4 patients, and the mean tumor size was 17 mm (range, 12-31 mm). No patient required conversion to laparotomy. CONCLUSION: We consider laparoscopic radical trachelectomy, performed by trained surgeons, a feasible and safe therapeutic option as a fertility-sparing surgical technique, with good perioperative outcomes for women with early-stage cervical cancer with a desire to preserve their fertility. Minimally invasive surgery provides the widely known benefits of this type of approach.",0
9013859,"Identification of two new mu-adaptin-related proteins, mu-ARP1 and mu-ARP2","We report the cDNA cloning, primary structure and tissue distribution of two new proteins homologous to mu-adaptins, the medium chains of the clathrin coat adaptor complexes. Both predicted proteins share 60% amino acid sequence identity with each other and 27-31%, identity with mu1-adaptin (ap47) and mu2-adaptin (ap50). Lower similarity (23-25% identity) is found with two other mu-adaptin-related proteins, p47A/B, and there is similarity over the N-terminal 150 amino acids with the adaptin small chains and deltaCOP. The mRNAs of both molecules are expressed in all tissues analyzed, but with different profiles of relative abundance. mu-ARP1 is most abundant in brain, ovary and lung, whereas mu-ARP2 is prominently expressed in testis. These proteins suggest the existence of as yet uncharacterized types of clathrin- or non-clathrin-associated protein coats in cellular membrane traffic, of which they are probably prototype subunits, and provide molecular markers and probes for their characterization.",1

9417906,"An ancient conserved gene expressed in the human inner ear: identification, expression analysis, and chromosomal mapping of human and mouse antiquitin (ATQ1)","We constructed and screened a human fetal cochlear cDNA library to identify genes involved in hearing and deafness. From this library we isolated a cDNA corresponding to the highly conserved ancient gene antiquitin (ATQ1). The plant homolog of ATQ1 is thought to be involved in regulating turgor pressure, a function that also would be essential for cells of the mammalian cochlea. Northern blots of 13 human fetal tissues show antiquitin to be highly expressed in cochlea, ovary, eye, heart, and kidney. Using RT-PCR of rat cochlear hair cell-specific cDNA libraries, we detect antiquitin expression in outer hair cells, but not in inner or vestibular type 1 hair cells, suggesting that antiquitin is not expressed ubiquitously in the cochlea. Human ATQ1 was mapped to human chromosome region 5q31 using fluorescence in situ hybridization, and mouse ATQ1 was mapped to mouse chromosome 18 by single-strand conformation polymorphism mapping of interspecific backcross progeny DNAs. Four human antiquitin-like sequences, possibly pseudogenes, were also identified and mapped.",1
25639891,Mechanism-based inactivation of CYP450 enzymes: a case study of lapatinib,"Mechanism-based inactivation (MBI) of CYP450 enzymes is a unique form of inhibition in which the enzymatic machinery of the victim is responsible for generation of the reactive metabolite. This precondition sets up a time-dependency for the inactivation process, a hallmark feature that characterizes all MBI. Yet, MBI itself is a complex biochemical phenomenon that operates in different modes, namely, covalent binding to apoprotein, covalent binding of the porphyrin group and also complexation of the catalytic iron. Using lapatinib as a recent example of toxicological interest, we present an example of a mixed-function MBI that can confound clinical drug-drug interactions manifestation. Lapatinib exhibits both covalent binding to the apoprotein and formation of a metabolite-intermediate complex in an enzyme-selective manner (CYP3A4 versus CYP3A5), each with different reactive metabolites. The clinical implication of this effect is also contingent upon genetic polymorphisms of the enzyme involved as well as the co-administration of other substrates, inhibitors or inducers, culminating in drug-drug interactions. This understanding recapitulates the importance of applying isoform-specific mechanistic investigations to develop customized strategies to manage such outcomes. ",0
12970120,Thrombin and platelet activation,"The accumulation of thrombin at sites of vascular injury provides one of the chief means for recruiting platelets into a growing hemostatic plug. Studies completed over the past 10 years show that platelet responses to thrombin are mediated by a subset of G protein-coupled receptors known as protease-activated receptors. These receptors are activated on cleavage by thrombin, initiating the intracellular signaling events needed to transform mobile, nonadhesive platelets into cells that can participate in the growth of an immobile hemostatic plug. How this is accomplished is the subject of this review.",0
25119038,AhR sensing of bacterial pigments regulates antibacterial defence,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a highly conserved ligand-dependent transcription factor that senses environmental toxins and endogenous ligands, thereby inducing detoxifying enzymes and modulating immune cell differentiation and responses. We hypothesized that AhR evolved to sense not only environmental pollutants but also microbial insults. We characterized bacterial pigmented virulence factors, namely the phenazines from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the naphthoquinone phthiocol from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as ligands of AhR. Upon ligand binding, AhR activation leads to virulence factor degradation and regulated cytokine and chemokine production. The relevance of AhR to host defence is underlined by heightened susceptibility of AhR-deficient mice to both P. aeruginosa and M. tuberculosis. Thus, we demonstrate that AhR senses distinct bacterial virulence factors and controls antibacterial responses, supporting a previously unidentified role for AhR as an intracellular pattern recognition receptor, and identify bacterial pigments as a new class of pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

15689447,CDKL5/STK9 is mutated in Rett syndrome variant with infantile spasms,"BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, almost exclusively affecting females and characterised by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Both the classic form and preserved speech variant of Rett syndrome are due to mutations in the MECP2 gene. Several other variants of Rett syndrome have been described. In 1985, Hanefeld described a variant with the early appearance of convulsions. In this variant, the normal perinatal period is soon followed by the appearance of seizures, usually infantile spasms. We have observed two patients with signs of Rett syndrome showing acquired microcephaly and stereotypic midline hand movements. The disease started with generalised convulsions and myoclonic fits at 1.5 months in the first patient and with spasms at 10 days in the other, suggesting a diagnosis of the Hanefeld variant. In these patients, MECP2 point mutations and gross rearrangements were excluded by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and real time quantitative PCR. The ARX and CDKL5 genes have been associated with West syndrome (infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and mental retardation). METHODS: Based on the clinical overlap between the Hanefeld variant and West syndrome, we analysed ARX and CDKL5 in the two girls. RESULTS: We found frameshift deletions in CDKL5 in both patients; one in exon 5 (c.163_166delGAAA) and the other in exon 18 (c.2635_2636delCT). CDKL5 was then analysed in 19 classic Rett and 15 preserved speech variant patients, all MECP2 negative, but no mutations were found. CONCLUSION: Our results show that CDKL5 is responsible for a rare variant of Rett syndrome characterised by early development of convulsions, usually of the spasm type.",1
9052791,Motor axon subpopulations respond differentially to the chemorepellents netrin-1 and semaphorin D,"During development, growing motor axons are excluded from the ventral midline of the neural tube by diffusible chemorepellents emanating from this region. Molecular candidates for this chemorepellent activity include semaphorin D and netrin-1; the latter is known to repel trochlear motor axons. Qualitatively or quantitatively different responses to these molecules might underlie the initial deflection from the midline and subsequent segregation of motor axon trajectories. To test this idea, we have cocultured cell aggregates secreting netrin-1 or semaphorin D at a distance from tissue explants containing different motor neuron subpopulations, in collagen gels. Cranial motor axons that project dorsally in vivo such as those of the trigeminal, facial, and glossopharyngeal nuclei were repelled by both netrin-1 and semaphorin D. By contrast, ventrally projecting spinal motor axons and abducens axons were not affected by netrin-1. Spinal and abducens motor neurons also responded to semaphorin D. The ventrally projecting axons of oculomotor neurons were not repelled by netrin-1 or semaphorin D. Differential responsiveness to netrin-1 and semaphorin D could thus contribute to the generation of dorsal and ventral motor axon pathways during development.",0
32947886,Probing the Highly Disparate Dual Inhibitory Mechanisms of Novel Quinazoline Derivatives against Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protein Kinases A and B,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) Protein kinases A (PknA) and B (PknB) have been identified as highly attractive targets for overcoming drug resistant tuberculosis. A recent lead series optimization study yielded compound 33 which exhibited potencies ~1000 times higher than compound 57. This huge discrepancy left us curious to investigate the mechanistic 'dual' (in)activities of the compound using computational methods, as carried out in this study. Findings revealed that 33 stabilized the PknA and B conformations and reduced their structural activities relative to 57. Optimal stability of 33 in the hydrophobic pockets further induced systemic alterations at the P-loops, catalytic loops, helix Cs and DFG motifs of PknA and B. Comparatively, 57 was more surface-bound with highly unstable motions. Furthermore, 33 demonstrated similar binding patterns in PknA and B, involving conserved residues of their binding pockets. Both pi and hydrogen interactions played crucial roles in the binding of 33, which altogether culminated in high DeltaGs for both proteins. On the contrary, the binding of 57 was characterized by unfavorable interactions with possible repulsive effects on its optimal dual binding to both proteins, as evidenced by the relatively lowered DeltaGs. These findings would significantly contribute to the rational structure-based design of novel and highly selective dual inhibitors of Mtb PknA and B.",0
29641360,Facing the Maze: Young Cancer Survivors' Return to Education and Work-A Professional Expert Key Informant Study,"PURPOSE: An insufficient transition to normal life after cancer treatment in adolescent and young adults (AYAs) may lead to decreased occupational and educational opportunities throughout a survivor's lifespan. Key informant interviews were used to access unique knowledge of the healthcare, educational, and social systems. METHODS: We used key informant interviews with professionals representing disciplines from healthcare, educational, and social systems (n = 15). Informants were recruited through purposive sampling and snowball sampling. Interviews were analyzed thematically using Malterud's Systematic Text Condensation and verified by member checking. RESULTS: We found four major themes: the impact of late effects, navigating the system, social reintegration, and the drive of youth. Although legal frameworks are often in place to assist AYA cancer survivors, navigating the public, educational, and social systems is a complex task and many AYAs do not have the required skill set or energy. Furthermore, AYA survivors often feel different from their peers and misunderstood by their surroundings, which may hinder reintegration into normal social life. CONCLUSIONS: In Scandinavia, healthcare and education are free of charge with equal access for all, primarily funded by government taxes. Therefore, insurance status and tuition fees should not constitute barriers for returning to education and work. However, this study finds that the public and educational systems are complex to navigate, and that AYAs face trouble mobilizing the energy to receive needed support.",0
25202817,Sex differences in biomarkers associated with insulin resistance in obese adolescents: metabolomic profiling and principal components analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Obesity and insulin resistance (IR) predispose to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Yet only half of obese adolescents have IR and far fewer progress to type 2 diabetes mellitus. We hypothesized that amino acid and fatty acid metabolites may serve as biomarkers or determinants of IR in obese teens. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fasting blood samples were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry in 82 obese adolescents. A principal components analysis and multiple linear regression models were used to correlate metabolic components with surrogate measures of IR: homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), adiponectin, and triglyceride (TG) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio. RESULTS: Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) levels and products of BCAA catabolism were higher (P < .01) in males than females with comparable body mass index (BMI) z-score. In multivariate analyses, HOMA-IR in males correlated positively with BMI z-score and a metabolic signature containing BCAA, uric acid, and long-chain acylcarnitines and negatively with byproducts of complete fatty acid oxidation (R(2) = 0.659, P < .0001). In contrast, only BMI z-score correlated with HOMA-IR in females. Adiponectin correlated inversely with BCAA and uric acid (R(2) = 0.268, P = .0212) in males but not females. TG to HDL ratio correlated with BMI z-score and the BCAA signature in females but not males. CONCLUSIONS: BCAA levels and byproducts of BCAA catabolism are higher in obese teenage boys than girls of comparable BMI z-score. A metabolic signature comprising BCAA and uric acid correlates positively with HOMA-IR in males and TG to HDL ratio in females and inversely with adiponectin in males but not females. Likewise, byproducts of fatty acid oxidation associate inversely with HOMA-IR in males but not females. Our findings underscore the roles of sex differences in metabolic function and outcomes in pediatric obesity.",0

We have isolated a candidate gene (Mc1) for Menkes disease and find qualitative or quantitative abnormalities in the mRNA in sixteen of twenty-one Menkes patients. Four patients lacking Mc1RNA showed rearrangements of the Menkes gene. The gene codes for a 1,500 amino acid protein, predicted to be a P-type cation-transporting ATPase. The gene product is most similar to a bacterial copper-transporting ATPase and additionally contains six putative metal-binding motifs at the N-terminus. The gene is transcribed in all cell types tested except liver, consistent with the expression of the Menkes defect.",1
22818856,Dominant mutation of CCDC78 in a unique congenital myopathy with prominent internal nuclei and atypical cores,"Congenital myopathies are clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases that typically present in childhood with hypotonia and weakness and are most commonly defined by changes observed in muscle biopsy. Approximately 40% of congenital myopathies are currently genetically unresolved. We identified a family with dominantly inherited congenital myopathy characterized by distal weakness and biopsy changes that included core-like areas and increased internalized nuclei. To identify the causative genetic abnormality in this family, we performed linkage analysis followed by whole-exome capture and next-generation sequencing. A splice-acceptor variant in previously uncharacterized CCDC78 was detected in affected individuals and absent in unaffected family members and > 10,000 controls. This variant alters RNA-transcript processing and results in a 222 bp in-frame insertion. CCDC78 is expressed in skeletal muscle, enriched in the perinuclear region and the triad, and found in intracellular aggregates in patient muscle. Modeling of the CCDC78 mutation in zebrafish resulted in changes mirroring the human disease that included altered motor function and abnormal muscle ultrastructure. Using a combination of linkage analysis, next-generation sequencing, and modeling in the zebrafish, we have identified a CCDC78 mutation associated with a unique myopathy with prominent internal nuclei and atypical cores.",1
10839544,Functional link between ataxia-telangiectasia and Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene products,"Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) are recessive genetic disorders with susceptibility to cancer and similar cellular phenotypes. The protein product of the gene responsible for A-T, designated ATM, is a member of a family of kinases characterized by a carboxy-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like domain. The NBS1 protein is specifically mutated in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome and forms a complex with the DNA repair proteins Rad50 and Mrel1. Here we show that phosphorylation of NBS1, induced by ionizing radiation, requires catalytically active ATM. Complexes containing ATM and NBS1 exist in vivo in both untreated cells and cells treated with ionizing radiation. We have identified two residues of NBS1, Ser 278 and Ser 343 that are phosphorylated in vitro by ATM and whose modification in vivo is essential for the cellular response to DNA damage. This response includes S-phase checkpoint activation, formation of the NBS1/Mrel1/Rad50 nuclear foci and rescue of hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. Together, these results demonstrate a biochemical link between cell-cycle checkpoints activated by DNA damage and DNA repair in two genetic diseases with overlapping phenotypes.",1

30204444,Partial Hydrogenation of Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds: Toward Ligand-Directed Heterogeneous Catalysis,"In this Perspective, we report on the recent progress in atomistic-level understanding of selective partial hydrogenation of alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, particularly acrolein, toward unsaturated alcohols over model single crystalline and nanostructured Pd catalysts. This reaction was observed to proceed with nearly 100% selectivity over Pd(111) but not over supported Pd nanoparticles. The origin of the high selectivity was related to formation of a dense overlayer of oxopropyl surface species occurring at the early reaction stages via partial hydrogenation of the C=C bond in acrolein with only one H atom. This oxopropyl overlayer strongly modifies the adsorption and reactive properties of Pd(111), turning it 100% selective toward C=O bond hydrogenation. The underlying reaction mechanism represents a particular case of ligand-directed heterogeneous catalysis, in which the surface adsorbates do not directly participate in the catalytic process as the reaction intermediates but strongly affect the elementary reaction steps via specific adsorbate-adsorbate interactions.",0
26595553,Genome-Wide Copy Number Variation Scan Identifies Complement Component C4 as Novel Susceptibility Gene for Crohn's Disease,"BACKGROUND: The genetic component of Crohn's disease (CD) is well known, with 140 susceptibility loci identified so far. In addition to single nucleotide polymorphisms typically studied in genome-wide scans, copy number variation is responsible for a large proportion of human genetic variation. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide search for copy number variants associated with CD using array comparative genomic hybridization. One of the found regions was validated independently through real-time PCR. Serum levels of the found gene were measured in patients and control subjects. RESULTS: We found copy number differences for the C4S and C4L gene variants of complement component C4 in the central major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 6p21. Specifically, we saw that CD patients tend to have lower C4L and higher C4S copies than control subjects (P = 5.00 x 10 and P = 9.11 x 10), which was independent of known associated classical HLA I and II alleles (P = 7.68 x 10 and P = 6.29 x 10). Although C4 serum levels were not different between patients and control subjects, the relationship between C4 copy number and serum level was different for patients and control subjects with higher copy numbers leading to higher serum concentrations in control subjects, compared with CD patients (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: C4 is part of the classical activation pathway of the complement system, which is important for (auto)immunity. Low C4L or high C4S copy number, and corresponding effects on C4 serum level, could lead to an exaggerated response against infections, possibly leading to (auto)immune disease.",0
32789073,Retroperitoneal Ganglioneuroma in a Patient Presenting With Vague Abdominal Pain,"Ganglioneuroblastoma, neuroblastoma, and ganglioneuroma (GN) are the tumors that arise from the neural crest cells. Of these, GN has the most benign origin without metastatic potential. The most common sites of their origin are the posterior mediastinum and retroperitoneum. Although the imaging studies, including CT, are available to detect these tumors, the definitive diagnosis can only be made by histological examination. We present a case of a 40-year-old woman with a retroperitoneal GN causing longstanding, gradually increasing, uncontrolled abdominal pain due to its pressure effect on the pancreas, duodenum, and right kidney with the displacement of the inferior vena cava. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, and the mass was removed. Histopathology confirmed the benign nature of the mass (a GN). These tumors are rarely malignant and mostly asymptomatic.

After a discussion with the patient, an elective surgical procedure was performed, and the patient was symptom-free postoperatively and able to resume her regular routine.",0
10552811,Pyrazine formation from serine and threonine,"The formation of pyrazines from L-serine and L-threonine has been studied. L-Serine and L-threonine, either alone or combined, were heated at 120 degrees C as low temperature for 4 h or at 300 degrees C as high temperature for 7 min. The pyrazines formed from each reaction were identified by GC/MS, and the yields (to the amino acid used, as parts per million) were determined by GC/FID. It was found that pyrazine, methylpyrazine, ethylpyrazine, 2-ethyl-6-methylpyrazine, and 2,6-diethylpyrazine were formed from serine, whereas 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, 2,6-dimethylpyrazine, trimethylpyrazine, 2-ethyl-3,6-dimethylpyrazine, and 2-ethyl-3, 5-dimethylpyrazine were formed from threonine. Mechanistically, it is proposed that the thermal degradation of serine or threonine is composed of various complex reactions. Among these reactions, decarbonylation followed by dehydration is the main pathway to generate the alpha-aminocarbonyl intermediates leading to the formation of the main product, such as pyrazine from serine or 2, 5-dimethylpyrazine from threonine. Also, deamination after decarbonylation generates more reactive intermediates, alpha-hydroxycarbonyls. Furthermore, aldol condensation of these reactive intermediates provides alpha-dicarbonyls. Subsequently, these alpha-dicarbonyls react with the remaining serine or threonine by Strecker degradation to form additional alpha-aminocarbonyl intermediates, which then form additional pyrazines. In addition, decarboxylation and retroaldol reaction may also involve the generation of the intermediates.",0
23989887,Differential regulation of angiopoietin 1 and angiopoietin 2 during dengue virus infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells: implications for endothelial hyperpermeability,"Infection with dengue virus (DV) can result in dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, where patients suffer from bleeding and plasma leakage involving endothelial cells. Angiopoietins (Ang) 1 and 2 are important angiogenic factors that affect endothelial barrier integrity. In this study, DV was observed to induce endothelial leakage at multiplicity of infection of 10 in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with interendothelial gap formation. Immunostaining of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and zona occludin 1 (ZO-1) showed the absence of these endothelial junctional proteins at the cell-cell contact zones between adjacent cells. In addition, Ang1 that is required for protecting against endothelial hyperpermeability was found to be down-regulated during DV infection. Treatment with increasing concentrations of recombinant Ang1 was shown to prevent DV-induced endothelial hyperpermeability in a dose-dependent manner by preventing the down-regulation of VE-cadherin and ZO-1 at cell membrane. In contrast, the expression of Ang2, the natural antagonist of Ang1, was observed to be up-regulated during DV infection. Recombinant Ang2 added to HUVEC at non-toxic concentrations showed decreased in transendothelial electrical resistance reading and the down-regulation of VE-cadherin and ZO-1. These findings suggest that DV reduces the expression of Ang1 and enhances the expression of Ang2 in endothelial cells and that this imbalance of Ang 1 and Ang 2 may play a contributing role to the increased permeability of human primary endothelial cells during DV infection.

32607211,Genetic structure among morphotypes of the endangered Brazilian palm Euterpe edulis Mart (Arecaceae),"Euterpe edulis (Arecaceae) Mart has high ecological and economic importance providing food resources for more than 58 species of birds and 20 species of mammals, including humans. E. edulis is the second most exploited nontimber product from Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Due to overexploitation and destruction of habitats, E. edulis is threatened by extinction. Euterpe edulis populations have large morphological variations, with individuals having green, red, or yellow leaf sheath. However, no study has related phenotypic distinctions between populations and their levels of genetic structure. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the diversity and genetic structure of different E. edulis morphotypes. We sampled 250 adult individuals in eight populations with the different morphotypes. Using 14 microsatellite markers, we access genetic diversity through population genetic parameters calculated in the GenAlex program and the diveRsity package in R. We used the Wilcoxon test to verify population bottlenecks and the genetic distance of Nei and Bayesian analysis for genetic clusters. The eight populations showed low allele richness, low observed heterozygosity, and high inbreeding values (f). In addition, six of the eight populations experienced genetic bottlenecks, which would partly explain the low genetic diversity in populations. Cluster analysis identified two clusters (K = 2), with green morphotype genetically distinguishing from yellow and red morphotypes. Thus, we show, for the first time, a strong genetic structure among E. edulis morphotypes even for geographically close populations.",0

12221074,Trypanosoma cruzi H+-ATPase 1 (TcHA1) and 2 (TcHA2) genes complement yeast mutants defective in H+ pumps and encode plasma membrane P-type H+-ATPases with different enzymatic properties,"Previous studies in Trypanosoma cruzi have shown that intracellular pH homeostasis requires ATP and is affected by H(+)-ATPase inhibitors, indicating a major role for ATP-driven proton pumps in intracellular pH control. In the present study, we report the cloning and sequencing of a pair of genes linked in tandem (TcHA1 and TcHA2) in T. cruzi which encode proteins with homology to fungal and plant P-type proton-pumping ATPases. The genes are expressed at the mRNA level in different developmental stages of T. cruzi: TcHA1 is expressed maximally in epimastigotes, whereas TcHA2 is expressed predominantly in trypomastigotes. The proteins predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the genes have 875 and 917 amino acids and molecular masses of 96.3 and 101.2 kDa, respectively. Full-length TcHA1 and an N-terminal truncated version of TcHA2 complemented a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain deficient in P-type H(+)-ATPase activity, the proteins localized to the yeast plasma membrane, and ATP-driven proton pumping could be detected in proteoliposomes reconstituted from plasma membrane purified from transfected yeast. The reconstituted proton transport activity was reduced by inhibitors of P-type H(+)-ATPases. C-terminal truncation did not affect complementation of mutant yeast, suggesting the lack of C-terminal autoinhibitory domains in these proteins. ATPase activity in plasma membrane from TcHA1- and (N-terminal truncated) TcHA2-transfected yeast was inhibited to different extents by vanadate, whereas the latter yeast strain was more resistant to extremes of pH, suggesting that the native proteins may serve different functions at different stages in the T. cruzi life cycle.",0
27665761,The proliferation mechanism of normal and pathological human placentas,"The placenta, which is a regulator organ for many metabolic activities between mother and fetus, is critical in influencing the outcome of pregnancy. Therefore, fetal growth is directly related to the placental development. Placental development depends on the coordinated action of trophoblast proliferation, differentiation and invasion. Studies on cell cycle related proteins that control these events are limited. Abnormal placental development is linked to various pregnancy pathologies such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, diabetes mellitus and gestational trophoblastic diseases. The cell cycle mechanism of human placenta should be well understood for a healthy pregnancy outcome. Moreover, how cell cycle related proteins that control placental development are affected in pregnancy pathologies is not fully understood yet. Therefore, the aim of this review is to address the currently available knowledge on cell cycle regulatory proteins involved in human placental development and on the expression differences of these proteins in pathological placentas.",0
15921537,Optimization of the Lactococcus lactis nisin-controlled gene expression system NICE for industrial applications,"BACKGROUND: The nisin-controlled gene expression system NICE of Lactococcus lactis is one of the most widely used expression systems in Gram-positive bacteria. Despite its widespread use, no optimization of the culture conditions and nisin induction has been carried out to obtain maximum yields. As a model system induced production of lysostaphin, an antibacterial protein (mainly against Staphylococcus aureus) produced by S. simulans biovar. Staphylolyticus, was used. Three main areas need optimization for maximum yields: cell density, nisin-controlled induction and protein production, and parameters specific for the target-protein. RESULTS: In a series of pH-controlled fermentations the following parameters were optimized: pH of the culture, use of NaOH or NH4OH as neutralizing agent, the addition of zinc and phosphate, the fermentation temperature, the time point of induction (cell density of the culture), the amount of nisin added for induction and the amount of three basic medium components, i.e. yeast extract, peptone and lactose. For each culture growth and lysostaphin production was followed. Lysostaphin production yields depended on all parameters that were varied. In the course of the optimization a three-fold increase in lysostaphin yield was achieved from 100 mg/l to 300 mg/l. CONCLUSION: Protein production with the NICE gene expression system in L. lactis strongly depends on the medium composition, the fermentation parameters and the amount of nisin added for induction. Careful optimization of key parameters lead to a significant increase in the yield of the target protein.",0
8356065,"Human mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase: cDNA cloning, expression, subcellular localization, and mapping to chromosome 16","A full-length cDNA clone encoding human mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase (CA), CA V, was isolated from a human liver cDNA library. The 1123-bp cDNA includes a 55-bp 5' untranslated region, a 915-bp open reading frame, and a 153-bp 3' untranslated region. Expression of the cDNA in COS cells produced active enzyme. The 34-kDa precursor and 30-kDa mature form of CA V were identified on Western blots of COS-cell homogenates by a CA V-specific antibody raised to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 17 aa of CA V. Both 34-kDa and 30-kDa bands were also present in mitochondria isolated from transfected COS cells, whereas only the 30-kDa band was present in mitochondria isolated from normal human liver. The N-terminal sequence determined directly on the 30-kDa soluble CA purified from transfected COS cells indicated that processing of the precursor to mature human CA V involves removal of a 38-aa mitochondrial leader sequence. The 267-aa sequence deduced for mature human CA V shows 30-49% similarity to amino acid sequences of previously characterized human CAs (CA I-CA VII) and 76% similarity to the corresponding amino acid sequence deduced from the mouse cDNA. PCR analysis of DNAs from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids localized the gene for CA V to human chromosome 16, the same chromosome to which CA VII has previously been mapped.",1

21419911,Characterization of the recombinant pyrophosphate-dependent 6-phosphofructokinases from Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z and Methylococcus capsulatus Bath,"The Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) glycolysis is the starting point of the core carbon metabolism. Aerobic methanotrophs possessing activity of the pyrophosphate-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) instead of the classical glycolytic enzyme ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase (ATP-PFK) are promising model bacteria for elucidation of the role of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and PPi-dependent glycolysis in microorganisms. Characterization of the His(6)-tagged PPi-PFKs from two methanotrophs, halotolerant alkaliphilic Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z and thermotolerant Methylococcus capsulatus Bath, showed differential capabilities of PPi-PFKs to phosphorylate sedoheptulose-7-phosphate and this property correlated well with the metabolic patterns of these bacteria assimilating C(1) substrate either via the ribulosemonophosphate (RuMP) pathway (Mm. alcaliphilum 20Z) or simultaneously via the RuMP and serine pathways and the Calvin cycle (Mc. capsulatus Bath). Analysis of the genomic draft of Mm. alcaliphilum 20Z (https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/mage) has provided in silico evidence for the existence of a PPi-dependent pyruvate-phosphate dikinase (PPDK). Expression of the ppdk gene at oxygen limitation along with the presence of PPi-PFK in Mm. alcaliphilum 20Z implied functioning of PPi-dependent glycolysis and PPi recycling under conditions when oxidative phosphorylation is hampered.",0

All patients admitted at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi with diagnosis of acute kidney injury were included out of which 134 were selected via random sampling. Patients with existing CKD were excluded. Data was then collected retrospectively from medical records of these patients. Mean age was 60+/-11.7 years while mean serum creatinine on admission was 2.4+/-1.3 (mg/dl). Sepsis played a role in almost half of the patients [60 (45%)]. Other factors included diarrhoea [23 (17%)], nephrotoxic drug use [25 (19%)] and cardiac pathology [24 (18%)]. It was found that most cases of AKI were due to preventable factors (infections, diarrhoea, and drug toxicity) and concerted efforts to eliminate them would be vital in reducing mortality caused by AKI in developing countries.",0
3971968,Enzymes in polyelectrolyte complexes. The effect of phase transition on thermal stability,"Penicillin amidase, alpha-chymotrypsin and urease have been immobilized in water-soluble nonstoichiometric polyelectrolyte complexes (N-PEC). N-PEC are formed by modified poly(N-ethyl-4-vinyl-pyridinium bromide) (polycation) and excess poly(methylacrylic acid) (polyanion). N-PEC are a new class of polymers capable, characteristically, of phase transitions solution in equilibrium precipitate induced by slight change in pH or ionic strength. Neither the chemical structure of the carrier nor the number of cross-linkages between an enzyme and a carrier change on phase transition. That gives an unique opportunity to elucidate the difference between enzymes immobilized on water-soluble and water-insoluble supports. A detailed study of the phase transition effect on thermal stability of the enzymes and protein-protein interactions has been carried out. The following effects were found. Pronounced thermal stabilization of penicillin amidase and urease may be achieved on two conditions: the enzyme is in the precipitate; (b) the enzyme is linked to the N-PEC nucleus. Then the thermal stability of N-PEC-bound penicillin amidase increases 7-fold at pH 5.7, 60 degrees C, and 300-fold at pH 3.1, 25 degrees C, compared to the native enzyme. For urease, the thermal stabilization increases 20-fold at pH 5.0, 70 degrees C. The localization of enzyme on N-PEC has been established by titration of alpha-chymotrypsin bound to a polycation or polyanion with basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Both in solution (pH 6.1) and in N-PEC precipitate (pH 5.7), an alpha-chymotrypsin molecule bound to a polyanion is fully exposed to the solution. If the enzyme is bound to a polycation, only 20% of alpha-chymotrypsin molecules in the precipitate and 40% in solution retain their ability for protein-protein interactions. This means that a polycation-bound enzyme is localized in the hydrophobic nucleus of the complex, whereas the polyanion-bound enzyme sits on the hydrophilic shell of the complex. On pH-induced phase transition (pH decreases from 6.1 to 5.7), there occurs a stepwise decrease in penicillin amidase activity which is due to a 9.8-fold increase in the Km for 2-nitro-4-phenylacetamidobenzoic acid. Change of the catalytic activity and thermal stability of N-PEC-bound penicillin amidase is fully reversible and reproducible. Such soluble-insoluble immobilized enzymes with controllable thermal stability and activity may be used for simulating events in vivo and in biotechnology.",0

15367912,CD40 ligand gene and Kawasaki disease,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis syndrome of infants and young children. Although its etiology is largely unknown, epidemiological findings suggest that genetic factors play a role in the pathogenesis of KD. To identify genetic factors, affected sib-pair analysis has been performed. One of the identified peaks was located on the Xq26 region. A recent report of elevated expression of CD40 ligand (CD40L), which maps to Xq26, during the acute-phase KD, and its relationship to the development of coronary artery lesions (CAL) prompted us to screen for polymorphism of CD40L and to study the association of the gene to KD. A newly identified SNP in intron 4 (IVS4+121 A>G) is marginally over-represented in KD patients as compared to controls (109/602, 18.1 vs 111/737, 15.1%). When male KD patients with CAL were analyzed as a patient group, the SNP was significantly more frequent than in controls (15/58, 25.9%, vs 111/737, 15.1%, OR=2.0, 95% CI=1.07-3.66; P=0.030). Interestingly, this variation was extremely rare in a control Caucasian population (1/145, 0.7%). Our results suggest a role of CD40L in the pathogenesis of CAL and might explain the excess of males affected with KD.",1
9556606,Induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation by survivin gene targeting,"Survivin is a new IAP apoptosis inhibitor expressed during development and in human cancer in vivo. The coding strand of the survivin gene was extensively complementary to that of effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1), prompting the present investigation on the origin and functional relationship of these two transcripts. Southern blots of genomic DNA were consistent with the presence of multiple, evolutionarily conserved, EPR-1/Survivin-related genes. By pulsed field gel electrophoresis and single- and two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, these were contained within a contiguous physical interval of 75-130 kilobases (kb) on chromosome 17q25. In Northern blots, a single strand-specific probe identified a 1.3-kb EPR-1 mRNA broadly distributed in normal adult and fetal tissues, structurally distinct from the 1.9-kb Survivin transcript expressed in transformed cell lines. Transient co-transfection of an EPR-1 cDNA potentially acting as a Survivin antisense with a lacZ reporter plasmid resulted in loss of viability of HeLa cells. In contrast, co-transfection of an antisense cDNA of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 or a sense-oriented Survivin cDNA was without effect. In stably transfected HeLa cells, ZnSO4 induction of an EPR-1 mRNA under the control of a metallothionein promoter suppressed the expression of endogenous survivin. This resulted in (i) increased apoptosis as detected by analysis of DNA content and in situ internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and (ii) inhibition of cell proliferation as compared with induced vector control transfectants. These findings suggest the existence of a potential EPR-1/survivin gene cluster and identify survivin as a new target for disrupting cell viability pathways in cancer.",1
9776016,Urethral sphincter needle electromyography in women: comparison of periurethral and transvaginal approaches,"Needle electromyography (EMG) of the striated urethral sphincter is the only technique that permits detection of individual motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) and is a valuable diagnostic tool in the evaluation of women with urinary incontinence and voiding disorders. The purpose of this study was to compare two methods of urethral needle EMG with respect to the number of MUAPs identified, the amount of patient discomfort, and the duration of the examination. Twenty consecutive women referred for electrodiagnostic testing to evaluate symptoms of urinary incontinence and/or voiding dysfunction underwent both methods of the needle examination in a prospective randomized cross-over study design with each patient acting as her own control. A full cross-over analysis was conducted to detect period and sequence effects using analysis of variance with a power of 0.85 and a significance level of P < 0.05. Twice as many MUAPs were identified using the periurethral approach (8.8 versus 3.9) with a mean difference of 5.0 (P=0.0008). There was a non-significant trend to greater patient discomfort with the periurethral approach; however, the discomfort was generally rated as mild to moderate. The length of time required to count all identifiable MUAPs did not vary significantly between the two methods. We conclude that the periurethral approach is superior to the transvaginal approach with respect to the quantity of electrodiagnostic information obtained and propose that this method be standardized to characterize more accurately the neurogenic component of urinary incontinence and voiding dysfunction for future electrodiagnostic studies.",0

8314585,"Cloning, chromosomal mapping, and expression of human fetal brain type I adenylyl cyclase","The neural-specific calmodulin-sensitive adenylyl cyclase (type I), which was first cloned from bovine brain, has been implicated in learning and memory. The objective of this study was to clone and determine the chromosomal localization of human fetal brain type I adenylyl cyclase. A 3.8-kb cDNA clone was isolated that contained sequence coinciding with the 3' end 2553 nucleotides of the bovine open reading frame. This clone shows 87% nucleotide and 92% translated amino acid sequence identity to the bovine clone. The most significant sequence differences were in the carboxy-terminal 100 amino acid residues. This region contains one of several possible calmodulin binding domains and the only putative cAMP-dependent protein kinase A phosphorylation site. A chimera was constructed that contained the 5' half of the bovine type I adenylyl cyclase and the 3' half of the human type I adenylyl cyclase. The activity of the chimeric gene product and its sensitivity to calmodulin and calcium were indistinguishable from those of the bovine type I adenylyl cyclase. In situ hybridization was used to localize the human type I adenylyl cyclase gene to the proximal portion of the short arm of chromosome 7.",1
30111168,Amino Acid Profile of Synovial Fluid Following Intra-articular Ankle Fracture,"BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a frequent complication in patients with a previous traumatic joint injury, and the pathophysiology is not well understood. The goal of this study was to characterize the biochemical signature of amino acids, peptides, and amino acid metabolites in ankle synovial fluid following intra-articular fracture. METHODS: Synovial fluid from both the injured and contralateral ankles of 19 patients with an intra-articular ankle fracture was obtained and analyzed via metabolic profiling. Follow-up analysis was performed after 6 months in 7 of these patients. RESULTS: Statistical comparisons between injured and contralateral ankles revealed that 19 of the 66 measured amino acids, peptides, and amino acid metabolites were significantly elevated at time of fracture. Metabolites associated with glutathione metabolism exhibited the most elevated mean-fold changes, indicating a possible role for oxidative stress in fractured ankles. None of the metabolites elevated at baseline were significantly elevated after 6 months, but 6 metabolites had mean-fold changes greater than 2.1 at this time point. Multiple metabolites also exhibited significant correlations ( r > 0.575) with matrix metalloproteinase-1 and -9. CONCLUSION: These results indicate the presence of amino acid metabolic products in the setting of ankle fracture and suggest that these changes in amino acid metabolism may be chronic and indicate a role for inflammation and collagen degradation in disease progression. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Changes in amino acid metabolism following intra-articular fracture may contribute to the progression to PTOA. This knowledge may allow for the identification and early treatment of patients at risk of developing PTOA. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, comparative series.",0
7756768,Health promotion and prevention by urban renewal?,"This article is based on a study using different approaches to examine the links between urban development on the one hand and health promotion on the other. The background and basic concepts underlying this study are briefly explained. Programmatic papers from both spheres of approach result in the basic thesis that both urban development and health promotion are aiming at improving the quality of life in city districts (objective conditions of living and subjective feeling tone, i.e. subjective well-being) in the overall sense of a health-promoting general policy. Because of these common goals cooperation between both spheres is hypothesised. However, the study as a whole shows (especially an analysis of the documents of the files of the sanitation committee) that this is not so. To understand this finding better the freedom of both parties concerned to act as they should, is analysed, namely, that of the sanitation committee and of the regional health and environmental office. It becomes evident that in both these spheres the requisite monitoring capacities, such as legal support, finances, information service and counselling activities, are fundamentally lacking or indeed limited. Hence, there are limited chances of success in the spheres of health promotion and preventive care by means of sanitation of city districts. Finally, the authors point to long-term trends and developments that would make a future approach between the two spheres mandatory and (at least partially) possible.",0
16608438,All-trans retinoic acid down-regulates human albumin gene expression through the induction of C/EBPbeta-LIP,"ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid), which is a major bioactive metabolite of vitamin A and a potent regulator of development and differentiation, mediates down-regulation of the human albumin gene. However, the mechanism of ATRA-mediated down-regulation is not well understood. In the present study, deletion analysis and luciferase assays demonstrate that ATRA causes a marked decrease in the activity of the albumin promoter, the region between nt -367 and -167 from the transcription start site, where C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein)-binding sites are tightly packed, is indispensable for ATRA-mediated down-regulation. ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays revealed that in vivo binding of C/EBPalpha to the region markedly decreases upon incubation with ATRA, whereas ATRA treatment marginally increases the recruitment of C/EBPbeta. We found that ATRA has the ability to differentially and directly induce expression of a truncated isoform of C/EBPbeta, which is an LIP (liver-enriched transcriptional inhibitory protein) that lacks a transactivation domain, and to increase the binding activity of C/EBPbeta-LIP to its response element. Overexpression of C/EBPbeta-LIP negatively regulates the endogenous expression of albumin, as well as the activity of the albumin promoter induced by C/EBP transactivators such as C/EBPalpha and full-length C/EBPbeta. In conclusion, we propose a novel model for down-regulation of the albumin gene, in which ATRA triggers an increase in the translation of C/EBPbeta-LIP that antagonizes C/EBP transactivators by interacting with their binding sites in the albumin promoter.",1
32090549,Acetate-Decorated Tri-Ln(III)-Containing Antimonotungstates with a Tetrahedral {WO,"Four acetate-decorated tri-Ln-substituted trimeric antimonotungstates (AMTs) Na17{(WO4)[Ln(H2O)(Ac)(B-alpha-SbW9O31(OH)2)]3}.50H2O [Ln = Eu(3+) (1), Dy(3+) (2), Ho(3+) (3), or Gd(3+) (4)] were isolated by reaction of Na9[B-alpha-SbW9O33].19.5H2O, Na2WO4.2H2O, and Ln(NO3).6H2O in a HAc/NaAc buffer solution. Interestingly, a tetrahedral {WO4} group plays a significant structure-directing template role in the formation of their polyoxoanions. With regard to luminescence properties, with a change in the excitation wavelength, it is available to switch emission colors from orange to red for 1, blue to green for 2, and blue to yellow for 3. Under the O --> W LMCT excitation, energy transfer from AMT fragments to Eu(3+), Dy(3+), and Ho(3+) ions occurs because Ln(3+) ions can absorb energy from O --> W LMCT emission of AMT segments. The temperature-dependent luminescence behaviors (25-720  degrees C) of 1 together with auxiliary emitting photographs illustrate that the growing emission in the temperature range of 25-100  degrees C results from the loss of lattice water molecules, the decline of emission between 100 and 320  degrees C may occur because crystals become amorphous powders, the slow emission decay (220-320  degrees C) is due to the case that the emission enhancement derived from the removal of water ligands on Eu(3+) ions in some degree compensates for the decline of emission intensity, the sharp decrease in emission (320-520  degrees C) may result from the change in the coordinate environment of Eu(3+) ions, and the weak recovery of emission (620-720  degrees C) may be ascribed to the formation of new phase Na0.5Eu0.5WO4. This work lays a significant foundation for preparing novel POM-based luminescent materials.",0
12874112,Insulator and silencer sequences in the imprinted region of human chromosome 11p15.5,"The imprinting of the genes on human chromosome 11p15.5 is thought to be controlled by two imprinting control regions located in two differentially methylated CpG islands upstream of the H19 gene (H19 DMR) and in intron 10 of the KCNQ1 gene (KvDMR). We have examined sequences in the human 11p15.5 genomic imprinted region for the presence of insulators and silencers using a position- and enhancer-dependent stable transfection assay. We have confirmed the existence of insulators in H19 DMR and discovered two novel insulators in the IGF2 gene. We have also found two novel silencer sequences; one is located in KvDMR, a region that is thought to contain the promoter for the KCNQ1OT1 transcript, and another is in the CDKN1C gene. We have demonstrated binding of CTCF protein in vitro to all the insulator and silencer sequences that we have detected. We discuss the differences in the regulation of imprinting controlled by the two imprinting control regions in chromosome 11p.",1
7657833,Atherogenesis in transgenic mice with human apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein (a),"The engineering of mice that express a human apoB transgene has resulted in animals with high levels of human-like LDL particles and through crosses with human apo(a) transgenics, high levels of human-like lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) particles. In this study, these animals have been used to compare the atherogenic properties of apo(a), LDL, and Lp(a). The presence of the high expressing apoB (apoBH) transgene was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in VLDL-LDL cholesterol (primarily in the LDL fraction) and a 15-fold increase in proximal lesions compared with non-transgenic mice (P < or = 0.0001), while the presence of the low expressing human apoB (apoBL) transgene was not associated with major changes in lipoprotein profiles or increases in aortic lesion size. Examination of aortas of apoBH mice demonstrated lesions along the entire length of the aorta and immunochemical analysis of the lesions revealed features characteristically seen in human lesions including the presence of oxidized lipoproteins, macrophages, and immunoglobulins. Unlike animals with the apoBL transgene, animals with the apo(a) transgene had significant increases in proximal aortic fatty streak lesions compared to nontransgenic control animals (threefold; P < 0.02), while animals with both transgenes, the apo(a)/apo BL double transgenics, had lesions 2.5 times greater than animals expressing the apo(a) transgene alone and eightfold (P < 0.0006) greater than nontransgenic animals. These murine studies demonstrate that marked increases in apoB and LDL resulted in atherosclerotic lesions extending down the aorta which resemble human lesions immunochemically and suggest that apo(a) associated with apoB and lipid may result in a more pro-atherogenic state than when apo(a) is free in plasma.",1
9600235,Mutations of the ATM gene detected in Japanese ataxia-telangiectasia patients: possible preponderance of the two founder mutations 4612del165 and 7883del5,"The ATM (A-T, mutated) gene on human chromosome 11q22.3 has recently been identified as the gene responsible for the human recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). In order to define the types of disease-causing ATM mutations in Japanese A-T patients as well as to look for possible mutational hotspots, reverse-transcribed RNA derived from ten patients belonging to eight unrelated Japanese A-T families was analyzed for mutations by the restriction endonuclease fingerprinting method. As has been reported by others, mutations that lead to exon skipping or premature protein truncation were also predominant in our mutants. Six different mutations were identified on 12 of the 16 alleles examined. Four were deletions involving a loss of a single exon: exon 7, exon 16, exon 33 or exon 35. The others were minute deletions, 4649delA in exon 33 and 7883del5 in exon 55. The mutations 4612del165 and 7883del5 were found in more than two unrelated families; 44% (7 of 16) of the mutant alleles had one of the two mutations. The 4612del165 mutations in three different families were all ascribed to the same T-->A substitution at the splice donor site in intron 33. Microsatellite genotyping around the ATM locus also indicated that a common haplotype was shared by the mutant alleles in both mutations. This suggests that these two founder mutations may be predominant among Japanese ATM mutant alleles.",1
24798416,Statin use is associated with a decreased risk of Barrett's esophagus,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Statins have been associated with a reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, but little is known about their effect on development of Barrett's esophagus. We evaluated the association between statins and risk of Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study among eligible patients scheduled for elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy and patients eligible for screening colonoscopy, recruited from primary care clinics at a Veterans Affairs center. We compared 303 patients with Barrett's esophagus with 2 separate sex-matched control groups: 606 elective endoscopy controls and 303 primary care controls without Barrett's esophagus. Use of statins and other lipid-lowering medications was ascertained by reviewing filled prescriptions in electronic pharmacy records during a 10-year period before the Barrett's esophagus diagnosis date for patients and study endoscopy date for controls. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using conditional multivariable logistic-regression models among 276 patients and 828 controls further matched on age. RESULTS: A smaller proportion of Barrett's esophagus patients filled statin prescriptions (57.4%) than endoscopy controls (64.9%; P = .029) or primary care controls (71.3%; P < .001). Controls had longer durations of statin prescriptions filled than patients (28.6 vs 22.1 months; P = .001). Statin use was associated with a significantly lower risk of Barrett's esophagus (adjusted OR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.38-0.87) compared with the combined control groups. The risk of Barrett's esophagus was especially lower with statin use among obese patients (OR = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.09-0.71), as was the risk for Barrett's esophagus segments >/= 3 cm (OR = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.06-0.30). We found no significant association between Barrett's esophagus and nonstatin lipid-lowering medications (P = .452). CONCLUSIONS: In a case-control study of veterans, statin use was associated with a reduced risk of Barrett's esophagus. The greatest level of risk reduction was observed for obese patients and for long-segment Barrett's esophagus.",0
12060739,p38 is essential for the assembly and stability of macromolecular tRNA synthetase complex: implications for its physiological significance,"Mammalian tRNA synthetases form a macromolecular complex with three nonenzyme factors: p43, p38, and p18. Here we introduced a mutation within the mouse p38 gene to understand its functional significance for the formation of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex. The complex was completely disintegrated by the deficiency of p38. In addition, the protein levels and catalytic activities of the component enzymes and cofactors were severely decreased. A partial truncation of the p38 polypeptide separated the associated components into different subdomains. The mutant mice showed lethality within 2 days of birth. Thus, this work provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, that p38 is essential for the structural integrity of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex and mouse viability.",1

8381212,Bcl-2 blocks apoptosis in cells lacking mitochondrial DNA,"When the mammalian proto-oncogene bcl-2 is overexpressed it can protect various types of cells both from normal and from experimentally induced apoptosis, but the molecular mechanisms involved are unknown. Although the Bcl-2 protein is membrane-associated, its subcellular location is controversial: two studies have suggested that it is mainly associated with the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum, whereas another study has suggested that it is mainly located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The latter study has suggested that Bcl-2 might protect cells from apoptosis by altering mitochondrial function and that mitochondria may be involved in apoptosis. Here we report that human mutant cell lines that lack mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and therefore do not have a functional respiratory chain, can still be induced to die by apoptosis, and that they can be protected from apoptosis by the overexpression of bcl-2, suggesting that neither apoptosis nor the protective effect of bcl-2 depends on mitochondrial respiration. We also show that the Bcl-2 protein in overexpressing cells is associated with the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum, as well as with mitochondria.",1
12571257,Signaling molecules in nonfamilial pulmonary hypertension,"BACKGROUND: Biochemical, genetic, and clinical evidence indicates that smooth-muscle proliferation around small pulmonary vessels is an essential part of the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. Mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) have been linked to familial cases of pulmonary hypertension, but the molecular basis of the common nonfamilial forms is unknown. METHODS: We evaluated the pattern of expression of angiopoietin-1, a protein involved in the recruitment of smooth-muscle cells around blood vessels; TIE2, the endothelial-specific receptor for angiopoietin-1; and bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1A (BMPR1A) and BMPR2 in lung-biopsy specimens from patients with pulmonary hypertension and from normotensive control patients. The effect of angiopoietin-1 on the modulation of BMPR expression was also evaluated in subcultures of human pulmonary arteriolar endothelial cells. RESULTS: The expression of angiopoietin-1 messenger RNA and the protein itself and the phosphorylation of TIE2 were strongly up-regulated in the lungs of patients with various forms of pulmonary hypertension, correlating directly with the severity of disease. A mechanistic link between familial and acquired pulmonary hypertension was demonstrated by the finding that angiopoietin-1 shuts off the expression of BMPR1A, a transmembrane protein required for BMPR2 signaling, in pulmonary arteriolar endothelial cells. Similarly, we found that the expression of BMPR1A was severely reduced in the lungs of patients with various forms of acquired as well as primary nonfamilial pulmonary hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that all forms of pulmonary hypertension are linked by defects in the signaling pathway involving angiopoietin-1, TIE2, BMPR1A, and BMPR2 and consequently identify specific molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.",1

No consistent cytogenetic abnormalities have been found although some features of the syndrome have been reported to be associated with structural abnormalities of distal 15q. More recently it has been shown that about 10% of SRS patients have maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 which suggests the presence of a maternally imprinted gene on chromosome 7 that is associated with SRS. In the majority of patients with normal biparental inheritance of chromosome 7 the same gene could be involved if the paternal copy were deleted or mutated so that it is disabled and the maternal copy is silent because of the imprinting.",0

22763456,Myocardial infarction accelerates atherosclerosis,"During progression of atherosclerosis, myeloid cells destabilize lipid-rich plaques in the arterial wall and cause their rupture, thus triggering myocardial infarction and stroke. Survivors of acute coronary syndromes have a high risk of recurrent events for unknown reasons. Here we show that the systemic response to ischaemic injury aggravates chronic atherosclerosis. After myocardial infarction or stroke, Apoe-/- mice developed larger atherosclerotic lesions with a more advanced morphology. This disease acceleration persisted over many weeks and was associated with markedly increased monocyte recruitment. Seeking the source of surplus monocytes in plaques, we found that myocardial infarction liberated haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from bone marrow niches via sympathetic nervous system signalling. The progenitors then seeded the spleen, yielding a sustained boost in monocyte production. These observations provide new mechanistic insight into atherogenesis and provide a novel therapeutic opportunity to mitigate disease progression.",1

Moreover, several sufficient conditions for cluster synchronization are derived, based on Lyapunov stability theory and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.",0

Genes chosen have either been implicated in schizophrenia, make conceptual sense in the light of the current understanding of the disease, or are located on high-susceptibility chromosome locations. The array screen using prefrontal cortex tissue from 10 schizophrenia and 10 control brains revealed robust up-regulation of apolipoprotein L1 (apo L1) by 2.6-fold. The finding was cross-validated in a blinded quantitative PCR study using prefrontal cortex tissue from the Stanley Foundation brain collection, Bethesda, MD. This collection consists of 15 schizophrenia, 15 bipolar disorder, 15 major depression, and 15 control individuals, all 60 brains being well-matched on conventional parameters, with antipsychotic drug exposure in the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder groups. Significant up-regulation of apo L1 gene expression in schizophrenia was confirmed. Using quantitative PCR, expression profiles of other members of the apo L family (apo L2-L6) were investigated, showing that apo L2 and L4 were highly significantly up-regulated in schizophrenia. Results were then confirmed in an independent set of 20 schizophrenia and 20 control brains from Japan and New Zealand. Apo L proteins belong to the group of high density lipoproteins, with all six apo L genes located in close proximity to each other on chromosome 22q12, a confirmed high-susceptibility locus for schizophrenia and close to the region associated with velocardiofacial syndrome that includes symptoms of schizophrenia.",1

The disorder can cause neurologic and cutaneous abnormalities that can be treated effectively with pharmacologic doses of biotin. We identified 21 mutations that cause profound biotinidase deficiency in 37 symptomatic children (30 different probands and 7 siblings), as well as provide relevant biochemical and clinical information for each child. The two most common mutations (G98:d7i3 and R538C) were found in 31 of 60 alleles (52%), whereas the remainder of the alleles are accounted for by the 19 other unique mutations. Serum samples were available from 18 children, of these 11 had no detectable cross-reacting material (CRM) to antibody prepared against normal human serum biotinidase, three had reduced quantities of CRM and four had normal quantities of CRM in serum. All of these mutations result in complete absence of biotinyl-transferase activity in serum. Two polymorphisms were also identified in normal individuals. It is apparent that a child who inherits any of these mutations, either in the homozygous state or in combination, can develop the clinical features of the disorder if untreated. There are, however, no clear genotype/phenotype correlations that would allow for the prediction of the type, severity, or age of onset of symptoms.",1

Chitin and lignin, byproducts of fishery and plant biomass, show antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity on the nanoscale. Due to their polarities, chitin nanofibril (CN) and nanolignin (NL) can be assembled into micro-complexes, which can be loaded with bioactive factors, such as the glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and CN-NL/GA (CLA) complexes, and can be used to decorate polymer surfaces. This study aims to develop completely bio-based and bioactive meshes intended for wound healing. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)/Poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate-co-3-hydroxydecanoate), P(3HB)/P(3HO-co-3HD) was used to produce films and fiber meshes, to be surface-modified via electrospraying of CN or CLA to reach a uniform distribution. P(3HB)/P(3HO-co-3HD) fibers with desirable size and morphology were successfully prepared and functionalized with CN and CLA using electrospinning and tested in vitro with human keratinocytes. The presence of CN and CLA improved the indirect antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity of the electrospun fiber meshes by downregulating the expression of the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulating human defensin 2 expression. This natural and eco-sustainable mesh is promising in wound healing applications.",0

It has long been recognized that another genetic abnormality, trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), is associated with early and severe development of AD neuropathological lesions. It remains a challenge, however, to understand how these facts relate to the pathological changes in the brains of AD patients. We used computerized image analysis to examine the size distribution of one of the characteristic neuropathological lesions in AD, deposits of A beta peptide in senile plaques (SPs). Surprisingly, we find that a log-normal distribution fits the SP size distribution quite well, motivating a porous model of SP morphogenesis. We then analyzed SP size distribution curves in genotypically defined subgroups of AD patients. The data demonstrate that both apoE epsilon 4/AD and trisomy 21/AD lead to increased amyloid deposition, but by apparently different mechanisms. The size distribution curve is shifted toward larger plaques in trisomy 21/AD, probably reflecting increased A beta production. In apoE epsilon 4/AD, the size distribution is unchanged but the number of SP is increased compared to apoE epsilon 3, suggesting increased probability of SP initiation. These results demonstrate that subgroups of AD patients defined on the basis of molecular characteristics have quantitatively different neuropathological phenotypes.",1
11507063,Suppression of intestinal polyps in Msh2-deficient and non-Msh2-deficient multiple intestinal neoplasia mice by a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor and by a dual cyclooxygenase-1/2 inhibitor,"Epidemiological studies suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents decrease the risk of colorectal cancer. This is believed to be mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. There are two COX isoenzymes, namely the constitutively expressed COX-1 and the inducible COX-2. COX-2 is overexpressed in adenomas and colorectal cancers, and COX-2-specific inhibitors have been shown to inhibit intestinal polyps in Apc(Delta716) mice more effectively than dual COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors such as sulindac. Various Apc knockout mice, including the multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mouse and the Apc(Delta716) mouse, are limited by their lack of large numbers of colonic adenomas and aberrant crypt foci, the putative precursors of large-bowel polyps and cancers. Our DNA mismatch-repair-deficient Min mouse model (Apc+/-Msh2-/-) has genetic features of both familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, and most importantly, rapidly develops numerous small- and large-bowel adenomas, as well as colonic aberrant crypt foci. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of COX inhibitors on intestinal adenomas and colonic aberrant crypt foci in this accelerated polyposis, mismatch-repair-deficient Min mouse model, in addition to a standard Min mouse model. Weanling Apc+/-Msh2-/- and Min mice were fed diets containing no drug, sulindac, or a specific COX-2 inhibitor (MF-tricyclic). Apc+/-Msh2-/- and Min mice were sacrificed after 4 weeks and 5 months on diet, respectively. Apc+/-Msh2-/- mice treated with MF-tricyclic had significantly fewer small-bowel polyps (mean +/- SD, 178 +/- 29) compared with mice on sulindac (278 +/- 80), or control diet (341 +/- 43; P < 0.001). There was no difference in numbers of large-bowel polyps or aberrant crypt foci in mice in the three groups. MF-tricyclic was also effective in reducing both small- and large-bowel polyps in Min mice. Western analysis demonstrated COX-2 expression in both large- and small-bowel polyps from mice of both genotypes. This study demonstrates that a specific COX-2 inhibitor is effective in preventing small-bowel polyps in mismatch-repair-deficient Min mice and both small- and large-bowel polyps in standard Min mice. Therefore, specific COX-2 inhibitors may be useful as chemopreventive and therapeutic agents in humans at risk for colorectal neoplasia.",1

Grafting techniques that optimize function and cosmetic appearance are outlined.",0
15625903,Epidemiology and management of orbital fractures,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Orbital fractures are usually associated with ocular and intracranial injuries. The recent literature on orbital fractures is analyzed with emphasis on epidemiology, assessment, and surgical management. RECENT FINDINGS: In most countries, traffic accidents are the leading cause of orbital fractures. Orbitozygomatic fractures are extremely frequent but rarely addressed in the ophthalmic literature. CT scanning remains the gold standard for assessing orbital fractures, especially with the new CT technology (multislice CT), which has improved the acquisition of coronal images of the orbit without the need for hyperextension of the neck. Several different surgical strategies are used to repair orbital fractures. Porous polyethylene implants continue to be approved by most surgeons. SUMMARY: Orbital fractures are usually part of more complex midfacial trauma. Depending on the main characteristics of the trauma, orbital fractures are managed by different specialists who adopt distinct surgical approaches. Taking into consideration that most complications of these fractures are related to the globe, oculoplastic surgeons in collaboration with other medical specialists are in a prime position to assess and manage these cases.",0
32701089,A carbon fiber ultramicroelectrode as a simple tool to direct antioxidant estimation based on caffeic acid oxidation,"This work describes the construction and evaluation of carbon fiber ultramicroelectrodes (CF-UMEs) in the voltammetric estimation of the antioxidant capacity of wine and grape samples based on caffeic acid (HCAF) oxidation. For this, lab-made CF-UMEs were constructed using an arrangement of six carbon fibers (7 mum diameters individual) assembled in a glass capillary, and caffeic acid (HCAF) was used as a standard solution. By using the most straightforward 2-electrode cell arrangement (the CF-UME as a working electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference/auxiliary electrode), voltammetric measurements of a 1.0 mmol L(-1) HCAF solution were done in the absence of a supporting electrolyte. A sigmoidal voltammetric profile was observed in CF-UMEs caused by a more effective mass transport by radial diffusion, which leads to a rapid formation of the diffusion layer. Reproducibility studies for different 6-fiber electrodes manually constructed in different batches showed an RSD of less than 5%. For the same electrode surface, a variation of 2.7% was observed. Under optimized conditions, a linear relationship between anodic peak current and HCAF concentration from 3.0 to 500 mumol L(-1) with a sensitivity of 12 muA L mol(-1) was reached. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were calculated to be 0.41 and 1.26 mumol L(-1), respectively. The proposed electrochemical method was applied in the estimation of the antioxidant capacity in three different wine samples as well as in green and red grapes. Concordant and satisfactory results by comparison with a proper method were obtained, which suggests that the proposed sensor can be successfully applied for direct analysis of wine and grape samples by estimation of HCAF content.",0

We recently confirmed that angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2) is a potent angiogenic and proinflammatory factor in the cornea, and we have produced a single-stranded proline-modified short hairpin anti-ANGPTL2 RNA interference molecule that is carried in a lipid nanoparticle (ANGPTL2 Li-pshRNA) for topical application. In this study, we have further examined the topical delivery and anti-ANGPTL2 activity of this molecule and have found that fluorescence-labeled ANGPTL2 Li-pshRNA eye drops can penetrate all layers of the cornea and that ANGPTL2 mRNA expression was dramatically inhibited in both epithelium and stroma at 12 and 24 hours after administration. We also examined the inhibitory effect of ANGPTL2 Li-pshRNA on CNV in a mouse chemical injury model and found that the area of angiogenesis was significantly decreased in corneas treated with ANGPTL2 Li-pshRNA eye drops compared to controls. Together, these findings indicate that this modified RNA interference agent is clinically viable in a topical formulation for use against CNV. ",0

Estrogen sales doubled and tripled in the mid-1960s to mid-1970s, until 1975, when reports of increased endometrial cancer in estrogen users resulted in a dramatic decline. Estrogen use increased again, with evidence of protective effects of progestins on estrogen-induced endometrial changes, combined with a 1982 report that Premarin (conjugated estrogen tablets; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) retained bone mass and a 1984 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference on Osteoporosis statement that estrogens were the most effective means for preventing bone loss. Despite conflicting reports in 1985 regarding the relation between estrogens and coronary heart disease (CHD), many published observations of reduced CHD risk in estrogen users--reinforced by clinical trial findings in 1995 of favorable lipoprotein changes in women assigned to CEE with or without a progestin--promoted increased use through the 1990s. By 2001, approximately 15 million US women were using estrogen therapy, with or without progestins. The 2002 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) report of greater harm than benefit of combined CEE plus a progestin resulted in a precipitous decrease in estrogen and progestin use and a serious reevaluation of menopausal hormone therapy, as well as increased interest in alternative approaches to managing menopausal symptoms, including use of ",0
12353035,Pleiotropic defects in lymphocyte activation caused by caspase-8 mutations lead to human immunodeficiency,"Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is controlled by aspartate-specific cysteine proteases called caspases. In the immune system, apoptosis counters the proliferation of lymphocytes to achieve a homeostatic balance, which allows potent responses to pathogens but avoids autoimmunity. The CD95 (Fas, Apo-1) receptor triggers lymphocyte apoptosis by recruiting Fas-associated death domain (FADD), caspase-8 and caspase-10 proteins into a death-inducing signalling complex. Heterozygous mutations in CD95, CD95 ligand or caspase-10 underlie most cases of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), a human disorder that is characterized by defective lymphocyte apoptosis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and autoimmunity. Mutations in caspase-8 have not been described in ALPS, and homozygous caspase-8 deficiency causes embryonic lethality in mice. Here we describe a human kindred with an inherited genetic deficiency of caspase-8. Homozygous individuals manifest defective lymphocyte apoptosis and homeostasis but, unlike individuals affected with ALPS, also have defects in their activation of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, which leads to immunodeficiency. Thus, caspase-8 deficiency in humans is compatible with normal development and shows that caspase-8 has a postnatal role in immune activation of naive lymphocytes.",1

6432779,Abnormal lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activation by a human apolipoprotein A-I variant in which a single lysine residue is deleted,"An apolipoprotein (apo) A-I variant that has a relative charge of -1 compared to normal apo-A-I on isoelectric focusing gels has been identified in five unrelated families as a result of screening a large number of individuals. The cause of the electrophoretic abnormality has been examined by analyzing the variant apo-A-I structure. The evidence suggests that a single amino acid, lysine 107, has been deleted in the variant apo-A-I of all affected individuals studied from these families, with the remainder of the variant apo-A-I sequence being unaffected. The deletion of this single basic amino acid residue is sufficient to account for the charge difference between the variant and normal apo-A-I as seen on isoelectric focusing gels. This variant, previously referred to as A-I-Marburg or A-I-Munster-2, can now be designated by the structural abnormality apo-A-I(Lys107----0). The evidence from extensive pedigree analysis suggests the likelihood that the deletion mutant gene is allelic to the normal apo-A-I gene. At the same time, the kindred analyses have failed to yield a lipid abnormality that can be unequivocally related to the presence of this deletion mutant of apo-A-I. However, all subjects expressing apo-A-I(Lys107----0) also express normal apo-A-I, so that any abnormality caused by the variant apo-A-I might be adequately compensated for by the normal apo-A-I. To examine directly the functional consequence of the lysine deletion, the isolated variant was tested in vitro for its ability to activate lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, the principal cholesterol-esterifying enzyme in plasma. It was found that apo-A-I(Lys107----0) is deficient in its ability to activate lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, having only 40-60% of the cofactor activity of normal apo-A-I. The cofactor activity of the pro-apo-A-I component of the variant was also reduced to about 60% of either normal A-I or normal pro-apo-A-I. The functional defect is probably related to a disruption in the secondary and/or tertiary structure of the protein caused by the deletion of lysine 107 in the primary structure.",1
19620979,A mouse model of ATR-Seckel shows embryonic replicative stress and accelerated aging,"Although DNA damage is considered a driving force for aging, the nature of the damage that arises endogenously remains unclear. Replicative stress, a source of endogenous DNA damage, is prevented primarily by the ATR kinase. We have developed a mouse model of Seckel syndrome characterized by a severe deficiency in ATR. Seckel mice show high levels of replicative stress during embryogenesis, when proliferation is widespread, but this is reduced to marginal amounts in postnatal life. In spite of this decrease, adult Seckel mice show accelerated aging, which is further aggravated in the absence of p53. Together, these results support a model whereby replicative stress, particularly in utero, contributes to the onset of aging in postnatal life, and this is balanced by the replicative stress-limiting role of the checkpoint proteins ATR and p53.",1

Five measurements, four horizontal and one vertical, defining the framework were taken from the skin and bony surface of the face in the maturation period (16-20 years) and in 10-year age categories of adulthood (21-90 years). As well, the thickness of the soft-tissue cover between these two anatomical levels was measured. The categories between 21 and 40 years represented early adulthood, those between 41 and 70 years represented middle adulthood, and those between 71 and 90 years represented late adulthood. The forehead width in both sexes increased significantly on the skin and bony surface from the maturation period to early adulthood. In middle adulthood, the changes were significant only sporadically. In late adulthood, the upper and lower jaw showed a harmonious change with age, mostly increasing on both the skin and bony surface. The face width proved to be the most stable measurement and had the thinnest soft-tissue cover. No consistent pattern emerged during adulthood in increases or decreases within the facial framework; however, an unexpected harmony was noted between the values of the measurements in early and late adulthood in both sexes on both the skin and bony surface. The thickness of the soft-tissue cover at the bony landmarks was greatest in the midface, with a moderately decreasing tendency in both sexes. In the lower jaw, the soft tissue showed significant increases in thickness in early adulthood and moderate to large decreases in late adulthood. Anthropometric analysis of the facial framework in adulthood marks only the first step in establishing the morphological changes of the aging face. Quantitative evaluation of changes within the facial framework of the aging population must be carried out in more detail. Increased worldwide migration results in a mixing of people of various racial/ethnic origins and necessitates a general anthropometric analysis of the aging face to provide more reliable guidelines for therapy.",0
27576163,Epidemiological profile of patients seen in the pre-anesthetic assessment clinic of a university hospital,"OBJECTIVE: Assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of surgical patients seen in the Pre-anesthetic Assessment Clinic of the Hospital Universitario Gaffree e Guinle (APA/HUGG), in order to assist in the pursuit for quality, effectiveness, and resource rationalization of hospital management. METHOD: Cross-sectional descriptive study with 491 patients undergoing elective surgery, treated at APA/HUGG Clinic from March to December 2014. The following variables were assessed: sex, age, BMI, smoking status, associated diseases, classification of MET's and ASA, presence of decompensated disease, medical associated appointments interconsultation, specialty and surgical risk, history of prior anesthetic-surgical procedure, and complications. RESULTS: There was a predominance of female (64.8%) and overweight patients (55.9%), aged 18-59 years. The prevalence of associated diseases was high (71.3%), with hypertension pressure prevailing (50.1%). Most patients had clinically compensated morbidity (96.3%) and long-term use of medication (77.4%). Regarding the surgical characteristics, the most frequent specialty was general and medium risk surgeries. The analysis of the characteristics by age showed that the elderly have more associated diseases and long-term use of medication, in addition to predominance of ASA II-III. CONCLUSION: The epidemiological profile of surgical patients seen at the APA/HUGG was female, age 18-59 years, overweight, with associated diseases, long-term use of medication, without clinical decompensation, ASA II and MET's >/=4. Knowledge of the clinical characteristics of surgical patients is critical to schedule the perioperative care, allowing the improvement of quality and safety in anesthesia and surgery.",0
32232123,Sex Differences in Cardiac AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Following Exhaustive Exercise,"Ischemic heart disease presents with significant differences between sexes. Endurance exercise protects the heart against ischemic disease and also distinctly impacts male and female patients through unidentified mechanisms, though some evidence implicates 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The purpose of this investigation was to assess the impact of training and sex on cardiac AMPK activation following exhaustive exercise. AMPK activation was measured in trained and sedentary mice of both sexes. Trained mice ran on a treadmill at progressively increasing speeds and duration for 12 weeks. Trained and sedentary mice of both sexes were euthanized immediately following exhaustive exercise and compared to sedentary controls. Endurance training elicited adaptations indicative of aerobic adaptation including higher max running velocities and cardiac hypertrophy with no differences between males and females. AMPK activity was higher in male compared to females, and trained exhibited higher AMPK activity compared to sedentary mice. In response to training, male mice activated AMPK more robustly than female mice. Chronic exercise training increases the ability to activate cardiac AMPK in response to exhaustive exercise in a sex-specific manner. Understanding the interaction between exercise and sex is vital for use of exercise as medicine for heart disease in both men and women.",0
20966215,Peripherally applied Abeta-containing inoculates induce cerebral beta-amyloidosis,The intracerebral injection of beta-amyloid-containing brain extracts can induce cerebral beta-amyloidosis and associated pathologies in susceptible hosts.

15879125,Protective immunity to genital herpes simplex [correction of simpex] virus type 2 infection is mediated by T-bet,"We show, for the first time, that the transcription factor T-bet, which is implicated in IFN-gamma production, is required for the induction of vaccine-induced antiviral immune protection. T-bet was found to be important in both the innate and acquired immune protection against genital HSV-2 infection. T-bet(-/-) and T-bet(+/+) mice were infected vaginally with HSV-2 and examined daily for disease and mortality. T-bet(-/-) mice had significantly higher virus titers than T-bet(+/+) mice following a primary HSV-2 infection, and succumbed significantly earlier to the infection. This result was associated with an impaired NK cell cytotoxic capacity and NK cell-mediated IFN-gamma production in the T-bet(-/-) mice. To assess the induction of acquired antiviral immune protection, mice were vaccinated with an attenuated virus before infection. Vaccinated T-bet(-/-) mice could not control viral replication following an HSV-2 challenge and had significantly higher virus titers and mortality rates than vaccinated T-bet(+/+) mice that remained healthy. The impaired acquired immune protection in T-bet(-/-) mice was associated with a significantly decreased HSV-2-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity response and a significantly reduced HSV-2-specific IFN-gamma production from CD4(+) T cells. However, T-bet deficiency did not impair either the IFN-gamma production or the cytotoxic capacity of HSV-2-specific CD8(+) T cells. We conclude that T-bet plays a crucial role in both the innate defense and the generation of vaccine-induced immunity against genital HSV-2 infection in mice.",1
1733867,Long-range physical map of the Ly-6 complex: mapping the Ly-6 multigene family by field-inversion and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis,"The Ly-6 proteins are encoded by a recently identified multigene family. Much attention has been focused on these proteins because they may be involved in lymphocyte activation, and expression of some of them occurs at critical times in the differentiation of lymphocytes. These features make it important to investigate and to characterize further this family of molecules and the genes that encode them. To aid our investigation of these issues, we have constructed a physical map of the entire Ly-6 complex in the C57BL/6 murine genome using the combined techniques of field-inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE), phage and cosmid genomic library screening, and two-dimensional DNA electrophoresis. This map spans approximately 1600 kb, and comparison of the FIGE map and cosmids indicates that most of the Ly-6 complex has been isolated in the cosmid clones.",1
12356871,"CD40, an extracellular receptor for binding and uptake of Hsp70-peptide complexes","Tumor and viral antigens elicit a potent immune response by heat shock protein-dependent uptake of antigenic peptide with subsequent presentation by MHC I. Receptors on antigen-presenting cells that specifically bind and internalize a heat shock protein-peptide complex have not yet been identified. Here, we show that cells expressing CD40, a cell surface protein crucial for B cell function and autoimmunity, specifically bind and internalize human Hsp70 with bound peptide. Binding of Hsp70-peptide complex to the exoplasmic domain of CD40 is mediated by the NH(2)-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of Hsp70 in its ADP state. The Hsp70 cochaperone Hip, but not the bacterial Hsp70 homologue DnaK, competes formation of the Hsp70-CD40 complex. Binding of Hsp70-ADP to CD40 is strongly increased in the presence of Hsp70 peptide substrate, and induces signaling via p38. We suggest that CD40 is a cochaperone-like receptor mediating the uptake of exogenous Hsp70-peptide complexes by macrophages and dendritic cells.",1

The pH of crystallization is generally reported as that of the buffer; however, the true pH has been found to be as many as four pH units away. Measurement of pH with a meter is time-consuming and requires the reformatting of the crystallization solution. To overcome this, a high-throughput method for pH determination of buffered solutions has been developed with results comparable to those of a pH meter. ",0
27220836,Femoral and sciatic nerve block for knee arthroscopy in a patient with acute intermittent porphyria,Acute intermittent porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder that results from a partial deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase and that causes very severe symptoms. Attacks may be triggered by a series of drugs and by other factors that the anesthesiologist should be aware of in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Our objective is to review anesthetic considerations in acute intermittent porphyria. We present the case of a patient diagnosed with acute intermittent porphyria who was scheduled for knee arthroscopy. The anesthetic technique used was a femoral and sciatic nerve block under sedation with an infusion of remifentanil. The surgery proceeded without incident and the patient was discharged home after 24h. We consider the use of a peripheral plexus block of the lower limb to have been the safest anesthetic technique for this patient. ,0
15024729,Genomic rearrangements in the CFTR gene: extensive allelic heterogeneity and diverse mutational mechanisms,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR/ABCC7). Despite the extensive and enduring efforts of many CF researchers over the past 14 years, up to 30% of disease alleles still remain to be identified in some populations. It has long been suggested that gross genomic rearrangements could account for these unidentified alleles. To date, however, only a few large deletions have been found in the CFTR gene and only three have been fully characterized. Here, we report the first systematic screening of the 27 exons of the CFTR gene for large genomic rearrangements, by means of the quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF). A well-characterized cohort of 39 classical CF patients carrying at least one unidentified allele (after extensive and complete screening of the CFTR gene by both denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography) participated in this study. Using QMPSF, some 16% of the previously unidentified CF mutant alleles were identified and characterized, including five novel mutations (one large deletion and four indels). The breakpoints of these five mutations were precisely determined, enabling us to explore the underlying mechanisms of mutagenesis. Although non-homologous recombination may be invoked to explain all five complex lesions, each mutation appears to have arisen through a different mechanism. One of the indels was highly unusual in that it involved the insertion of a short 41 bp sequence with partial homology to a retrotranspositionally-competent LINE-1 element. The insertion of this ultra-short LINE-1 element (dubbed a ",1

21658343,"Treatment-resistant depression: prevalence, risk factors, and treatment strategies","Full symptomatic remission is the optimal outcome for patients with major depression. Unfortunately, initial antidepressant efficacy is limited to partial response for many patients. Incomplete remission of depressive symptoms is associated with increased risk of relapse, decreased functioning in work and social settings, and increased risk of suicide. Factors that increase the likelihood of treatment resistance include chronicity, severe symptomatology, and comorbid illnesses. Strategies to manage patients who do not respond to an initial course of antidepressant medication include optimizing the dose, switching antidepressants, or adding adjunctive treatment (ie, psychotherapy or a second medication). Augmentation may be the preferred strategy for improving response if tolerability to the original agent is acceptable and the initial medication has had some beneficial effects. Tracking patients' depressive symptoms with standardized measurement tools during the course of treatment is necessary for identifying incomplete remission and providing appropriate treatment modification.",0
1722323,Spectrum of mutations in aspartylglucosaminuria,"Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of aspartylglucosaminidase. We have earlier reported a single missense mutation (Cys163----Ser) to be responsible for 98% of the AGU alleles in the isolated Finnish population, which contains about 90% of the reported AGU patients. Here we describe the spectrum of 10 AGU mutations found in unrelated patients of non-Finnish origin. Since 11 out of 12 AGU patients were homozygotes, consanguinity has to be a common denominator in most AGU families. The mutations were distributed over the entire coding region of the aspartylglucosaminidase cDNA, except in the carboxyl-terminal 17-kDa subunit in which they were clustered within a 46-amino acid region. Based on the character of the mutations, most of them are prone to affect the folding and stability and not to directly affect the active site of the aspartylglucosaminidase enzyme.",1
18164693,Topical transduction of superoxide dismutase mediated by HIV-1 Tat protein transduction domain ameliorates 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced inflammation in mice,"A domain (RKKRRQRRR) derived from HIV-1 Tat is one of the most efficient protein transduction domains (PTD) for delivering macromolecules including proteins into cells and tissues. Antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase are major cellular defenses against oxidative stress which results in various diseases including skin inflammation. In this study, we examined the effect of SOD fused with HIV-1 Tat PTD (Tat-SOD) on TPA-induced skin inflammation in mice. Topical application of Tat-SOD to mice ears 1h after TPA application once a day for 3 days dose-dependently inhibited TPA-induced ear edema in mice. Topical application on mice ears of Tat-SOD also suppressed TPA-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 as well as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and production of PGE(2). Furthermore, topical application of Tat-SOD resulted in significant reduction in activation of NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in the mice ears treated with TPA. These data demonstrates that Tat-SOD inhibits TPA-induced inflammation in mice by reducing the levels of expression of proinflammatory cytokines and enzymes regulated by the NF-kappaB and MAPK and can be used as a therapeutic agent against skin inflammation related to oxidative damage.",0
8688083,Protection against atherogenesis in mice mediated by human apolipoprotein A-IV,"Apolipoproteins are protein constituents of plasma lipid transport particles. Human apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) was expressed in the liver of C57BL/6 mice and mice deficient in apoE, both of which are prone to atherosclerosis, to investigate whether apoA-IV protects against this disease. In transgenic C57BL/6 mice on an atherogenic diet, the serum concentration of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased by 35 percent, whereas the concentration of endogenous apoA-I decreased by 29 percent, relative to those in transgenic mice on a normal diet. Expression of human apoA-IV in apoE-deficient mice on a normal diet resulted in an even more severe atherogenic lipoprotein profile, without affecting the concentration of HDL cholesterol, than that in nontransgenic apoE-deficient mice. However, transgenic mice of both backgrounds showed a substantial reduction in the size of atherosclerotic lesions. Thus, apoA-IV appears to protect against atherosclerosis by a mechanism that does not involve an increase in HDL cholesterol concentration.",1
29164382,CT texture features of liver parenchyma for predicting development of metastatic disease and overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To determine if identifiable hepatic textural features are present at abdominal CT in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) prior to the development of CT-detectable hepatic metastases. METHODS: Four filtration-histogram texture features (standard deviation, skewness, entropy and kurtosis) were extracted from the liver parenchyma on portal venous phase CT images at staging and post-treatment surveillance. Surveillance scans corresponded to the last scan prior to the development of CT-detectable CRC liver metastases in 29 patients (median time interval, 6 months), and these were compared with interval-matched surveillance scans in 60 CRC patients who did not develop liver metastases. Predictive models of liver metastasis-free survival and overall survival were built using regularised Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Texture features did not significantly differ between cases and controls. For Cox models using all features as predictors, all coefficients were shrunk to zero, suggesting no association between any CT texture features and outcomes. Prognostic indices derived from entropy features at surveillance CT incorrectly classified patients into risk groups for future liver metastases (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: On surveillance CT scans immediately prior to the development of CRC liver metastases, we found no evidence suggesting that changes in identifiable hepatic texture features were predictive of their development. KEY POINTS: * No correlation between liver texture features and metastasis-free survival was observed. * Liver texture features incorrectly classified patients into risk groups for liver metastases. * Standardised texture analysis workflows need to be developed to improve research reproducibility.",0

Method and material: Class II cavities with dimension 1.5 +0 .25 pulpal depth and 4 +/- 0.25 mm buccolingual width/.were prepared on proximal surfaces extracted human molars or premolar with affected/sound dentine on gingival margin. The etching priming and restorations were done in prepared samples as per manufacture directions. The samples were divided in 2 groups depending on use of ribbond inserts in composite restorative material. Samples were finished, stored in distilled water and then thermocycled manually and then sectioned longitudinally through the restorations. The marginal adaptation was evaluated using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Result: The result showed that there was a definite gap all along the interface between caries affected dentine and the composite material in both the groups. The bigger gap was present in group II compared to group I.",0

26081716,Interplay between the genetic clades of Micromonas and their viruses in the Western English Channel,"The genus Micromonas comprises distinct genetic clades that commonly dominate eukaryotic phytoplankton community from polar to tropical waters. This phytoplankter is also recurrently infected by abundant and genetically diverse prasinoviruses. Here we report on the interplay between prasinoviruses and Micromonas with regard to the genetic diversity of this host. For 1 year, we monitored the abundance of three clades of Micromonas and their viruses in the Western English Channel, both in the environment using clade-specific probes and flow cytometry, and in the laboratory using clonal strains of Micromonas clades to assay for their viruses by plaque-forming units. We showed that the seasonal fluctuations of Micromonas clades were closely mirrored by the abundance of their corresponding viruses, indicating that the members of Micromonas genus are susceptible to viral infection, regardless of their genetic affiliation. The characterization of 45 viral isolates revealed that Micromonas clades are attacked by specific virus populations, which exhibit distinctive clade specificity, life strategies and genetic diversity. However, some viruses can also cross-infect different host clades, suggesting a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer within the Micromonas genus. This study provides novel insights into the impact of viral infection for the ecology and evolution of the prominent phytoplankter Micromonas. ",0
9770546,Memory-enhancing effects of secreted forms of the beta-amyloid precursor protein in normal and amnestic mice,"When administered intracerebroventricularly to mice performing various learning tasks involving either short-term or long-term memory, secreted forms of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APPs751 and APPs695) have potent memory-enhancing effects and block learning deficits induced by scopolamine. The memory-enhancing effects of APPs were observed over a wide range of extremely low doses (0.05-5,000 pg intracerebroventricularly), blocked by anti-APPs antisera, and observed when APPs was administered either after the first training session in a visual discrimination or a lever-press learning task or before the acquisition trial in an object recognition task. APPs had no effect on motor performance or exploratory activity. APPs695 and APPs751 were equally effective in the object recognition task, suggesting that the memory-enhancing effect of APPs does not require the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain. These data suggest an important role for APPss on memory processes.",1

Electron microscopic analysis of RNA:DNA hybrids, nucleotide sequence, identification of a polymorphic MspI site, and general structural organization of apolipoprotein genes","Three cloned apolipoprotein A-II genes were isolated from a human genomic cosmid library constructed in our laboratory. An approximately 3-kilobase HindIII insert containing the entire gene was analyzed by RNA:DNA hybridization and electron microscopy. The apo-A-II gene was found to consist of 4 exons and 3 intervening sequences (IVS), and the lengths of each exon and IVS were estimated by direct observation of the hybrids. The entire approximately 3-kilobase HindIII insert was sequenced. The 5' end of the gene was determined by primer extension. The DNA sequence confirms the presence of 4 exons and 3 IVS: exon 1, 34 nucleotides; exon 2, 76 nucleotides; exon 3, 133 nucleotides; exon 4, 230 nucleotides; IVS-I, 169 nucleotides; IVS-II, 299 nucleotides; and IVS-III, 396 nucleotides.

25927288,Muscular and functional effects of partitioning exercising muscle mass in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Low-load, high-repetitive single-limb resistance training may increase limb muscle function and functional exercise capacity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) while minimizing the occurrence of limiting exertional symptoms. Whether high-repetitive single-limb resistance training would perform better than high-repetitive two-limb resistance training is unknown. In addition, the mechanisms underlying possible benefits of high-repetitive resistance training has not been investigated. The aims of this study are to compare single versus two-limb high-repetitive resistance training in patients with COPD and to investigate mechanisms of action of these training modalities. METHODS/DESIGN: This trial is a prospective, assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial. The participants are patients with stable severe to very severe COPD who are older than 40 years of age and healthy controls. The intervention is single-limb, high-repetitive, resistance training with elastic bands, three times/week for 8 weeks. The control is two-limb high-repetitive resistance training with elastic bands, three times/week for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes is change in the 6-min walking distance after 8 weeks of single-limb or two-limb high-repetitive resistance training. The secondary outcomes are changes in limb muscle strength and endurance capacity, key protein involved in quadriceps anabolic/catabolic signalization, fiber-type distribution and capillarization, subjective dyspnea and muscle fatigue, muscle oxygenation, cardiorespiratory demand and health-related quality-of-life after 8 weeks of single-limb or two-limb high-repetitive resistance training. The acute effects of single-limb versus two-limb high-repetitive resistance training on contractile fatigue, exercise stimulus (the product of number of repetition and load), subjective dyspnea and muscle fatigue, muscle oxygenation, and cardiorespiratory demand during upper and lower limb exercises will also be investigated in patients with COPD and healthy controls. Randomization will be performed using a random number generator by a person independent of the recruitment process, using 1:1 allocation to the intervention and the control group using random block sizes. BLINDING: All outcome assessors will be blinded to group assignment. DISCUSSION: The results of this project will provide important information to help developing and implementing customized exercise training programs for patients with COPD.

10780262,"Eukaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) genes: human polymorphisms, and recommended nomenclature based on divergent evolution and chromosomal mapping","As currently being performed with an increasing number of superfamilies, a standardized gene nomenclature system is proposed here, based on divergent evolution, using multiple alignment analysis of all 86 eukaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) amino-acid sequences known at this time. The ALDHs represent a superfamily of NAD(P)(+)-dependent enzymes having similar primary structures that oxidize a wide spectrum of endogenous and exogenous aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. To date, a total of 54 animal, 15 plant, 14 yeast, and three fungal ALDH genes or cDNAs have been sequenced. These ALDHs can be divided into a total of 18 families (comprising 37 subfamilies), and all nonhuman ALDH genes are named here after the established human ALDH genes, when possible. An ALDH protein from one gene family is defined as having approximately < or = 40% amino-acid identity to that from another family. Two members of the same subfamily exhibit approximately > or = 60% amino-acid identity and are expected to be located at the same subchromosomal site. For naming each gene, it is proposed that the root symbol 'ALDH' denoting 'aldehyde dehydrogenase' be followed by an Arabic number representing the family and, when needed, a letter designating the subfamily and an Arabic number denoting the individual gene within the subfamily; all letters are capitalized in all mammals except mouse and fruit fly, e.g. 'human ALDH3A1 (mouse, Drosophila Aldh3a1).' It is suggested that the Human Gene Nomenclature Guidelines (http://++www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/guidelines.h tml) be used for all species other than mouse and Drosophila. Following these guidelines, the gene is italicized, whereas the corresponding cDNA, mRNA, protein or enzyme activity is written with upper-case letters and without italics, e.g. 'human, mouse or Drosophila ALDH3A1 cDNA, mRNA, or activity'. If an orthologous gene between species cannot be identified with certainty, sequential naming of these genes will be carried out in chronological order as they are reported to us. In addition, 20 human ALDH variant alleles that have been reported to date are listed herein and are recommended to be given numbers (or a number plus a capital letter) following an asterisk (e.g. 'ALDH3A2*2, ALDH2*4C'). It is anticipated that this eukaryotic ALDH gene nomenclature system will be extended to include bacterial genes within the next 2 years and that this nomenclature system will require updating on a regular basis; an ALDH Web site has been established for this purpose (http://++www.uchsc.edu/sp./sp./alcdbase/a ldhcov.html) and will serve as a medium for interaction amongst colleagues in this field.",1
26349398,Exendin-4 Loaded Nanoparticles with a Lipid Shell and Aqueous Core Containing Micelles for Enhanced Intestinal Absorption,"The purpose of this study was to formulate nanoparticles with an elaborate structure for oral delivery of exendin-4 using a simple preparation process. The nanoparticles possessed a mixed lipid shell and an aqueous core which contained drug-loaded micelles. Formulation was optimized by a central composite design and the structure of the nanoparticles was validated. The efficacy for delivery of exendin-4 was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The drug encapsulation efficiency of the nanoparticles reached 97.7%. The nanoparticles greatly enhanced the cellular uptake and transport of encapsulated exendin-4 in vitro. The in situ study showed that exendin-4 could be transported across the epithelium into intestinal capillaries, while the lipid materials largely remained in the epithelium. Pharmacodynamic studies in diabetic KKAy mice demonstrated that the exendin-4-loaded nanoparticles exhibited a marked hypoglycemia effect with a pharmacological availability of 12.7% after intestinal administration.",0
14978584,Mental stimulation strategy affects postural control,"Recent studies have proposed that the mental rotation of body parts can be accomplished by calling upon visual and somatomotor resources which, at a functional level, would correspond to different routes toward a single solution [1]. In this study, we investigated the effect of somato-motor and visual strategies upon the mental simulation of a task that involved postural adjustments. Subjects were asked to stand up on a vertical force platform and instructed either to 1) rest during 20 s (ST), 2) count mentally from 1 to 15 (CO), 3) imagine themselves executing a bilateral plantar flexion 15 times (IM), and 4) execute the same movement 15 times (EX). They were further classified as visual or somato-motor dominant, according to the strategy reported as adopted to perform IM. Mental chronometry showed that mean time spent in IM matched that of EX, differing from CO for both groups. Index of stabilometric modulation during IM was computed by reference to CO. Higher index values for area and amplitude of displacement in the antero posterior (y) axis were found for the somato-motor as compared to the visual group. The stabilometric departure found for visual and somato-motor dominant subjects suggests that each imagery mode activates a distinct subset of cortical and subcortical brain networks.",0
12297987,Mutations in ANKH cause chondrocalcinosis,"Chondrocalcinosis (CC) is a common cause of joint pain and arthritis that is caused by the deposition of calcium-containing crystals within articular cartilage. Although most cases are sporadic, rare familial forms have been linked to human chromosomes 8 (CCAL1) or 5p (CCAL2) (Baldwin et al. 1995; Hughes et al. 1995; Andrew et al. 1999). Here, we show that two previously described families with CCAL2 have mutations in the human homolog of the mouse progressive ankylosis gene (ANKH). One of the human mutations results in the substitution of a highly conserved amino acid residue within a predicted transmembrane segment. The other creates a new ATG start site that adds four additional residues to the ANKH protein. Both mutations segregate completely with disease status and are not found in control subjects. In addition, 1 of 95 U.K. patients with sporadic CC showed a deletion of a single codon in the ANKH gene. The same change was found in a sister who had bilateral knee replacement for osteoarthritis. Each of the three human mutations was reconstructed in a full-length ANK expression construct previously shown to regulate pyrophosphate levels in cultured cells in vitro. All three of the human mutations showed significantly more activity than a previously described nonsense mutation that causes severe hydroxyapatite mineral deposition and widespread joint ankylosis in mice. These results suggest that small sequence changes in ANKH are one cause of CC and joint disease in humans. Increased ANK activity may explain the different types of crystals commonly deposited in human CCAL2 families and mutant mice and may provide a useful pharmacological target for treating some forms of human CC.",1
20720015,"Structure and functional analysis of LptC, a conserved membrane protein involved in the lipopolysaccharide export pathway in Escherichia coli","LptC is a conserved bitopic inner membrane protein from Escherichia coli involved in the export of lipopolysaccharide from its site of synthesis in the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer membrane. LptC forms a complex with the ATP-binding cassette transporter, LptBFG, which is thought to facilitate the extraction of lipopolysaccharide from the inner membrane and release it into a translocation pathway that includes the putative periplasmic chaperone LptA. Cysteine modification experiments established that the catalytic domain of LptC is oriented toward the periplasm. The structure of the periplasmic domain is described at a resolution of 2.2-A from x-ray crystallographic data. The periplasmic domain of LptC consists of a twisted boat structure with two beta-sheets in apposition to each other. The beta-sheets contain seven and eight antiparallel beta-strands, respectively. This structure bears a high degree of resemblance to the crystal structure of LptA. Like LptA, LptC binds lipopolysaccharide in vitro. In vitro, LptA can displace lipopolysaccharide from LptC (but not vice versa), consistent with their locations and their proposed placement in a unidirectional export pathway.",0
11840511,"Molecular analysis, mutation screening, and association study of adenylate cyclase type 9 gene (ADCY9) in mood disorders","Chromosome 16p13 has been shown to display modest linkage signals for mood disorders in a number of studies. An interesting candidate gene in this region is the adenylate cyclase (AC) type 9 gene (ADCY9). ACs are critical in neuronal signaling, and perturbation of brain AC activity has been reported in mood disorder postmortem brains. ACs may also act as targets of antidepressants. Two distinct length transcripts for the ADCY9 gene have been reported, but molecular mechanisms are unknown. To investigate the potential role of ADCY9 in mood disorders, we clarified alternative poly(A) sites for the two mRNA species, delineated the exon-intron structure, and screened the gene for genetic variants. The two transcripts encoded by ADCY9 shared the first 10 exons, but exon 11 was shorter in one of the mRNA species. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms, including a missense mutation and one polymorphic microsatellite repeat in the 3'-UTR, were identified. However, a case-control study using the missense polymorphism, 2316A>G (Ile772Met), and the tetranucleotide repeat (TTTA)n showed no significant association with mood disorders in Japanese samples. The DNA polymorphisms detected in this study can be tested in other ethnic samples and/or other psychiatric diseases.",1
20810257,Management of oncological and iatrogenic urinary incontinence in malignant disease,"Urinary incontinence can have a major effect on quality of life, and may contribute to overall disability in patients with abdominal and pelvic malignancy. It can lead to isolation and depression, and delay rehabilitation and integration within family and society. With prompt assessment and correct management, urinary leakage can be controlled and many of the problems associated with urinary incontinence can be prevented to the patient's satisfaction. In oncological patients, this is best achieved in a multidisciplinary approach. This involves close co-operation between the oncologist, urologist, specialist nurses and individual patient, setting realistic expectations, guided by the patient's views and wishes.

31788815,What do patients want? Surgical informed-consent and patient-centered care - An augmented model of information disclosure,"The ideal moral standard for surgical informed-consent calls upon surgeons to carry out a disclosure dialogue with patients so they have as full as possible an understanding of the procedure before they sign the informed-consent form. This study is the first to empirically explore patient preferences regarding disclosure dialogue. Twelve Israelis who underwent life-saving surgeries participated in a narrative study. Three themes emerged from the analysis: objectification of patients, anxiety provoking processes and information, and lack of information that was essential for patients. Findings contribute to existing debates among surgeons regarding the scope and importance of some disclosure components. Analysis led to our formulation of an augmented subjective model of information disclosure that participants prefer, which extends beyond the immediate present of the surgery to the period after discharge, and until return to routine. Surgeons should be aware of patient preferences in disclosure, and gaps between perceptions of surgeons, and preferences and needs of patients.",0
24100055,Incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II and postoperative recovery of platelet count in liver graft recipients: a retrospective cohort analysis,"BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia in patients with end-stage liver disease is a common disorder caused mainly by portal hypertension, low levels of thrombopoetin, and endotoxemia. The impact of immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT type II) as a cause of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation is not yet understood, with few literature citations reporting contradictory results. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the perioperative course of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation and determine the occurrence of clinical HIT type II. METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 205 consecutive adult patients who underwent full-size liver transplantation between January 2006 and December 2010 due to end-stage or malignant liver disease. Preoperative platelet count, postoperative course of platelets, and clinical signs of HIT type II were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 155 (75.6%) of 205 patients had thrombocytopenia before transplantation, significantly influenced by Model of End-Stage Liver Disease score and liver cirrhosis. The platelet count exceeded 100,000/muL in most of the patients (n = 193) at a medium of 7 d. Regarding HIT II, there were four (1.95%) patients with a background of HIT type II. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HIT in patients with end-stage hepatic failure is, with about 1.95%, rare. For further reduction of HIT type II, the use of intravenous heparin should be avoided and the prophylactic anticoagulation should be performed with low-molecular-weight heparin after normalization of platelet count.",0
16788707,Oral magnesium supplementation in asthmatic children: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term effect of oral magnesium supplementation on clinical symptoms, bronchial reactivity, lung function and allergen-induced skin responses in children and adolescents with moderate persistent asthma. DESIGN: A double-blind randomized parallel placebo-controlled study. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: The patients were recruited from the Pediatric Outpatient Clinic, Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Immunology, and followed at the Center for Investigation in Pediatrics at State University of Campinas Hospital, Brazil. Thirty-seven out of 72 patients met the study criteria. There were no dropouts. INTERVENTION: The 37 patients (aged 7-19 years, 19 males) were randomized in two groups: magnesium (n=18, 300 mg/day) and placebo (n=19), during 2 months. Both patient groups received inhaled fluticasone (250 microg twice a day) and salbutamol as needed. The primary outcome was bronchial reactivity evaluated with methacholine challenge test (PC20). RESULTS: After a follow-up of 2 months, the methacholine PC20 for testing bronchial reactivity has augmented significantly in the magnesium group only. The skin responses to recognized antigens have also decreased in patients treated with magnesium. The forced vital capacity (FVC), the forced expiratory volume at first second (FEV1), the forced expiratory flow at 25-75 and the FEV1/FVC ratio were similar in both groups. The magnesium group presented fewer asthma exacerbations and used less salbutamol compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Oral magnesium supplementation helped to reduce bronchial reactivity to methacholine, to diminish their allergen-induced skin responses and to provide better symptom control in pediatric patients with moderate persistent asthma treated with inhaled fluticasone.",0
11278816,"Features of the parkin/ariadne-like ubiquitin ligase, HHARI, that regulate its interaction with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Ubch7","We recently reported the identification of a RING finger-containing protein, HHARI (human homologue of Drosophila ariadne), which binds to the human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7 in vitro. We now demonstrate that HHARI interacts and co-localizes with UbcH7 in mammalian cells, particularly in the perinuclear region. We have further defined a minimal interaction region of HHARI comprising residues 186-254, identified individual amino acid residues essential for the interaction, and determined that the distance between the RING1 finger and IBR (in between RING fingers) domains is critical to maintaining binding. We have also established that the RING1 finger of HHARI cannot be substituted for by the highly homologous RING finger domains of either of the ubiquitin-protein ligase components c-CBL or Parkin, despite their similarity in structure and their independent capabilities to bind UbcH7. Furthermore, mutation of the RING1 finger domain of HHARI from a RING-HC to a RING-H2 type abolishes interaction with UbcH7. These studies demonstrate that very subtle changes to the domains that regulate recognition between highly conserved components of the ubiquitin pathway can dramatically affect their ability to interact.",1

15092011,Arrested municipal solid waste incinerator fly ash as a source of heavy metals to the UK environment,"Arrested fly ash samples from most currently operating municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerators in the UK have been analysed for a range of elements. Some of the more important heavy metals ranged in concentration as follows: Cd, 21-4646 (median = 271) mg kg(-1); Cu, 296-1307 (642) mg kg(-1); Cr, 44-1328 (574) mg kg(-1); Ni, 45-2204 (74) mg kg(-1); Pb, 447-9704 (4337) mg kg(-1); and Zn, 2285-13,500 (9232) mg kg(-1). These concentrations represent considerable enrichments relative to median UK soil concentrations. Enrichment ratios (defined as median fly ash: median UK soil) were as follows: Mn 1.6; Co 2.6; Ni 3.3; Ba 11; Sr 11; Cr 15; Cu 35; Pb 108; Zn 113; Cd 387. It is estimated that MSW incinerator ash contributes c. 15 t Cd and 241 t Pb to UK landfill sites per annum. These figures compare with previous studies by Hutton & Symon (Hutton, M. & Symon, C. (1986). The quantities of cadmium, lead, mercury and arsenic entering the UK environment from human activities. Sci. Total Environ., 57, 129-50.) which estimated that annual inputs to UK landfills from coal fly ash are c. 60 t Cd and 1270 t Pb. However, it is argued that metals associated with MSW ashes are potentially of greater environmental significance than in coal ashes, because they are much more available and present at much higher concentrations.",0

17451052,Using brain slice cultures of mouse brain to assess the effect of growth factors on differentiation of bone marrow derived stem cells,"Bone marrow derived stem cells (BMDSCs) have been reported to form neurons and supportive cells in the brain. We describe a technique that combines the simplicity of in vitro studies with many of the advantages of in vivo experiments. We cultured mouse brain slices, deposited GFP-tagged BMDSCs evenly distributed on their surfaces, and then added test factors to the culture medium. Addition of both SDF-1 and EGF resulted in morphological changes of BMDSC and in the induction of islet-1, a marker of neuroepithelial progenitors. We conclude that organotypic tissue culture (OTC) may allow us to detect the effects of exogenous factors on the differentiation of BMDSCs (or any other type of stem cells) in an environment that may resemble the CNS after brain injury. Once such factors have been identified they could be evaluated for tissue regeneration in more complex, whole animal models.",0

33243562,The effect of the amylose content and milling fractions on the physico-chemical features of co-extruded snacks from corn,"The suitability of corn fractions (break meal: 250-500 microm; flour: < 150 microm) from hybrids with different amylose contents (conventional: 18%; high-amylose: 42%; waxy: 2%) and their blends, to produce co-extruded snacks was assessed. Corn flour exhibited a higher content in total soluble phenolic acids (+34%) than break meal. The high-amylose hybrid maintained a higher antioxidant capacity and phenolic acid content (+52% for soluble and + 54% for cell-wall bound phenolic acids), even after extrusion, than the conventional one. Because of its gelatinization properties (high pasting and peak temperatures; low maximum viscosity), the high-amylose hybrid produced co-extruded snacks characterized by low section areas and large inner areas. The blends led to snacks whose features (sections and inner areas, porosity and hardness) did not follow a linear trend with the amylose content, suggesting the need for further studies to better understand the starch interactions that take place among the various hybrids.",0
16216448,"Characterization of a complex genomic alteration on chromosome 2p that leads to four alternatively spliced fusion transcripts in the neuroblastoma cell lines IMR-5, IMR-5/75 and IMR-32","Genetic aberrations in neuroblastoma (NB) have been extensively characterized over the last years. Alterations of the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p) have been of particular interest, since amplification of the MYCN oncogene on 2p24 is associated with an adverse outcome in NB patients. Here, we report on the characterization of a novel genomic rearrangement involving genetic material from 2p13 and 2p24 in NB cell lines that was discovered based on a serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) profile of the MYCN-amplified NB cell line IMR-5. By analysis of a highly expressed SAGE tag not matching a Unigene cluster we identified four alternatively spliced corresponding transcripts, each of which consisted of the first 14 exons of the anthrax toxin receptor 1 gene (2p13.1) and varying combinations of exons of an unidentified gene located 1.3 Mb telomeric of MYCN (2p24.3) that was termed novel neuroblastoma gene 1. By Southern Blotting, Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization and Long Distance Inverse-PCR we disclosed that these transcripts result from a genomic alteration including material from distinct regions of chromosome 2p and four genomic breakpoints that are joined by short sequences of unknown origin. Furthermore, we show that this rearrangement lies within the homogeneous staining regions (HSR) in IMR-32 cells and is prevalent in both IMR-32 cells and their sub-clones IMR-5 and IMR-5/75, but not in a panel of 70 primary NB tumors. Our work is the first study discovering a fusion transcript based on a SAGE profile and for the first time precisely describes the DNA sequence of amplified breakpoint regions in NB.",1
20567873,Voriconazole-associated salt-losing nephropathy,"A 74-year-old man was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and steroid therapy was initiated. Subsequently, he was affected by deep mycosis, and hence, voriconazole (VRCZ) was administered. On the 16th day, he was transferred to our hospital because of somnolence and malaise. His systolic blood pressure was approximately 80 mmHg, and he showed decreased skin turgor, indicating volume depletion. Laboratory analysis revealed hyponatremia and liver dysfunction. Discontinuation of VRCZ and drip infusion of normal saline improved the consciousness disorder, hyponatremia, and liver dysfunction. The levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and plasma renin activity were elevated. This patient showed high excreted urine sodium, despite volume depletion and low serum osmolality. Therefore, this patient was diagnosed with salt-losing nephropathy (SLN). SLN should be considered for treatment of VRCZ-associated hyponatremia, together with syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH.",0

2969496,Chromosomal localization of the human genes for lipocortin I and lipocortin II,"The human genes which code for Lipocortin I and Lipocortin II, proteins that inhibit phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity, have been regionally localized in the human genome by chromosomal in situ hybridization and segregation analysis in somatic cell hybrids using cDNA clones for Lipocortin I and II. Lipocortin I, the 35 kd substrate for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor/kinase, maps to chromosome region 9q11- greater than q22. The Lipocortin II cDNA probe detects at least four independently segregating loci which map to human chromosome regions 4q21-q31.1, 9pter-q34 proximal to c-abl, 10q proximal to 10q24 and 15q21-q22 proximal to the 15q22 translocation breakpoint characteristic of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Thus, Lipocortin I and one locus detected by Lipocortin II cDNA are syntenic on chromosome 9; one Lipocortin II locus is perhaps not far from the genes for EGF and IL-2 on 4q; and another of the Lipocortin II loci is on 15q, perhaps not far from the APL breakpoint.",1
7806238,"A new human gene (DXS1357E) with ubiquitous expression, located in Xq28 adjacent to the adrenoleukodystrophy gene",We have isolated a new human gene (DXS1357E; laboratory name: CDM) localized in Xq28. This gene is transcribed from the same CpG island as the adrenoleukodystrophy gene (ALD) and oriented in the opposite direction. It encodes a 1.5-kb transcript that exhibits ubiquitous expression and contains a single open reading frame. The 246 deduced amino acid sequence suggests the presence of membrane-associated segments and a weak similarity with the rod-like tail portion of heavy chain myosins from different species. The DXS1357E gene may be a candidate for one of the many diseases mapping to this region. A preliminary analysis did not show rearrangements of the gene in 19 independent patients with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.,1
24455618,Efficacy and safety of human papillomavirus vaccine for primary prevention of cervical cancer: A review of evidence from phase III trials and national programs,"The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been widely introduced in the national immunization programs in most of the medium and high income countries following endorsement from national and international advisory bodies. HPV vaccine is unique and its introduction is challenging in many ways - it is the first vaccine developed to prevent any cancer, the vaccine is gender specific, it targets adolescent females who are difficult to reach by any health intervention programs. It is not unusual for such a vaccine to face scepticism and reservations not only from lay public but also from professionals in spite of the clinical trial results convincingly and consistently proving their efficacy and safety. Over the last few years millions of doses of the HPV vaccine have been administered round the world and the efficacy and safety data have started coming from the real life programs. A comprehensive cervical cancer control program involving HPV vaccination of the adolescent girls and screening of the adult women has been proved to be the most cost-effective approach to reduce the burden of cervical cancer. The present article discusses the justification of HPV vaccination in the backdrop of natural history of cervical cancer, the mechanism of action of the vaccines, efficacy and safety data from phase III randomized controlled trials as well as from the national immunization programs of various countries.

16005208,Vitamin D effective ultraviolet wavelengths due to scattering in shade,"Solar UVB radiation (280-320 nm) is an initiator of Vitamin D3 production in the human skin. While numerous studies have been conducted in relation to the biological impact of UV exposure in full sun, less research has investigated the irradiances in shade. The purpose of this study was to determine the levels of UV radiation in relation to Vitamin D3 induction with six commonly encountered shade environments for the larger solar zenith angles observed during autumn and winter. Spectral UV irradiance measurements were made under relatively clear sky conditions at a sub-tropical Southern Hemisphere site for six specific shade environments and solar zenith angle between 35 degrees and 60 degrees to investigate the biologically effective UV irradiances for pre-Vitamin D3 production. Data from this research indicates that pre-Vitamin D3 effective UV wavelengths in the shade were most significant for tree shade and a shade umbrella. Compared to that in full sun, pre-Vitamin D3 effective UV wavelengths were at levels of approximately 52 and 55%, respectively, beneath the shade umbrella and in tree shade. UVB irradiance levels in the shade of a northern facing covered veranda and in a car with windows closed were significantly less than those beneath the shade umbrella, with levels of approximately 11 and 0%, respectively, of those in full sun. Shade is important as a UV minimisation strategy; however, it may also play an important role in providing the human body with adequate levels of UVB radiation for pre-Vitamin D3 production without experiencing the relatively higher levels of UVA irradiances present in full sun.",0
23263589,Assessment of risk of bleeding from esophageal varices during management of biliary atresia in children,"OBJECTIVES: The management of esophageal varices (EV) in children experiencing biliary atresia (BA) remains controversial. Recent studies in children proposed initiating a prophylactic treatment in patients with severe (grade III) EV and/or EV associated with red color signs. Our study was aimed at assessing the risk of bleeding from EV in a series of patients with BA, identifying risk factors for bleeding to develop a predictive model of bleeding. METHODS: This was a retrospective study including 83 eligible patients with BA. Clinical, ultrasonographic, endoscopic, and laboratory parameters were studied from the beginning of medical management up to the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients not presenting any bleeding, data were analyzed until liver transplantation, endoscopic treatment of EV was performed, or last follow-up. Risk factors were investigated using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. RESULTS: Seventeen of 83 patients (20%) presented gastrointestinal bleeding, with a median age of 9.5 months (6-50 months). In univariate and multivariate analyses, high-grade EV, red color signs on endoscopic examination, and low fibrinogen levels, at first endoscopy, were identified as risk factors for bleeding. When tested in >10,000 different models, these 3 variables appeared to play the most significant role in predicting bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed that grade III EV and red color signs are risk factors for bleeding in patients followed up for BA. We identified low fibrinogen levels as an additional risk factor. The relevance of these 3 factors to predict bleeding from EV requires validation in a prospective study.",0
17412672,Intense ultrasonic clicks from echolocating toothed whales do not elicit anti-predator responses or debilitate the squid Loligo pealeii,"Toothed whales use intense ultrasonic clicks to echolocate prey and it has been hypothesized that they also acoustically debilitate their prey with these intense sound pulses to facilitate capture. Cephalopods are an important food source for toothed whales, and there has probably been an evolutionary selection pressure on cephalopods to develop a mechanism for detecting and evading sound-emitting toothed whale predators. Ultrasonic detection has evolved in some insects to avoid echolocating bats, and it can be hypothesized that cephalopods might have evolved similar ultrasound detection as an anti-predation measure. We test this hypothesis in the squid Loligo pealeii in a playback experiment using intense echolocation clicks from two squid-eating toothed whale species. Twelve squid were exposed to clicks at two repetition rates (16 and 125 clicks per second) with received sound pressure levels of 199-226 dB re1 microPa (pp) mimicking the sound exposure from an echolocating toothed whale as it approaches and captures prey. We demonstrate that intense ultrasonic clicks do not elicit any detectable anti-predator behaviour in L. pealeii and that clicks with received levels up to 226 dB re1 microPa (pp) do not acoustically debilitate this cephalopod species.",0

23252563,Prognostic factors after resection of colorectal liver metastases: from morphology to biology,"Despite improved overall survival rates after potentially curative liver resection (~50-58% at 5 years), almost half of patients experience disease recurrence highlighting the need for a precise definition of outcomes to stratify patients for clinical trials and to guide treatment decisions. In the past, several factors, such as an advanced primary T stage, the primary N+ status, a large tumor size, multiple tumors, a disease-free interval of <12 months, an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level, the presence of an extrahepatic disease, and the margin width (<1 cm) and status (positive), have been recognized to predict poor outcomes, but most of them lack the sensitivity for accurate individual prognostication. Thus, in recent years, new factors, such as response to chemotherapy, either clinical or pathological, that more closely reflect tumor biology have been established and adopted in the clinical practice. Similarly, biomarkers of poor prognosis, especially mutations in KRAS and BRAF and the expression of thymidylate synthase, have been studied, yielding promising results. However, robust evidence of their prognostic utility awaits prospective validation.",0

15361900,Comparison of spatial interpolation methods for the estimation of air quality data,"We recognized that many health outcomes are associated with air pollution, but in this project launched by the US EPA, the intent was to assess the role of exposure to ambient air pollutants as risk factors only for respiratory effects in children. The NHANES-III database is a valuable resource for assessing children's respiratory health and certain risk factors, but lacks monitoring data to estimate subjects' exposures to ambient air pollutants. Since the 1970s, EPA has regularly monitored levels of several ambient air pollutants across the country and these data may be used to estimate NHANES subject's exposure to ambient air pollutants. The first stage of the project eventually evolved into assessing different estimation methods before adopting the estimates to evaluate respiratory health. Specifically, this paper describes an effort using EPA's AIRS monitoring data to estimate ozone and PM10 levels at census block groups. We limited those block groups to counties visited by NHANES-III to make the project more manageable and apply four different interpolation methods to the monitoring data to derive air concentration levels. Then we examine method-specific differences in concentration levels and determine conditions under which different methods produce significantly different concentration values. We find that different interpolation methods do not produce dramatically different estimations in most parts of the US where monitor density was relatively low. However, in areas where monitor density was relatively high (i.e., California), we find substantial differences in exposure estimates across the interpolation methods. Our results offer some insights into terms of using the EPA monitoring data for the chosen spatial interpolation methods.",0

19665583,Variation in detection of adenomas and polyps by colonoscopy and change over time with a performance improvement program,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: There has been no prospective, community-based study to track changes in adenoma detection by individual physicians over time and to determine the effectiveness of targeted educational interventions. METHODS: We prospectively collected information on 47,253 screening colonoscopies in average-risk individuals 50 years and older performed by a community-based practice in the Twin Cities of Minnesota. During a period of 3 years, 5 specific interventions were implemented; each was designed to improve adenoma detection rates. Controlling for patient-related and procedure-related factors, rates of adenoma detection and 3-year trends for individual physicians were plotted, and intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify factors associated with detection of adenomas and polyps. RESULTS: At least 1 polyp and 1 adenoma were found in 36% and 22% of examinations, respectively. Adenoma detection rates by endoscopists ranged from 10%-39%. There was no significant improvement during the study period despite planned, systematic interventions. Factors associated with adenoma detection included age of the patient (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.02), male sex (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.34-1.74), and adequate preparation quality (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.64-3.12). CONCLUSIONS: The detection of adenomas by individual physicians during a 3-year period varied and did not appear to change between individual endoscopists, despite planned, systematic interventions. This indicates that other targeted interventions might be required to improve adenoma detection rates among experienced, community gastroenterologists.",0

3036094,The mechanism of potentiation of horseradish peroxidase-catalysed oxidation of NADPH by porphyrins,"Several porphyrins, including HpD (haematoporphyrin derivative), potentiate the oxidation of NADPH by horseradish peroxidase/H2O2. To elucidate the mechanism of potentiation, the following observations are relevant. During peroxidase-catalysed NADPH oxidation, O2-.(superoxide radical) is generated, as judged from superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction. This generation of O2-. is suppressed by HpD. Peroxidase-catalysed NADPH oxidation is stimulated by superoxide dismutase and by anaerobic conditions. Under anaerobic conditions HpD has no influence on peroxide-catalysed NADPH oxidation. Previous studies have shown that horseradish peroxidase is inhibited by O2-.. Thus the experimental results indicate that the potentiating effect of HpD can be explained by its ability to inhibit O2-. generation in the horseradish peroxidase/H2O2/NADPH system.",0

2011603,Aspartylglycosaminuria in the Finnish population: identification of two point mutations in the heavy chain of glycoasparaginase,"Aspartylglycosaminuria is an inherited lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of glycoasparaginase (EC 3.5.1.26) and occurs with higher frequency among Finns than other populations. We have purified human glycoasparaginase and determined about 90% of the amino acid sequence of its light subunit and greater than 70% of that of its heavy subunit by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Additional sequence data were obtained from the cloning and subsequent nucleotide analysis of a cDNA corresponding to the normal human glycoasparaginase gene. The enzyme is encoded by a single mRNA as a single polypeptide that is posttranslationally processed to generate the subunits and is glycosylated. After preparing first-strand cDNA from leukocyte and fibroblast total RNA, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the glycoasparaginase cDNA of eight Finnish aspartylglycosaminuria patients. We demonstrate that the Finnish patients' mRNA sequence differed from the normal sequence by two single-base changes six nucleotides apart from one another in the heavy chain of glycoasparaginase. The first change resulted in the replacement of arginine by glutamine (R161Q), whereas the second change resulted in a cysteine to serine substitution (C163S). Both mutations resulted in novel restriction endonuclease sites and were present in all eight Finnish aspartylglycosaminuria patients originating from different pedigrees, but they were absent from Finnish and non-Finnish controls and a non-Finnish case of aspartylglycosaminuria. These results indicate molecular homogeneity in aspartylglycosaminuria alleles in the Finnish population.",1

The diffusion coefficient measured at q = 0.03 A(-1) was determined to be 1x10(-17) cm2/s at 342 K (Tg). The self-part of the intermediate scattering function I(s)(q,t) decays exponentially. Samples deposited well below Tg show a substantial thermal history effect during subsequent translational motion at Tg.",0

11495041,The antiestrogen toremifene protects against alcoholic liver injury in female rats,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Females are generally considered to be more susceptible to alcohol-induced liver injury than males. To elucidate whether gonadal hormones are involved, female rats were chronically treated with ethanol and with an antiestrogen. METHODS: Ethanol was administered in a low-carbohydrate liquid diet. Estrogen action was blocked by daily intubation of toremifene, a non-hepatotoxic second generation estrogen receptor antagonist. RESULTS: The female rats consuming intoxicating amounts of ethanol diet for 6 weeks developed massive microvesicular/macrovesicular steatosis, frequent inflammatory foci and spotty necrosis. Serum alanine aminotransferase increased 7-fold. Toremifene treatment did not affect steatosis, but significantly reduced inflammation and necrosis. Ethanol increased the expression of CD14 and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) alpha mRNA and also the production of TNF-alpha by isolated Kupffer cells, but toremifene had no significant counteracting effect. However, toremifene significantly alleviated both ethanol induction of the pro-oxidant enzyme CYP2E1 and ethanol reduction of the oxidant-protective enzyme Se-glutathione peroxidase. CONCLUSIONS: The partial protection by toremifene against ethanol-induced liver lesions suggests a pathogenic contribution of estrogens, possibly associated with an oxygen radical mediated mechanism.",0
26615216,Genome-Wide Analysis of Evolutionary Markers of Human Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) Viruses May Guide Selection of Vaccine Strain Candidates,"Here we analyzed whole-genome sequences of 3,969 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 4,774 A(H3N2) strains that circulated during 2009-2015 in the world. The analysis revealed changes at 481 and 533 amino acid sites in proteins of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) strains, respectively. Many of these changes were introduced as a result of random drift. However, there were 61 and 68 changes that were present in relatively large number of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) strains, respectively, that circulated during relatively long time. We named these amino acid substitutions evolutionary markers, as they seemed to contain valuable information regarding the viral evolution. Interestingly, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses acquired non-overlapping sets of evolutionary markers. We next analyzed these characteristic markers in vaccine strains recommended by the World Health Organization for the past five years. Our analysis revealed that vaccine strains carried only few evolutionary markers at antigenic sites of viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The absence of these markers at antigenic sites could affect the recognition of HA and NA by human antibodies generated in response to vaccinations. This could, in part, explain moderate efficacy of influenza vaccines during 2009-2014. Finally, we identified influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) strains, which contain all the evolutionary markers of influenza A strains circulated in 2015, and which could be used as vaccine candidates for the 2015/2016 season. Thus, genome-wide analysis of evolutionary markers of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses may guide selection of vaccine strain candidates. ",0
11948749,Surgery of the motor thalamus: problems with the present nomenclatures,"The literature on thalamic surgery is difficult to read because different nomenclatures are in use. Neurosurgeons mostly use the stereotactic atlas of Schaltenbrand with Hassler's nomenclature of the thalamus. Neuroanatomists use different nomenclatures for the primate thalamus. The cytoarchitectonic definition of nuclei is difficult in the motor thalamus, and it would be best to define the nuclei based on their subcortical afferents. However, tracing studies are not available in humans. Thus, human thalamic nomenclature is based entirely on cytoarchitectonic subdivisions and transfer of knowledge by analogy from monkey to man. Problems arise when trying to transfer the detailed knowledge from monkey to the human brain. By doing so, different authors have come to different conclusions concerning the subcortical afferents of Hassler's motor nuclei, which inevitably leads to confusion when attempting neurophysiological interpretations of the surgical data. The present review draws attention to the discrepancies and open questions in the literature. There is a need to better define the limits of the sensory and cerebellar afferent receiving thalamic nuclei as well as those of the cerebellar and pallidal afferent receiving territories in humans.",0
12673795,Mutational analysis of the ATRX gene by DGGE: a powerful diagnostic approach for the ATRX syndrome,"Molecular defects affecting the ATRX gene lead to the ATRX syndrome (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome, X-linked), characterized by severe mental retardation, microcephaly, distinct facial dysmorphism, and genital abnormalities, as well as a wide spectrum of other pathological features. Alpha thalassemia is frequent but does not represent a constant characteristic of the syndrome. An expanding phenotype of the ATRX gene (a RAD54 homologue encoding a putative zinc-finger helicase) has been demonstrated as a result of the association of single mutations with specific X-linked mental retardation syndromes. To date, mutational analysis of the gene has been based on direct DNA sequencing or using methods with a lower detection rate. In this paper, we present a broad-range DGGE method for single-step mutation scanning of the entire open reading frame (ORF) and canonical splice sites of the gene. Using this method, we successfully identified five novel sequence changes in the ATRX gene, including four missense mutations (K1733E, R2085C, D2136N, T2169A) and one polymorphism (IVS5+35G>A).",1

9843217,ATM associates with and phosphorylates p53: mapping the region of interaction,"The human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is characterized by immunodeficiency, progressive cerebellar ataxia, radiosensitivity, cell cycle checkpoint defects and cancer predisposition. The gene mutated in this syndrome, ATM (for AT mutated), encodes a protein containing a phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase)-like domain. ATM also contains a proline-rich region and a leucine zipper, both of which implicate this protein in signal transduction. The proline-rich region has been shown to bind to the SH3 domain of c-Abl, which facilitates its phosphorylation and activation by ATM. Previous results have demonstrated that AT cells are defective in the G1/S checkpoint activated after radiation damage and that this defect is attributable to a defective p53 signal transduction pathway. We report here direct interaction between ATM and p53 involving two regions in ATM, one at the amino terminus and the other at the carboxy terminus, corresponding to the PI-3 kinase domain. Recombinant ATM protein phosphorylates p53 on serine 15 near the N terminus. Furthermore, ectopic expression of ATM in AT cells restores normal ionizing radiation (IR)-induced phosphorylation of p53, whereas expression of ATM antisense RNA in control cells abrogates the rapid IR-induced phosphorylation of p53 on serine 15. These results demonstrate that ATM can bind p53 directly and is responsible for its serine 15 phosphorylation, thereby contributing to the activation and stabilization of p53 during the IR-induced DNA damage response.",1
2477373,"Characterization of the human Na,K-ATPase alpha 2 gene and identification of intragenic restriction fragment length polymorphisms","We have determined the structure of the gene that encodes the alpha 2 isoform of the human Na,K-ATPase. The gene contains 23 exons and spans approximately 25 kilobases. The amino acid sequence of the human alpha 2 isoform deduced from the genomic sequence exhibits 99% identity to the rat alpha 2 isoform. One of the nine amino acid differences between the human and rat sequences occurs at an amino acid position which is known to be involved in species differences in sensitivity of the alpha 1 isoform to cardiac glycosides. Approximately 1500 base pairs of sequence flanking the 5' end of the alpha 2 gene have been determined. This region contains numerous potential AP-1, AP-2, and NF-1-binding sites, a potential Sp1 recognition site, and several sequences that are similar to the glucocorticoid receptor-binding site. The transcription start site was mapped by primer extension and S1 nuclease protection analyses of RNA from human brain, skeletal muscle, and heart. Multiple transcription initiation sites are clustered between residues -104 to -99 relative to the translation initiation codon. A potential TATA box is located 29 base pairs upstream of the first transcription initiation site. Immediately 5' to the apparent TATA box is a 35-base pair polypurine.polypyrimidine tract containing an imperfect mirror repeat which resembles sequences that form triple-stranded structures. Two intragenic DNA probes which detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms associated with the alpha 2 gene have been identified. These probes will be useful in genetic linkage analyses designed to define the possible role of the Na,K-ATPase in certain hereditary disorders.",1
15849711,"Energetics of nose and mouth breathing, body size, body composition, and nose volume in young adult males and females","This research tests the relative ability of body size factors and sex to explain variation in nose volume and to explain metabolic measures during rest and moderate exercise in 50 young adults. It uses standard anthropometric measures plus two new measures of nose morphology (nose/face angle and nose volume) and evaluates body composition with a device for air displacement plethysmography. Standard physiological measures were obtained in nose-only and mouth-only breathing conditions with subjects at rest and using moderate exercise. A factor representing linear and bulk measures of body size and a factor representing lean body mass explain subjects' variation in nose volume, resting volume of oxygen consumed (VO2), and resting ventilation volume (VV) better than subject's sex does. By contrast, during exercise, sex explains VO2 and VV better than do body size factors, probably because hormone-mediated muscularity in males produced greater work output. Nose breathing was found to be more energetically efficient in most but not all subjects, but additional research is needed to explore this finding further. Qualitative comparisons between modes of breathing and the application of this research protocol to studies of climate-related patterns of nasal variation are discussed.",0
31439799,Phospho-dependent phase separation of FMRP and CAPRIN1 recapitulates regulation of translation and deadenylation,"Membraneless organelles involved in RNA processing are biomolecular condensates assembled by phase separation. Despite the important role of intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs), the specific interactions underlying IDR phase separation and its functional consequences remain elusive. To address these questions, we used minimal condensates formed from the C-terminal disordered regions of two interacting translational regulators, FMRP and CAPRIN1. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of FMRP-CAPRIN1 condensates revealed interactions involving arginine-rich and aromatic-rich regions. We found that different FMRP serine/threonine and CAPRIN1 tyrosine phosphorylation patterns control phase separation propensity with RNA, including subcompartmentalization, and tune deadenylation and translation rates in vitro. The resulting evidence for residue-specific interactions underlying co-phase separation, phosphorylation-modulated condensate architecture, and enzymatic activity within condensates has implications for how the integration of signaling pathways controls RNA processing and translation.",1
9405233,Molecular cloning and expression of a novel human aquaporin from adipose tissue with glycerol permeability,"In a systematic analysis of genes expressed in human adipose tissue, we detected a novel gene that is expressed uniquely in adipose tissue. The sequence showed that it encodes a 342-amino-acid protein containing six putative transmembrane domains, and is a new member of the aquaporin family of water-selective membrane channels. We named this gene aquaporin 9. It features a cyclic-AMP protein kinase phosphorylation consensus site in the NH3-terminal domain. Expression of the cRNA in Xenopus oocytes yielded a 7-fold increase in osmotic water permeability blocked by 0.3 mM HgCl2, and also facilitated the uptake of glycerol. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the mRNA is abundant in adipose tissue, but not in other tissues. Thus, this gene product may participate in glycerol transport in adipocytes.",1
24906127,Virus infection cycle events coupled to RNA replication,"Replication, the process by which the genetic material of a virus is copied to generate multiple progeny genomes, is the central part of the virus infection cycle. For an infection to be productive, it is essential that this process is coordinated with other aspects of the cycle, such as translation of the viral genome, encapsidation, and movement of the genome between cells. In the case of positive-strand RNA viruses, this represents a particular challenge, as the infecting genome must not only be replicated but also serve as an mRNA for the production of the replication-associated proteins. In recent years, it has become apparent that in positive-strand RNA plant viruses all the aspects of the infection cycle are intertwined. This article reviews the current state of knowledge regarding replication-associated events in such viruses. ",0

26911677,Loss of carbonic anhydrase XII function in individuals with elevated sweat chloride concentration and pulmonary airway disease,"Elevated sweat chloride levels, failure to thrive (FTT), and lung disease are characteristic features of cystic fibrosis (CF, OMIM #219700). Here we describe variants in CA12 encoding carbonic anhydrase XII in two pedigrees exhibiting CF-like phenotypes. Exome sequencing of a white American adult diagnosed with CF due to elevated sweat chloride, recurrent hyponatremia, infantile FTT and lung disease identified deleterious variants in each CA12 gene: c.908-1 G>A in a splice acceptor and a novel frameshift insertion c.859_860insACCT. In an unrelated consanguineous Omani family, two children with elevated sweat chloride, infantile FTT, and recurrent hyponatremia were homozygous for a novel missense variant (p.His121Gln). Deleterious CFTR variants were absent in both pedigrees. CA XII protein was localized apically in human bronchiolar epithelia and basolaterally in the reabsorptive duct of human sweat glands. Respiratory epithelial cell RNA from the adult proband revealed only aberrant CA12 transcripts and in vitro analysis showed greatly reduced CA XII protein. Studies of ion transport across respiratory epithelial cells in vivo and in culture revealed intact CFTR-mediated chloride transport in the adult proband. CA XII protein bearing either p.His121Gln or a previously identified p.Glu143Lys missense variant localized to the basolateral membranes of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, but enzyme activity was severely diminished when assayed at physiologic concentrations of extracellular chloride. Our findings indicate that loss of CA XII function should be considered in individuals without CFTR mutations who exhibit CF-like features in the sweat gland and lung.",1
8610162,"Imprinting of the gene encoding a human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p57KIP2, on chromosome 11p15","Parental origin-specific alterations of chromosome 11p15 in human cancer suggest the involvement of one or more maternally expressed imprinted genes involved in embryonal tumor suppression and the cancer-predisposing Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). The gene encoding cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57KIP2, whose overexpression causes G1 phase arrest, was recently cloned and mapped to this band. We find that the p57KIP2 gene is imprinted, with preferential expression of the maternal allele. However, the imprint is not absolute, as the paternal allele is also expressed at low levels in most tissues, and at levels comparable to the maternal allele in fetal brain and some embryonal tumors. The biochemical function, chromosomal location, and imprinting of the p57KIP2 gene match the properties predicted for a tumor suppressor gene at 11p15.5. However, as the p57KIP2 gene is 500 kb centromeric to the gene encoding insulin-like growth factor 2, it is likely to be part of a large domain containing other imprinted genes. Thus, loss of heterozygosity or loss of imprinting might simultaneously affect several genes at this locus that together contribute to tumor and/or growth- suppressing functions that are disrupted in BWS and embryonal tumors.",1
7535801,Molecular basis of subtotal complement C6 deficiency. A carboxy-terminally truncated but functionally active C6,"Individuals with subtotal complement C6 deficiency possess a C6 molecule that is 14% shorter than normal C6 and present in low but detectable concentrations (1-2% of the normal mean). We now show that this dysmorphic C6 is bactericidally active and lacks an epitope that was mapped to the most carboxy-terminal part of C6 using C6 cDNA fragments expressed as fusion proteins in the pUEX expression system. We thus predicted that the abnormal C6 molecule might be carboxy-terminally truncated and sought a mutation in an area approximately 14% from the carboxy-terminal end of the coding sequence. By sequencing PCR-amplified products from this region, we found, in three individuals from two families, a mutation that might plausibly be responsible for the defect. All three have an abnormal 5' splice donor site of intron 15, which would probably prevent splicing. An in-frame stop codon is found 17 codons downstream from the intron boundary, which would lead to a truncated polypeptide 13.5% smaller than normal C6. This result was unexpected, as earlier studies mapped the C5b binding site, or a putative enzymatic region, to this part of C6. Interestingly, all three subjects were probably heterozygous for both subtotal C6 and complete C6 deficiency.",1
20528147,Risk factors for and epidemiology of surgical site infections,"BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection (SSI) continues to be a major complication following operations. Identification of the frequency, the causative organisms, and the risk factors for infection still requires better definition. METHODS: Review of the current surgical literature was undertaken to define the epidemiology and risk factors associated with SSI. RESULTS: The rates of SSI continue to be reported with great variability, even for the same operation. Variable classification and definitions, inconsistent auditing, and an increase in post-discharge identification of infection are partially responsible for this variation. Understanding the role of the bacterial inocula and the response of the host leads to better utilization of preventive antibiotics and enhancement of host responsiveness (e.g., tissue warming). Better applications and studies of topical antiseptics need to be undertaken because of their long history of proved value. CONCLUSIONS: With a better understanding of the risk factors and epidemiology, effective preventive strategies can be utilized to reduce the current rates of SSI.",0
22449147,Prevalent founder mutation c.736T>A of LIPH in autosomal recessive woolly hair of Japanese leads to variable severity of hypotrichosis in adulthood,"BACKGROUND: Mutations in LIPH are a cause of autosomal recessive woolly hair (ARWH). Homozygous c.736T>A (p.Cys246Ser), and compound heterozygous c.736T>A and c.742C>A (p.His248Asn) have been reported in 5 and 7 Japanese children with ARWH respectively. The severity of hypotrichosis is known to be able to change in the clinical course, and the mutation patterns of LIPH do not always correlate with the severity of hypotrichosis in ARWH caused by other mutation sites of LIPH. However, all 12 Japanese children previously reported to have ARWH have shown similar severity of hypotrichosis. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the clinical features and molecular basis of ARWH in patients including three adults (three adults and two children) from five non-related Japanese families. METHODS: Five families of Japanese origin that presented with woolly hair were studied. The phenotype was confirmed by clinical examination. Direct automated DNA sequencing of the LIPH gene was performed to identify the mutations in our probands. RESULTS: All patients had had woolly hair since birth. Homozygous c.736T>A mutations were found in four patients, including three adult cases, and compound heterozygous c.736T>A and c.742C>A mutations were found in one child patient. The two adults and two children had only sparse scalp hair, although one adult woman had mild hypotrichosis with long hairs. CONCLUSION: Some patients with homozygous c.736T>A can have a mild hypotrichosis phenotype with long hairs in adulthood.",0
32067936,Longer Participation in WIC Is Associated with Better Diet Quality in 24-Month-Old Children,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about duration of exposure to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in relation to children's diet quality. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the association between duration of WIC participation and diet quality of 24-month-old children. DESIGN: A national longitudinal observational study was conducted with participants initially enrolled in WIC in 2013. Telephone interviews were conducted with study mothers from 2013 to 2016. Duration of WIC participation was categorized as high, medium, or low based on the number of interviews during which participants reported receiving WIC benefits. PARTICIPANTS: Participants in the WIC Infant and Toddler Feeding Practices Study 2 who had completed a baseline interview and all interviews through 24 months were included; participants who reported discontinuing WIC due to perceived program ineligibility were excluded from analyses (N=1,250). Data were weighted to represent the study-eligible population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Healthy Eating Index 2015 scores of children at age 24 months were calculated based on 24-hour dietary recalls. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Unadjusted analysis of variance examined Healthy Eating Index 2015 scores by WIC participation duration. Multivariate linear regression analysis tested independent effects of WIC duration on Healthy Eating Index 2015 total scores, controlling for sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: After controlling for covariates, WIC participation duration was significantly associated with diet quality. Children in the high duration group had significantly higher Healthy Eating Index 2015 total scores (adjusted mean 59.3, 95% CI 58.6 to 60.1) than children in the low duration group (adjusted mean 55.3, 95% CI 51.6 to 59.0) (P=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Children who received WIC benefits during most of the first 2 years of life had better diet quality at age 24 months than children who, despite remaining eligible for benefits, discontinued WIC benefits during infancy. Findings suggest nutritional benefits for eligible children who stay in the program longer.",0
2010234,Intra-thecal treatment of leptomeningeal lymphoma with immunotoxin,"An animal model has been established to investigate the effect of intra-thecal (i.t.) immunotoxins in the treatment of leptomeningeal metastases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Direct inoculation of L2C lymphoma cells into the cisterna magna of guinea-pigs gives rise to a leptomeningeal pattern of growth, similar to that of human ALL, and to a systemic leukaemia which develops in approximately 14 days. In our model the systemic disease could be controlled with cyclophosphamide while the meningeal disease progressed and provided a target for i.t. immunotoxin. The immunotoxin used consisted of an anti-idiotypic antibody disulphide-bonded to the ribosome-inactivating protein saporin. It was highly cytotoxic to L2C cells in vitro, being around 30,000 times more potent than a control immunotoxin at inhibiting protein synthesis. In vivo, the maximum tolerated dose of i.t. immunotoxin was 10 micrograms. From the rate at which radiolabelled immunotoxins appeared in the plasma following i.t. injection, we were able to estimate that its half-life in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was between 1 1/2 and 2 hr. Intrathecal treatment of guinea-pigs with immunotoxin 1 day after inoculation of L2C cells into the cisterna magna had a remarkable therapeutic effect. All guinea-pigs treated with 0.5 or 5 micrograms of immunotoxin survived, and remained tumour-free for more than 100 days after treatment, while control animals given cyclophosphamide alone or an irrelevant immunotoxin had a mean survival time of 28 days. Provided concerns over toxicity can be overcome, these results indicate that i.t. immunotoxins offer an alternative, highly specific form of treatment in leptomeningeal neoplasia.",0
31781126,Calreticulin and Galectin-3 Opsonise Bacteria for Phagocytosis by Microglia,"Opsonins are soluble, extracellular proteins, released by activated immune cells, and when bound to a target cell, can induce phagocytes to phagocytose the target cell. There are three known classes of opsonin: antibodies, complement factors and secreted pattern recognition receptors, but these have limited access to the brain. We identify here two novel opsonins of bacteria, calreticulin, and galectin-3 (both lectins that can bind lipopolysaccharide), which were released by microglia (brain-resident macrophages) when activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Calreticulin and galectin-3 both bound to Escherichia coli, and when bound increased phagocytosis of these bacteria by microglia. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide-induced microglial phagocytosis of E. coli bacteria was partially inhibited by: sugars, an anti-calreticulin antibody, a blocker of the calreticulin phagocytic receptor LRP1, a blocker of the galectin-3 phagocytic receptor MerTK, or simply removing factors released from the microglia, indicating this phagocytosis is dependent on extracellular calreticulin and galectin-3. Thus, calreticulin and galectin-3 are opsonins, released by activated microglia to promote clearance of bacteria. This innate immune response of microglia may help clear bacterial infections of the brain.",0
21640710,MicroRNAs expression in ox-LDL treated HUVECs: MiR-365 modulates apoptosis and Bcl-2 expression,"Endothelial cells (ECs) apoptosis induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) is thought to play a critical role in atherosclerosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs that posttranscriptionally regulate the expression of genes involved in diverse cell functions, including differentiation, growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. However, whether miRNAs are associated with ox-LDL induced apoptosis and their effect on ECs is still unknown. Therefore, this study evaluated potential miRNAs and their involvement in ECs apoptosis in response to ox-LDL stimulation. Microarray and qRT-PCR analysis performed on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to ox-LDL identified 15 differentially expressed (4 up- and 11 down-regulated) miRNAs. Web-based query tools were utilized to predict the target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs, and the potential target genes were classified into different function categories with the gene ontology (GO) term and KEGG pathway annotation. In particular, bioinformatics analysis suggested that anti-apoptotic protein B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) is a target gene of miR-365, an apoptomir up-regulated by ox-LDL stimulation in HUVECs. We further showed that transfection of miR-365 inhibitor partly restored Bcl-2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, leading to a reduction of ox-LDL-mediated apoptosis in HUVECs. Taken together, our findings indicate that miRNAs participate in ox-LDL-mediated apoptosis in HUVECs. MiR-365 potentiates ox-LDL-induced ECs apoptosis by regulating the expression of Bcl-2, suggesting potential novel therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis.",1
10827888,Psychometric properties of the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). New self-rating scale,"BACKGROUND: Of available self-rated social phobia scales, none assesses the spectrum of fear, avoidance, and physiological symptoms, all of which are clinically important. Because of this limitation, we developed the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). AIMS: To establish psychometric validation of the SPIN. METHOD: Subjects from three clinical trials and two control groups were given the 17-item, self-rated SPIN. Validity was assessed against several established measures of social anxiety, global assessments of severity and improvement, and scales assessing physical health and disability. RESULTS: Good test-retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity were obtained. A SPIN score of 19 distinguished between social phobia subjects and controls. The SPIN was responsive to change in symptoms over time and reflected different responses to active drugs v. placebo. Factorial analysis identified five factors. CONCLUSIONS: The SPIN demonstrates solid psychometric properties and shows promise as a measurement for the screening of, and treatment response to, social phobia.",0
20354277,Matrix metalloproteinase- 9 polymorphisms in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. A preliminary experience,"UNLABELLED: Polymorphisms Q279R, P574R and -1562 C/T of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) gene have been linked with the risk of cancer and with tumoral aggressiveness in various types of cancer. So far there are no studies in the literature analysing the link between polymorphisms Q279R, P574R and -1562 C/T of MMP-9 and prostate cancer. OBJECTIVES: To establish the presence of the MMP-9's gene polymorphisms (Q279R, P574R and -1562 C/T)in relation to results of prostate biopsy, PSA values and Gleason score. METHODS: Hospital cohort of 100 patients with suspected prostate cancer, subjected to prostate biopsy, in whom the MMP-9 polymorphisms (Q279R, P574R and -1562 C/T) were analysed using the PCR-RLFP technique. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found in the presence of the Q279R, P574R and -1562 C/T polymorphisms in terms of prostate biopsy results (p = 0.264, p = 0.406, p = 0.860, respectively), or Gleason score (p = 0.373, p = 0.367, p = 0.476). Comparing the genotypes of the Q279R, P574R and -1562 C/T polymorphisms resulting from prostate biopsy, using subgroups according to PSA values, no statistically significant differences were found either (p = 0.332 y p = 0.393, respectively ). However, statistically significant differences were found when comparing the genotypes of the -1562 C/T polymorphism of the MMP-9 in patients showing positive biopsy for malignant tumour in comparison to a negative biopsy for a malignant tumour in the subgroup of patients with PSA 10 ng/ml (p=0.049). The joint analysis of the three MMP-9 polymorphisms, using logistical regression study did not reveal any statistically significant differences as far as the risk of developing prostate cancer is concerned based on the presence of the Q279R, P574R and -1562 C/T polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: The Q279R, P574R and -1562 C/T polymorphisms are not linked with the aggressiveness in prostate cancer, neither they are linked to the risk of suffering prostate cancer.",0
9369446,Msx1 is present in thyrotropic cells and binds to a consensus site on the glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit promoter,"Our studies are aimed at identifying the transcription factors that activate the glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit promoter. Therefore, we performed a Southwestern screening of a thyrotropic (alphaTSH) cDNA expression library, using the region of the promoter from -490 to -310 that contains sequences critical for expression in thyrotrope cells. A clone was isolated corresponding to part of the coding sequence of Msx1, which is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that has been found to play an important role in the development of limb buds and craniofacial structures. Northern blot analysis, using the cloned Msx1 cDNA fragment as a probe, demonstrated that alpha-subunit-expressing thyrotrope cells (alphaTSH cells and TtT97 tumors) contained Msx1 RNA transcripts of 2.2 kb, while somatomammotrope (GH3) cells that do not produce the alpha-subunit had barely detectable levels. The presence of Msx1 protein was demonstrated by Western blot analysis in alphaTSH cells. We also demonstrated that transcripts encoding the closely related Msx2 factor were not detectable by Northern blot analysis in either thyrotrope or somatomammotrope-derived cells. Subfragments of the region from -490 to -310 of the alpha-subunit promoter were used in a Southwestern blot assay using bacterially produced Msx1 and demonstrated that binding was localized specifically to the region from -449 to -421. Deoxyribonuclease I protection analysis, using purified Msx1 homeodomain, demonstrated structurally induced differences in DNA digestion patterns between -436 and -413, and sequence analysis of this region revealed a direct repeat of the sequence GXAATTG, which is similar to the Msx1 consensus-binding site. When nucleotides at both sites were mutated, Msx1 binding was dramatically reduced, and the activity of an alpha-subunit promoter construct decreased by approximately 50% in transfected thyrotrope (alphaTSH) cells. These studies suggest that Msx1 may play a role in the expression of the alpha-subunit gene in thyrotrope cells.",1
2859120,A cellular gene encodes scrapie PrP 27-30 protein,"A clone encoding PrP 27-30, the major protein in purified preparations of scrapie agent, was selected from a scrapie-infected hamster brain cDNA library by oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the N terminus of the protein. Southern blotting with PrP cDNA revealed a single gene with the same restriction patterns in normal and scrapie-infected brain DNA. A single PrP-related gene was also detected in murine and human DNA. PrP-related mRNA was found at similar levels in normal and scrapie-infected hamster brain, as well as in many other normal tissues. Using antisera against PrP 27-30, a PrP-related protein was detected in crude extracts of infected brain and to a lesser extent in extracts of normal brain. Proteinase K digestion yielded PrP 27-30 in infected brain extract, but completely degraded the PrP-related protein in normal brain extract. No PrP-related nucleic acids were found in purified preparations of scrapie prions, indicating that PrP 27-30 is not encoded by a nucleic acid carried within the infectious particles.",1
25663851,Link between chronic inflammation and human papillomavirus-induced carcinogenesis (Review),"Inflammation is a defense strategy against invading agents and harmful molecules that is activated immediately following a stimulus, and involves the release of cytokines and chemokines, which activate the innate immune response. These mediators act together to increase blood flow and vascular permeability, facilitating recruitment of effector cells to the site of injury. Following resolution of the injury and removal of the stimulus, inflammation is disabled, but if the stimulus persists, inflammation becomes chronic and is strongly associated with cancer. This is likely to be due to the fact that the inflammation leads to a wound that does not heal, requiring a constant renewal of cells, which increases the risk of neoplastic transformation. Debris from phagocytosis, including the reactive species of oxygen and nitrogen that cause damage to DNA already damaged by the leukotrienes and prostaglandins, has an impact on inflammation and various carcinogenic routes. There is an association between chronic inflammation, persistent infection and cancer, where oncogenic action is mediated by autocrine and paracrine signals, causing changes in somatic cells under the influence of the microbial genome or of epigenetic factors. Among the infectious agents associated with cancer, certain genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) stand out. HPV is responsible for virtually all cases of cervical cancer and a lower proportion of cancers of the vagina, vulva, anus, penis and a number of extragenital cancers. In the present review, recent advances in the mechanisms involved in the inflammatory response are presented with their participation in the process of carcinogenesis, emphasizing the role of chronic inflammation in the development of HPV-induced cervical cancer.",0
10586968,Somatostatin reduces the meningeal arterial blood flow in the rat,"The effect of somatostatin (SOM) on neurogenic increases in meningeal blood flow was examined in barbiturate anaesthetized rats. The parietal skull was trepanized and the blood flow in the medial meningeal artery was monitored using a laser Doppler flowmeter with needle probes. Electrical stimulation (pulses of 8-10 V at 5-10 Hz for 30 s) close to the superior sagittal sinus evoked reproducible increases in blood flow. These increases were reduced by topical applications of SOM at concentrations of 10(-5)-10(-3) M in a dose-dependent manner. The effect was most pronounced within 10 min after application of SOM followed by a recovery of the flow responses. We conclude that stimulus-evoked increases in dural arterial flow, which are most likely caused by afferent activation and can be regarded as an element of neurogenic inflammation, are reduced by anti-inflammatory peptides such as SOM.",0

8767152,Evaluation of activity in intensive care. A comparison of administrative and epidemiologic data,"This paper reports on results of a formal comparison of data excerpted from 3 different data sources regarding patients cared for in Italian Intensive Care Units (ICU) in 1992. The analysis was carried out in order to assess whether the administrative data routinely collected for reimbursement and policy issues are valid when compared with data from epidemiologic studies. First, using data from the Central Service for Health Planning (SCPS) a general description of the whole national scenario is shown. All the Italian data from 265 Italian hospitals having at least one ICU were analyzed. In these hospitals there were 2,357 ICU beds (4.3 beds/1000 inhabitants, with large regional variability). About 100,000 cases were identified (1% of all the hospital admissions received ICU care at some moment during the stay), with an overall hospital mortality rate of 17%. This estimate was largely different from those obtained from GiViTI data base (5100 patients from a national sample of 114 ICUs), where mortality rates were always higher (25 and 30%, for ICU and hospital mortality). Second, a more detailed analyses and comparison was carried out in the subsample of cases admitted in the Hospitals of the Regione Lombardia. In this case, beside the data from SCPS (No = 20580) and from GiViTI (No = 1121), the Regional data-base formed by all the discharge from 41 hospitals having at least one ICU were available (NO = 16674), allowing a formal comparison between estimates obtained from 3 different sources. In this sub-sample, although administrative data showed a good capability and satisfactory accuracy to describe the volume and socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the cases when compared with GiViTI estimates, still a systematic underestimate of the overall ICU and hospital mortality was present. Moreover, an unexpected high rate of cases were apparently discharged alive from ICU (16.5 versus 32.6% in GiViTI). Tentative explanations and implications of these phenomena are discussed in the text. Finally, in the Lombardia sub-sample a formal description of the case-mix using the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) system was carried out in order to identify strengths and limitations of this approach when adopted in the ICU setting. Overall, when data are analyzed according to the kind of Major Diagnostic Category (MDC), 75% of all cases were concentrated in 5 alone, with very peculiar concentration in some specific categories. For example, 45% of all the hospital admissions related to the multiple trauma were actually admitted in the ICU setting. At DRG level, fifty of the 493 DRGs available explained 65% of all the cases, showing an unexpected capability of this system to detect the ICU case-mix. The most represented surgical DRG was the number 107 (Coronary Arterial Bypass Graft, without catheterization) and the corresponding medical was the 28 (Cerebro Vascular Accident, excluding TIA).",0
12935349,Deconvolving sequence variation in mixed DNA populations,"We present an original approach to identifying sequence variants in a mixed DNA population from sequence trace data. The heart of the method is based on parsimony: given a wildtype DNA sequence, a set of observed variations at each position collected from sequencing data, and a complete catalog of all possible mutations, determine the smallest set of mutations from the catalog that could fully explain the observed variations. The algorithmic complexity of the problem is analyzed for several classes of mutations, including block substitutions, single-range deletions, and single-range insertions. The reconstruction problem is shown to be NP-complete for single-range insertions and deletions, while for block substitutions, single character insertion, and single character deletion mutations, polynomial time algorithms are provided. Once a minimum set of mutations compatible with the observed sequence is found, the relative frequency of those mutations is recovered by solving a system of linear equations. Simulation results show the algorithm successfully deconvolving mutations in p53 known to cause cancer. An extension of the algorithm is proposed as a new method of high throughput screening for single nucleotide polymorphisms by multiplexing DNA.",0
7861130,"Cellular expression, developmental regulation, and phylogenic conservation of PEA-15, the astrocytic major phosphoprotein and protein kinase C substrate","PEA-15 has recently been identified as a major phosphoprotein in astrocytes and an endogenous substrate for protein kinase C. This 15-kDa protein exists under three molecular forms, an unphosphorylated form, N, and two phosphorylated forms, Pa and Pb. Antisera were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the internal sequences of the mouse protein containing the two specific phosphorylation sites and affinity-purified antibodies were used for immunoblotting. PEA-15 was found mainly in the cytosol, but its protein kinase C-phosphorylated form, Pb, was also detectable in association with the membrane and remained with the fraction that contains stabilized microtubules. Abundant in astrocytes, particularly in the hippocampus, PEA-15 was also detected in all cultured brain cell types examined, indicating a more ubiquitous distribution of the protein, further demonstrated by its detection in the eye and in the lung. Parallel to the increase in expression levels, phosphorylation of PEA-15 also increased during development. This paralleled results obtained in primary cultures, whereas PEA-15 levels increase with cell maturation. Finally, physiological importance of PEA-15 phosphorylation was illustrated by immunoreactivity observed in brain homogenates of different mammals, birds, amphibians, and fish.",0
20229183,Molecular characterization of a Chinese vaccine strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus: mutations that may contribute to attenuation,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), the etiological agent of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), is the major cause of viral enteritis and fetal diarrhea in swine neonates, resulting in significant economic losses to the swine industry. The Chinese vaccine strain H165 of TGEV was derived from a virulent field strain H16 by serial passage in vitro. Strain H165 has been proven to be safe in piglets and pregnant sows and displays efficacy against TGEV infection. In this study, we report the complete genome sequences of strains H165 and H16, obtained by sequencing several overlapping fragments amplified from viral RNA and our findings from sequence and phylogenetic analyses. The genomes were 28,569 nucleotides in length, including the poly (A) tail. No deletions or insertions were detected in the H16 genome sequence after continuous passage in vitro; however, we found 27 nucleotide mutations in strain H165 compared with strain H16, resulting in 16 amino acid changes distributed among the genes 1, S, 3, and sM. An A to G nucleotide mutation was found in the intergenic region between the 3a and 3b genes. Furthermore, six unique nucleotides identified in the genome sequence of H165 could be used as makers to differentiate the H165 vaccine strain from wild-type TGEV strains. Our findings from phylogenetic analysis may enhance our understanding of the evolution of TGEV, as well as the other coronaviruses.",0
31179489,"Comparison of diets enriched in stearic, oleic, and palmitic acids on inflammation, immune response, cardiometabolic risk factors, and fecal bile acid concentrations in mildly hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women-randomized crossover trial","BACKGROUND: Direct comparisons between SFAs varying in chain length, specifically palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0), relative to the latter's metabolic product, oleic acid (18:1), on cardiometabolic risk factors are limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the relative comparability of diets enriched in palmitic acid, stearic acid, and oleic acid on inflammation and coagulation markers, T lymphocyte proliferation/ex-vivo cytokine secretion, plasma cardiometabolic risk factors, and fecal bile acid concentrations. METHODS: Hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women (n = 20, mean +/- SD age 64 +/- 7 y, BMI 26.4 +/- 3.4 kg/m2, LDL cholesterol >/= 2.8 mmol/L) were provided with each of 3 diets [55% energy (%E) carbohydrate, 15%E protein, 30%E fat, with  approximately 50% fat contributed by palmitic acid, stearic acid, or oleic acid in each diet; 5 wk/diet phase] using a randomized crossover design with 2-wk washouts between phases. Outcome measures were assessed at the end of each phase. RESULTS: Fasting LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol concentrations were lower after the stearic acid and oleic acid diets than the palmitic acid diet (all P < 0.01). Fasting HDL-cholesterol concentrations were lower after the stearic acid diet than the palmitic acid and oleic acid diets (P < 0.01). The stearic acid diet resulted in lower lithocholic acid (P = 0.01) and total secondary bile acid (SBA) concentrations (P = 0.04) than the oleic acid diet. All other outcome measures were similar between diets. Lithocholic acid concentrations were positively correlated with fasting LDL-cholesterol concentrations (r = 0.33; P = 0.011). Total SBA, lithocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid concentrations were negatively correlated with fasting HDL cholesterol (r = -0.51 to -0.44; P < 0.01) concentrations and positively correlated with LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol (r = 0.37-0.54; P < 0.01) ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary stearic acid and oleic acid had similar effects on fasting LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol concentrations and more favorable ones than palmitic acid. Unlike oleic acid, the hypocholesterolemic effect of stearic acid may be mediated by inhibition of intestinal hydrophobic SBA synthesis. These findings add to the data suggesting there should be a reassessment of current SFA dietary guidance and Nutrient Facts panel labeling.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02145936.",0
12163476,Cast: a novel protein of the cytomatrix at the active zone of synapses that forms a ternary complex with RIM1 and munc13-1,"The cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) has been implicated in defining the site of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitter. We have identified here a novel CAZ protein of approximately 120 kD from rat brain and named it CAST (CAZ-associated structural protein). CAST had no transmembrane segment, but had four coiled-coil domains and a putative COOH-terminal consensus motif for binding to PDZ domains. CAST was localized at the CAZ of conventional synapses of mouse brain. CAST bound directly RIM1 and indirectly Munc13-1, presumably through RIM1, forming a ternary complex. RIM1 and Munc13-1 are CAZ proteins implicated in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of neurotansmitters. Bassoon, another CAZ protein, was also associated with this ternary complex. These results suggest that a network of protein-protein interactions among the CAZ proteins exists at the CAZ. At the early stages of synapse formation, CAST was expressed and partly colocalized with bassoon in the axon shaft and the growth cone. The vesicles immunoisolated by antibassoon antibody-coupled beads contained not only bassoon but also CAST and RIM1. These results suggest that these CAZ proteins are at least partly transported on the same vesicles during synapse formation.",1
29438784,"Novel antibody-cytokine fusion proteins featuring granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interleukin-3 and interleukin-4 as payloads","Neutrophils can strongly influence disease activity in cancer and in chronic inflammation. Here, we report for the first time the construction and characterization of antibody-fusion proteins featuring granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and interleukin-3 as payloads capable of enhancing neutrophil activity and a novel antibody-interleukin-4 fusion protein with neutrophil inhibitory potential. We used the F8 antibody specific to the alternatively-spliced extra domain A (EDA) of fibronectin as a targeting agent, since the cognate antigen is strongly upregulated in diseases characterized by angiogenesis. The fusion proteins GCSF-F8, F8-IL3 and F8-IL4-F8, were cloned, expressed, and their targeting ability assessed, exhibiting preferential tumor uptake with tumor:blood ratios at 24h after injection of 3.3, 18.2 and 27.3, respectively. In F9 tumor bearing-mice GCSF-F8 and F8-IL3 did not provide a therapeutic benefit, while F8-IL4-F8 showed a potent tumor growth retardation. In the collagen-induced model of arthritis, GCSF-F8 and F8-IL3 induced a worsening of the disease, while F8-IL4-F8 slowed arthritis progression but, surprisingly, exhibited substantial toxicity when used in combination with dexamethasone. Collectively, the results indicate that the novel fusion proteins could be expressed and efficiently delivered to the site of disease. However, they were not superior to other antibody-cytokine fusions previously described by our laboratory.",0

15112360,Expression of tumor related gene NAG6 in gastric cancer and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis,"AIM: NAG6 gene is a novel tumor related gene identified recently. This study was designed to examine the expression of this gene in gastric cancer and corresponding normal tissues, and to investigate its role in the occurrence and development of gastric cancer, also to study if the genetic structure of NAG6 was altered in gastric cancer. METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Northern blot analysis and dot hybridization were used to compare the expression level of NAG6 gene in 42 cases of gastric cancer tissues with their corresponding normal tissues of the same patients respectively. In addition, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was adopted to study if the genetic structure of NAG6 was altered in gastric carcinomas. RESULTS: The expression of NAG6 in 57.1% gastric cancer tissues (25/42) was absent by RT-PCR analysis. The down-regulation rate of NAG6 in gastric cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in corresponding normal tissues (P<0.01). However no correlation between the down-regulation of NAG6 and lymph-node and/or distance metastasis was found in this study (P>0.05). Dot hybridization confirmed the results of RT-PCR. Furthermore, the results of EcoRI RFLP analysis of NAG6 gene demonstrated that 3 of 7 cases of gastric cancer showed loss of 5 kb fragment in comparison with their corresponding normal tissues. CONCLUSION: NAG6 gene is significantly down regulated in gastric cancer. The loss of genetic materials may be the cause of down-regulation of NAG6 expression. This seems to suggest that NAG6 may represent a candidate of putative tumor suppressor gene at 7q31-32 loci associated with gastric carcinoma. The down-regulation of this gene may play a role in occurrence and development of this disease, however it may not be associated with lymph node and/or distance metastasis.",1
14636941,Feasibility study of the use of a daily electronic mail reminder to improve oral contraceptive compliance,"Women who ingest their oral contraceptive pill (OCP) as part of a daily routine are more likely use their OCPs correctly. This trial examines the feasibility of an electronic-mail (e-mail) reminder system to improve OCP compliance. An e-mail reminder was sent to 50 new OCP users daily for 3 months. Subjects sent an e-mail reply to confirm receipt. OCP compliance was recorded on diaries. Four subjects were discontinued for not checking their e-mail. Active participants missed a median of 18% of the e-mail reminders (range: 0-65%). A follow-up visit was scheduled after completion of three OCP cycles. Of the 40 subjects returning completed diaries, 50% missed no active pills at all and 20% missed at least one in each cycle. Most found the daily e-mail somewhat (65%) or very helpful (19%) for OCP compliance. Of those continuing OCPs, 64% wanted to continue receiving e-mail reminders at the completion of the study. Because inconsistent OCP use is a significant cause of unplanned conception, the use of e-mail to improve OCP compliance has the potential to decrease unintended pregnancies.",0
29596837,"Lipidomics biomarker studies: Errors, limitations, and the future","Lipidomics is an ever-expanding subfield of metabolomics that surveys 3000 to 5000 individual lipids across more than 56 lipid subclasses, including lipid peroxidation products. Unfortunately, there exists a large number of publications with poor quality data obtained with unit mass resolution leading to many lipid misidentifications. This is further complicated by poor scientific oversight with regard to recognition of isobar issues, sample collection, and sample storage issues that inexplicably requires more detailed attention. Inadvertent or intentional obfuscation of relative quantification data represented as absolute quantification is a subtle but profound difference that may readers outside of the field may not realize, therefore, instigating disservice and unnecessary distrust in the scientific community. These issues need to be addressed aggressively as high quality data are essential for the translation of biomarker research to clinical practice.",0
15004200,Survivin enhances Fas ligand expression via up-regulation of specificity protein 1-mediated gene transcription in colon cancer cells,"Cancer cells are thought to possess mechanisms for evading the host's immune surveillance system. Survivin, a member of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis family overexpressed by cancer cells, inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis induced by immune cells. In addition, cancer cells express Fas ligand (FasL) on their surfaces as a counterattack against immune cells. Mechanisms by which cancer cells express FasL, including involvement of survivin, are unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that survivin up-regulated FasL expression and investigated how this might occur. Quantitative immunostaining showed correlation between survivin and FasL protein expression in colon cancer tissues (r=0.79). FasL expression was up-regulated in LS180 colon cancer cells transfected with the survivin gene. Transfectants showed increased cytotoxicity against a Fas-sensitive human T leukemia cell line, Jurkat. In contrast, FasL expression was down-regulated in SW480 cells transfected with a small inhibitory RNA to prevent survivin expression. Survivin gene transfectants showed increased DNA binding of transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) to the FasL promoter, and up-regulation of Sp1 phosphorylation at serine and threonine residues; the total amount of Sp1 was unchanged. Thus, survivin enables cancer cells not only to suppress immune cell attack by inhibiting Fas-mediated apoptotic signaling, but to attack immune cells by induction of FasL.",1
599740,The mechanism of Ca2+ action on the healing-over process in mammalian cardiac muscles: a kinetic analysis,"The effect of Ca2+ concentration and temperature on the recovery of membrane potential after investigating lesions using sucrose-gap technique in the guinea-pig papillary muscles were studied. At certain temperatures, this recovery showed increased accerelation with increasing Ca2+ concentration. The relation between rate constant of the recovery and Ca2+ concentration was quite similar to that of the reaction between an enzyme and substrate. This relationship could be expressed by the equation Y = xn(Km + xn), where Y is the normalized rate constant and x the Ca2+ concentration. The coefficient, n, was evaluated by performing Hill's plot. The value of n largely changed between 1 and ca. 2 at 32 degrees C--37 degrees C. The input resistance fell at the instant of formation of a lesion and started to rise with recovery of membrane potential. The resistance change after lesion formation was also observed in the potassium-Tyrode's solution in which Na+ was substituted with K+. The concentration-rate relationship of Ca2+ in the healing-over seems to indicate that Ca2+ binds to some molecules in the junctional membrane and produce a structural change of intercalated disc which brings about the healing-over. The large change of n suggests that Ca2+ has a cooperative action in the healing-over process, or alternatively that the state of membrane lipids has some effect on the process.",0
6397224,Intrinsic zinc ion is essential for proper conformation of active Escherichia coli RNA polymerase,"The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RPase) from Escherichia coli contained 2 mol of Zn/mol of holoenzyme (alpha 2 beta beta' sigma). An in vitro protocol involving sequential denaturation of RPase in 8 M urea and low pH (2.2), in the presence of 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), was developed to completely remove the two intrinsic Zn ions. Subsequent reconstitution of the denatured, Zn-free RPase in the absence and presence of 10(-5) approximately 10(-4) M ZnCl2 yielded respectively the inactive apoenzyme and active (50 +/- 10%) RPase containing one Zn ion (rec-Zn1-RPase). Active rec-Cd1-RPase was similarly obtained when CdCl2 instead of ZnCl2 was used in the reconstitution. The use of 65Zn as a tracer in the two-step reconstitution procedure showed that the metal was incorporated into renatured enzyme only in the last step of reconstitution. The subunit location of the incorporated metal was identified to be in the beta subunit by the use of Affi-Gel Blue column chromatography of rec-Cd1-RPase. The analysis of apo- and rec-Zn1-RPases by sucrose density gradient sedimentation showed that the inactive apo-RPase appeared to be consisted of randomly folded protein species with S20,w values ranging from 5 to 18 S, while rec-Zn1-RPase contained a major, active 13S RPase species and a minor, inactive 7.9S species that could be separated by DNA-cellulose column chromatography. Both 13S and 7.9S RPase contained 1 mol of Zn and the five subunits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
8495384,Inhibition of peripheral fast synaptic inputs to celiac ganglion neurons by splanchnic preganglionic fibers in the cat,Fast nicotinic transmission was studied in vitro in isolated cat celiac ganglion neurons using intracellular recording techniques. Fast synaptic activation was evoked by stimulation (0.1 Hz) of the anterior peripheral rami. A long-lasting inhibition of this response was triggered by repetitive splanchnic stimulation (30-50 Hz) for 10 s. Evidence is given that this inhibition occurs at presynaptic level. Our results indicate that central inputs modulate transmission of fast synaptic peripheral inputs to prevertebral ganglionic neurons. This would be another integrative mechanism in the prevertebral ganglia.,0
23839332,The angiopoietin-like protein 3: a hepatokine with expanding role in metabolism,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cumulating evidence are revealing roles of angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) in lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism. In this review, we discuss the recent developments in understanding the specific role in metabolic processes of the liver-derived ANGPTL3. RECENT FINDINGS: Several groups have reported clinical and metabolic characterization of individuals with loss-of-function variants in ANGPTL3 showing familial combined hypolipidemia, a syndrome characterized by marked reduction of all plasma lipoproteins. Their findings indicate that in humans, ANGPTL3 has a broader action on apoB and apoA-I-containing lipoproteins, as well as on free fatty acid and adipose tissue metabolism. SUMMARY: The identification of loss-of-function ANGPTL3 mutation is shedding light on a possible role of ANGPTL3 at the crossroads of lipoproteins, fatty acids, and glucose metabolism, thus making ANGPTL3 an attractive protein to target the cardio-metabolic risk.",1

PURPOSE: To explore health care providers' perspectives on management of skin and soft tissue infections to gain a better understanding of the problems faced by busy providers in primary care settings. METHODS: Focus group meetings were held at 9 family physician offices in the Iowa Research Network. Seventy-eight clinicians including physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, and house officers attended. Meeting audiotapes were transcribed and coded by 3 investigators, and a MRSA-management taxonomy was developed. FINDINGS: The main themes that emerged from the focus groups included epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, management, prevention, special populations, and public relations. The incidence of MRSA infections was perceived to have increased over the past decade. However, diagnosis and treatment protocols for physicians in the outpatient setting have lagged behind, and no well-accepted diagnostic or treatment algorithms were used by physicians attending the focus groups. CONCLUSION: The clinicians in this study noted considerable confusion and inconsistency in the management of skin and soft tissue infections, particularly those due to MRSA.",0
20733092,"Trends in time to confirmation and recognition of new-onset hypertension, 2002-2006","Achieving full benefits of blood pressure control in populations requires prompt recognition of previously undetected hypertension. In 2003, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure provided definitions of hypertension and recommended that single elevated readings be confirmed within 1 to 2 months. We sought to determine whether the time required to confirm and recognize (ie, diagnose and/or treat) new-onset hypertension decreased from 2002 to 2006 for adult members of 2 large integrated healthcare delivery systems, Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Colorado. Using electronically stored office blood pressure readings, physician diagnoses, and pharmacy prescriptions, we identified 200 587 patients with new-onset hypertension (2002-2006) marked by 2 consecutive elevated blood pressure readings in previously undiagnosed, untreated members. Mean confirmation intervals (time from the first to second consecutive elevated reading) declined steadily from 103 to 89 days during this period. For persons recognized within 12 months after confirmation, the mean interval to recognition declined from 78 to 61 days. However, only 33% of individuals were recognized within 12 months. One third were never recognized during observed follow-up. For these patients, most subsequent blood pressure recordings were not elevated. Higher initial blood pressure levels, history of previous cardiovascular disease, and older age were associated with shorter times to recognition. Times to confirmation and recognition of new-onset hypertension have become shorter in recent years, especially for patients with higher cardiovascular disease risk. Variability in office-based blood pressure readings suggests that further improvements in recognition and treatment may be achieved with more specific automated approaches to identifying hypertension.",0
2069907,A chromosome 12 coding region is juxtaposed to the MYC protooncogene locus in a t(8;12)(q24;q22) translocation in a case of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"We performed molecular cloning and sequencing of the breakpoints of a new chromosomal translocation involving the MYC protooncogene locus. This secondary t(8;12)(q24;q22) was associated with a primary t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation in a case of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in blastic transformation. In this leukemia, Northern blot and nuclease analyses SI showed that MYC was strongly expressed with initiation of the transcription at both the 5' and 3' promoters as observed in Burkitt's lymphomas; no coding change was observed in MYC putative regulatory sequences. The breakpoint on chromosome 8 mapped to the 3' end of the MYC locus, in a region containing a potential Z-DNA tract, and where we identified two DNase 1 hypersensitive sites. A rearranged MYC gene fragment was cloned and shown to contain chromosome 12 information by Southern blot analysis and by in situ hybridization. A genomic probe subcloned from the isolated region of the chromosome 12 recognized a 1.8 kb transcript in virtually all the tissues tested but a preferential expression of this new gene, which we termed BTG1 (for B-cell translocation gene 1) was observed in the CLL cells and in tissues of lymphoid origin. This chromosome 12 coding sequence is conserved in evolution and a transcript of similar size is present in murine tissues.",1
33108789,The Liver in COVID-19-Related Death: Protagonist or Innocent Bystander?,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), involves several organs through participation of angiotensin-conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. The presence of ACE2 receptors in the liver renders this organ a potential target for the novel coronavirus. METHODS: We performed 14 complete autopsies of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In each case we stained liver tissue sections with haematoxylin/eosin, Masson blue trichrome stain, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Perls, and performed cytokeratin-7 (CK7) immunochemistry. RESULTS: Macroscopically, livers were pale and yellowish in 8 of 14 (57%) patients, and had a nutmeg appearance in the other 6 cases (42%). Histologically, centrolobular necrosis was observed in 12 cases (86%), and was associated with discreet to moderate lobular or portal inflammation. Steatosis was seen in 8 cases (57%), but fibrosis was rare. Cholestasis and discrete bile duct proliferation was observed in 5 cases (36%). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The main histological changes can be explained by the hypoxic status as a result of severe hypoxemic pneumonia leading to death. Drug toxicity may also play a role in certain cases. Other histological changes may be explained by previous hepatic conditions or underlying hepatic diseases. We concluded that COVID-19 infection was not associated with a specific histopathological pattern of the liver.",0
9677380,Involvement of microphthalmia in the inhibition of melanocyte lineage differentiation and of melanogenesis by agouti signal protein,"In mouse follicular melanocytes, production of eumelanins (brown-black pigments) and pheomelanins (yellow-brownish pigments) is under the control of two intercellular signaling molecules that exert opposite actions, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alphaMSH) which preferentially increases the synthesis of eumelanins, and agouti signal protein (ASP) whose expression favors the production of hair containing pheomelanins. In this study, we report that ASP does not only affect mature melanocytes but can also inhibit the differentiation of melanoblasts. We show that both alphaMSH and forskolin promote the differentiation of murine melanoblasts into mature melanocytes and that ASP inhibits this process. We present evidence that the expression of a specific melanogenic transcription factor, microphthalmia, and its binding to an M box regulatory element, is inhibited by ASP. We also show that, in B16 murine melanoma cells, ASP inhibits alphaMSH-stimulated expression of tyrosinase, tyrosine-related proteins 1 and 2 through an inhibition of the transcription activity of their respective promoters. Further, ASP inhibits alphaMSH-induced expression of the microphthalmia gene and reduces the level of microphthalmia in the cells. Our data demonstrate that ASP can regulate both melanoblast differentiation and melanogenesis, pointing out the key role of microphthalmia in the control of these processes.",1
23583738,Variants of the electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter 1 (NBCe1) in mouse hippocampal neurons are regulated by extracellular pH changes: evidence for a Rab8a-dependent mechanism,"Changes in extracellular pH are common events in both pathological conditions and during normal brain function. In organs other than the brain, cells may respond to pH changes by trafficking of acid-base transporters. However, regulation of neuronal acid-base transporters during pH shifts is not understood. The aim of this study was to investigate regulatory mechanisms of the variants of the electrogenic sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter 1, NBCe1-A and NBCe1-B/C, in neurons following changes of extracellular pH. Therefore, primary mouse hippocampal neurons were exposed to extracellular acidosis or alkalosis. We show that acid-base changes regulated trafficking and membrane expression of neuronal NBCe1 but the underlying molecular cues were distinct for individual NBCe1 variants. Following extracellular acidosis NBCe1-A was recruited from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane, followed by increased membrane expression, whereas NBCe1-B/C was retrieved from the membrane. Extracellular alkalosis had no impact on NBCe1-A, but caused translocation of NBCe1-B/C toward the dendrites. We also show that acidosis-induced NBCe1-A, but not NBCe1-B/C, trafficking is mediated by Rab8a. Rab8a is expressed in hippocampal neurons, co-localizes, and interacts with NBCe1-A. Loss-of-function of Rab8a using specific siRNA prevented acidosis-induced redistribution of NBCe1-A. These data propose opposite recruitment pattern for NBCe1 variants in neurons following extracellular acid-base changes, implicating distinct physiological functions of individual NBCe1 variants, and introduce Rab8a as a novel molecular determinant and crucial mediator of acidosis-induced NBCe1 trafficking in neurons.",0
17015467,Long-term memory deficits in Pavlovian fear conditioning in Ca2+/calmodulin kinase kinase alpha-deficient mice,"Signaling by the Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase (CaMK) cascade has been implicated in neuronal gene transcription, synaptic plasticity, and long-term memory consolidation. The CaM kinase kinase alpha (CaMKKalpha) isoform is an upstream component of the CaMK cascade whose function in different behavioral and learning and memory paradigms was analyzed by targeted gene disruption in mice. CaMKKalpha mutants exhibited normal long-term spatial memory formation and cued fear conditioning but showed deficits in context fear during both conditioning and long-term follow-up testing. They also exhibited impaired activation of the downstream kinase CaMKIV/Gr and its substrate, the transcription factor cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) upon fear conditioning. Unlike CaMKIV/Gr-deficient mice, the CaMKKalpha mutants exhibited normal long-term potentiation and normal levels of anxiety-like behavior. These results demonstrate a selective role for CaMKKalpha in contextual fear memory and suggest that different combinations of upstream and downstream components of the CaMK cascade may serve distinct physiological functions.",1
24110554,Wavelet-sparsity based regularization over time in the inverse problem of electrocardiography,"Noninvasive, detailed assessment of electrical cardiac activity at the level of the heart surface has the potential to revolutionize diagnostics and therapy of cardiac pathologies. Due to the requirement of noninvasiveness, body-surface potentials are measured and have to be projected back to the heart surface, yielding an ill-posed inverse problem. Ill-posedness ensures that there are non-unique solutions to this problem, resulting in a problem of choice. In the current paper, it is proposed to restrict this choice by requiring that the time series of reconstructed heart-surface potentials is sparse in the wavelet domain. A local search technique is introduced that pursues a sparse solution, using an orthogonal wavelet transform. Epicardial potentials reconstructed from this method are compared to those from existing methods, and validated with actual intracardiac recordings. The new technique improves the reconstructions in terms of smoothness and recovers physiologically meaningful details. Additionally, reconstruction of activation timing seems to be improved when pursuing sparsity of the reconstructed signals in the wavelet domain. ",0
32406538,Technical Note: New similarity index for radiotherapy and medical imaging,"PURPOSE: To describe a new similarity index and consider its biomedical applications. METHODS: Similarity index for a pair of objects is defined by the number of shared features and total number of features in these objects. Similarity measure for more than two objects is commonly defined by using pairwise similarity indices. In the current study we suggest a novel similarity index which depends on the number of features shared between multiple objects and does not have the limitations of the recently described similarity measures. In order to introduce the new index, we consider a concept of ",0

10539825,Lack of effect of recent alcohol consumption on the course of acute myocardial infarction,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alcohol has marked effects on hemodynamic and hemostatic variables that might alter the presentation of acute myocardial infarction that follows its use. We sought to determine whether recent alcohol consumption alters the course or complications of acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: In the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study, we performed chart reviews and face-to-face interviews with 2161 patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy. We assessed alcohol use before infarction, peak creatine kinase levels (1043 patients), electrocardiographic interpretations (1408 patients), and the presence of ventricular arrhythmias or congestive heart failure (all patients). RESULTS: Among the 2161 patients, 399 (18.5%) drank alcohol within 24 hours before myocardial infarction. We found no significant difference in mean peak creatine kinase level between those who had recently used alcohol and those who had not in an adjusted comparison (-6.1% difference; 95% confidence interval [CI] -20.3%-10.7%; P =.46). We also found no differences in adjusted risk for Q-wave infarction, congestive heart failure, or ventricular arrhythmias (odds ratios 1.03 [95% CI, 0.73-1.45; P =.88], 1.01 [95% CI, 0.67-1.54; P =.95], and 1.04 [95% CI, 0.66-1.65; P =.86]). Categorization of the duration since last alcohol use into 6-hour intervals revealed no trends between time since last use of alcohol and any of these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Recent alcohol use is not associated with changes in infarct size or risk for Q-wave infarction, congestive heart failure, or ventricular arrhythmia among this population.",0
24648371,Report of a newly indentified patient with mutations in BMP1 and underlying pathogenetic aspects,"Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic condition characterized by bone fragility and recurrent fractures, which in the large majority of patients are caused by defects in the production of type I collagen. Mutations in the gene encoding bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1, also known as procollagen C-endopeptidase) have been associated with osteogenesis imperfecta in two sib pairs. In this report, we describe an additional patient with osteogenesis imperfecta with normal bone density and a recurrent, homozygous c.34G>C mutation in BMP1. Western blot analysis of dermal fibroblasts from this patient showed decreased protein levels of the two alternatively spliced products of BMP1 and abnormal cleavage of the C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen. In addition, fluorescence and electron microscopy showed impaired assembly of type I collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix of cultured fibroblasts derived from two patients: the patient described here and a previously reported patient with a homozygous BMP1 c.747C>G mutation. We conclude that BMP1 is essential for human type I collagen fibrilogenesis.",1
18814304,Relationships between patient-centered cancer nursing interventions and desired health outcomes in the context of the health care system,"A non-experimental longitudinal prospective study was conducted to examine the relationships between patient-centered nursing interventions (PCNIs), system characteristics, patient characteristics, and desired health outcomes (DHOs) for 173 hematology-oncology patients. Forty-nine nurse participants provided system characteristics data. Confirmatory factor analyses yielded parsimonious scales to operationalize the variables. In the path model, one PCNI-individualization-was positively related to three subsequent DHOs: authentic self-representation, optimism, and sense of well-being. Two additional PCNIs-responsiveness and proficiency-were positively related to subsequent trust in nurses. PCNIs did not vary with patient race, ethnicity, age, gender, or educational level. Patient-centeredness of care for cancer patients may be enhanced by quality improvement activities that measure and monitor these PCNIs and resultant outcomes.",0
23374270,"Deficiency of caspase recruitment domain family, member 11 (CARD11), causes profound combined immunodeficiency in human subjects","BACKGROUND: Profound combined immunodeficiency can present with normal numbers of T and B cells, and therefore the functional defect of the cellular and humoral immune response is often not recognized until the first severe clinical manifestation. Here we report a patient of consanguineous descent presenting at 13 months of age with hypogammaglobulinemia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and a suggestive family history. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify the genetic alteration in a patient with combined immunodeficiency and characterize human caspase recruitment domain family, member 11 (CARD11), deficiency. METHODS: Molecular, immunologic, and functional assays were performed. RESULTS: The immunologic characterization revealed only subtle changes in the T-cell and natural killer cell compartment, whereas B-cell differentiation, although normal in number, was distinctively blocked at the transitional stage. Genetic evaluation revealed a homozygous deletion of exon 21 in CARD11 as the underlying defect. This deletion abrogated protein expression and activation of the canonical nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway in lymphocytes after antigen receptor or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation, whereas CD40 signaling in B cells was preserved. The abrogated activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway was associated with severely impaired upregulation of inducible T-cell costimulator, OX40, cytokine production, proliferation of T cells, and B cell-activating factor receptor expression on B cells. CONCLUSION: Thus in patients with CARD11 deficiency, the combination of impaired activation and especially upregulation of inducible T-cell costimulator on T cells, together with severely disturbed peripheral B-cell differentiation, apparently leads to a defective T-cell/B-cell cooperation and probably germinal center formation and clinically results in severe immunodeficiency. This report discloses the crucial and nonredundant role of canonical NF-kappaB activation and specifically CARD11 in the antigen-specific immune response in human subjects.",1
29362496,The microRNA regulatory landscape of MSC-derived exosomes: a systems view,"Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes mediate tissue regeneration in a variety of diseases including ischemic heart injury, liver fibrosis, and cerebrovascular disease. Despite an increasing number of studies reporting the therapeutic effects of MSC exosomes, the underlying molecular mechanisms and their miRNA complement are poorly characterized. Here we microRNA (miRNA)-profiled MSC exosomes and conducted a network analysis to identify the dominant biological processes and pathways modulated by exosomal miRNAs. At a system level, miRNA-targeted genes were enriched for (cardio)vascular and angiogenesis processes in line with observed cardiovascular regenerative effects. Targeted pathways were related to Wnt signaling, pro-fibrotic signaling via TGF-beta and PDGF, proliferation, and apoptosis. When tested, MSC exosomes reduced collagen production by cardiac fibroblasts, protected cardiomyocytes from apoptosis, and increased angiogenesis in HUVECs. The intrinsic beneficial effects were further improved by virus-free enrichment of MSC exosomes with network-informed regenerative miRNAs capable of promoting angiogenesis and cardiomyocyte proliferation. The data presented here help define the miRNA landscape of MSC exosomes, establish their biological functions through network analyses at a system level, and provide a platform for modulating the overall phenotypic effects of exosomes.",0

Enzymically active lysozyme in pure form was obtained in practically quantitative yields. The method was used to quantify the lysozyme content and to determine its distribution between the sol and gel phases of the secretion, which were separated by centrifugation. It was shown that lysozyme is concentrated in the mucin-containing gel phase, from which it can be liberated with high concentrations of salt. Evidence supporting an electrostatic binding mechanism between mucin and lysozyme is presented.",0
8627565,Transport characteristics of differently charged cephalosporin antibiotics in oocytes expressing the cloned intestinal peptide transporter PepT1 and in human intestinal Caco-2 cells,"To investigate whether multiple peptide transporters mediate absorption of beta-lactams carrying different charges at physiological pH, we used the human intestinal cell line Caco-2 and Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the cloned rabbit intestinal peptide transporter PepT1. Characteristics of transport of the anionic cefixime and the zwitterionic cefadroxil were assessed by 1) flux studies using radiolabeled compounds, by 2) measuring changes in pHin in cells and oocytes as a consequence of substrate-mediated proton influx and 3) by applying the two-electrode voltage clamp technique to assess the electrophysiological phenomena associated with beta-lactam transport in oocytes expressing PepT1. Both beta-lactams were rapidly taken up into Caco-2 cells and oocytes expressing PepT1 by a pH-dependent and saturable transport pathway. Mutual inhibition suggested that acidic and zwitterionic compounds may share a common transporter. Cefixime and cefadroxil caused a significant decline in intracellular pH as a consequence of proton coupled substrate influx. Uptake of cefixime and cefadroxil via PepT1 expressed in oocytes was electrogenic indicating that transport of both beta-lactams is associated with movement of net positive charge. The more acidic pH required for rheogenic cefixime uptake in both cell systems, when compared to cefadroxil uptake in both cell systems, when compared to cefadroxil uptake, and the concomitant faster intracellular acidification indicates that cefixime most likely is taken up only in its nonionized form with an additional proton being cotransported. This is supported by the observation that cefixime uptake at different pH correlated significantly with the percentage of the nonionized species being present. From our studies we conclude that a single peptide transport system can mediate electrogenic uptake of the neutral form of beta-lactam antibiotics into intestinal epithelial cells.",0
9639441,Transforming growth factor beta2 in the vitreous in proliferative diabetic retinopathy,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that transforming growth factor beta2 (TGF-beta2) is involved in the cause of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). METHODS: We assayed TGF-beta2 levels in the vitreous of patients with PDR and other vitreoretinal disorders. Forty-nine vitreous specimens were obtained from eyes of patients with PDR undergoing vitrectomy, and 19 vitreous specimens from nondiabetic subjects served as controls. We assessed TGF-beta2 levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both mature and total TGF-beta2 levels were quantified. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) total levels of TGF-beta2 were 2634 (+/- 1652) pg/mL in the patients with PDR and 1305 (+/- 972) pg/mL in controls. The mean (+/- SD) levels of mature TGF-beta2 were 244 (+/- 316) pg/mL in patients with PDR and 79 (+/- 81) pg/mL in controls. Total and mature TGF-beta2 levels were significantly greater in patients with PDR (total TGF-beta2, P <.001; mature TGF-beta2, P <.01). Mature TGF-beta2 levels were higher in the vitreous of patients who had severe fibrous proliferation. CONCLUSION: The results indicate increased levels of both total and mature TGF-beta2 in the vitreous of patients with PDR, suggesting that TGF-beta2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PDR.",0
24851590,"Carbon balance in municipal solid waste management--a case study of Nonthaburi municipality, Thailand","OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to investigate the carbon equivalences associated with the unit processes of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) in Nonthaburi municipality. In addition, factors affecting MSWM's carbon-related activities were determined to find the reduction potential of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Afield survey was conducted to quantify the amount of resources used in MSWM. Then, they were evaluated in terms of carbon equivalences occurring in the process scheme and categorized into carbon emissions, fixation and reduction,following a carbon-balanced model. RESULTS: From carbon balance analysis of the base-line-scenario MSWM, the carbon emissions were found to be -2,374.56 MTCE/y, resulting in the average carbon unit of-22.98 kg CE/ton solid waste. The negative sign indicates a carbon reduction, instead of an emission,from this MSWM practice, which helps to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. CONCLUSION: The results of the model reveal that the highest contribution to carbon reduction potential in MSWM is recycling. Accordingly, it is strongly recommended that a policy promoting reuse, recovery, and recycling be pursued in every step of MSWM to assist in, not only extending landfill service life span, but also alleviating the increasing global warming problems.",0

15983387,"Frag1, a homolog of alternative replication factor C subunits, links replication stress surveillance with apoptosis","We report the identification and characterization of a potent regulator of genomic integrity, mouse and human FRAG1 gene, a conserved homolog of replication factor C large subunit that is homologous to the alternative replication factor C subunits Elg1, Ctf18/Chl12, and Rad24 of budding yeast. FRAG1 was identified in a search for key caretaker genes involved in the regulation of genomic stability under conditions of replicative stress. In response to stress, Atr participates in the down-regulation of FRAG1 expression, leading to the induction of apoptosis through the release of Rad9 from damaged chromatin during the S phase of the cell cycle, allowing Rad9-Bcl2 association and induction of proapoptotic Bax protein. We propose that the Frag1 signal pathway, by linking replication stress surveillance with apoptosis induction, plays a central role in determining whether DNA damage is compatible with cell survival or whether it requires cell elimination by apoptosis.",1
24420463,Temperature-dependent changes in Photosystem II heterogeneity support a cycle of Photosystem II during photoinhibition,"High light treatments were given to attached leaves of pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) at room temperature and at 1 degrees C where the diffusion- and enzyme-dependent repair processes of Photosystem II are at a minimum. After treatments, electron transfer activities and fluorescence induction were measured from thylakoids isolated from the treated leaves. When the photoinhibition treatment was given at 1 degrees C, the Photosystem II electron transfer assays that were designed to require electron transfer to the plastoquinone pool showed greater inhibition than electron transfer from H2O to paraphenyl-benzoquinone, which measures all PS II centers. When the light treatment was given at room temperature, electron transfer from H2O to paraphenyl-benzoquinone was inhibited more than whole-chain electron transfer. Variable fluorescence measured in the presence of ferricyanide decreased only during room-temperature treatments. These results suggest that reaction centers of one pool of Photosystem II, non-QB-PS II, replace photoinhibited reaction centers at room temperature, while no replacement occurs at 1 degrees C. A simulation of photoinhibition at 1 degrees C supports this conclusion. ",0
518264,Endurance training and cardiovascular function in 9-and 10-year-old boys,"Thirty-two boys, 9 and 10 years old, were randomly divided into experimental and control groups in order to investigate cardiovascular responses to interval cycle training. The experimental group exercised on a cycle ergometer 5 days a week during their physical education periods. There were 4 work bouts of 4 minutes each, separated by 3-minute recovery intervals each day for 8 weeks. Loads were prescribed so that heart rates ranged from 170 to 195 for each bout (80--90% estimated maximum). The control group took part in a traditional sports-oriented physical education period during this time. Pretest steady-state values at HR130 were determined for oxygen consumption, heart rate, and cardiac output, after which the load was progressively increased to determine physical work capacity at heart rate 170. The tests were repeated after the 8-week training period, at work loads identical to pretest values. Analysis of covariance revealed that significant improvements in the experimental group occurred in stroke volume and oxygen pulse. The 6.5% increase in stroke volume was countered by a 6.8% decrease in heart rate, resulting in no differences in cardiac output. Increases in physical work capacity occurred in each group, but only that of the experimental group was significant. No differences were detected for either group in steady state oxygen consumption or calculated arteriovenous oxygen difference. It was concluded that children of this age level adapt readily to cardiovascular stress. It was suggested that if improvement in cardiovascular fitness is considered to be a valid goal of physical education, then the traditional sports and games should be supplemented by training procedures designed specifically for endurance.",0
29477501,"Evaluation of ventricular repolarization features with Tp-e, Tp-e/QTc, JTc and JTd during electroconvulsive therapy","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of electrical stimulation transmitted through the body during electroconvulsive therapy on traditional and relatively new ventricular repolarization parameters (Rate corrected QT interval (QTc), QT dispersion (QTd), rate corrected JT interval (JTc), JT dispersion (JTd), T-peak to T-end interval (Tp-e) and Tp-e/QTc ratio) under propofol anaesthesia. METHODS: Twenty-two patients (aged 18-50years) who were each scheduled for ECT for major depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia enrolled to the study. Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings were obtained before anaesthesia and within 3-5min after electrical stimulus of ECT for measurements. QTc, QTd, JTc, JTd, Tp-e and Tp-e/QTc were measured as repolarization indices. RESULTS: The study included twenty-two patients, 9(40.9%) females and 13(59.1%) males, and the mean age accounted for 33.57+/-9.95years. The comparison of the measured parameters before and after ECT, which were not statistically different, were as follows: QTc (416.52+/-46.64 vs 430.00+/-34.00msn; p=0.18), JTc (308.09+/- 25.09 vs 315.47+/-26.89msn; p=0.30), QTd (22.27+/-11.51 vs 20.45+/-9.9msn; p=0.52) and JTd (22.72+/-11.2 vs 17.72+/-10.20msn; p=0.06). Also, no significant difference was detected at the following parameters Tp-e (80.0+/-13.45 vs 78.63+/-15.21msn; p=0.65) and Tp-e/QTc ratio (0.19+/-0.03 vs 0.18+/-0.07; p=0.08). On the other hand, HR showed a significant increase after ECT at 88.13+/-13.74 vs 93.0+/-15.2bpm; p=0.03. CONCLUSION: QTc, QTd, JTc, JTd, Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QTc ratio, which are thought to be potential repolarisation markers for ventricular arrhythmias, did not demonstrate significant change within 3-5min of electrical stimulation during ECT.",0
16405750,Correlation of Skp2 expression in gastric carcinoma to expression of P27 and PTEN,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) is a positive regulator of G1-S transition and promotes ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P27. Its overexpression has been involved in cell transformation and tumorigenesis. This study was to investigate the significance of Skp2 expression in human gastric carcinoma and its correlation to expression of both P27 and PTEN. METHODS: The expression of Skp2 in 138 specimens of gastric cancer and their paired adjacent mucosa, 102 specimens of paired metastatic lymph nodes, 30 specimens of dysplasia, 30 specimens of intestinal metaplasia, 10 specimens of chronic superficial gastritis, and 5 specimens of normal gastric mucosa, and the expression of P27 and PTEN in 138 specimens of gastric cancer were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Skp2 labeling frequency was significantly higher in intestinal metaplasia [(12.68+/-0.86)%] and adjacent mucosa [(19.32+/-1.22)%] than in chronic superficial gastritis [(0.53+/-0.13)%] and normal gastric mucosa [(0.47+/-0.19)%] (P<0.001), but there was no difference between chronic superficial gastritis and normal gastric mucosa (P>0.05); Skp2 labeling frequency was significantly higher in dysplasia [(16.74+/-0.82)%] than in intestinal metaplasia (P<0.001), significantly higher in primary gastric carcinoma [(31.34+/-2.17)%] than in dysplasia and adjacent mucosa (P<0.001), and significantly higher in metastatic lymph node [(39.76+/-2.00)%] than in primary gastric carcinoma (P=0.037). Skp2 labeling frequency in gastric carcinoma was positively correlated with differentiation grade (rs=0.315, P<0.001), vessel invasion (rs=0.303, P<0.001), and lymph node metastasis (rs=0.254, P=0.001). Skp2 expression was negatively correlated with both P27 expression (rs=-0.451, P<0.001) and PTEN expression (rs=-0.480, P<0.001) in gastric carcinoma. P27 expression was positively correlated with PTEN expression in gastric carcinoma (rs=0.642, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Skp2 overexpression, which may lead to degradation of P27 and low expression of PTEN, may be a very important reason in carcinogenesis and progression of gastric carcinoma.",0
29267650,Micronuclei and nuclear anomalies in Mexico's indigenous population,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the number of micronuclei and nuclear anomalies in Mexico's indigenous population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty indigenous individuals were evaluated, including thirty from the ethnicities Cora, Huichol, Tarahumara and Tepehuano. The number of micronuclei (MN) and any nuclear abnormality (NA) in oral mucosa cells, including cells with nuclear buds, binucleated cells, cells with karyolysis, karyorrhetic, condensed chromatin and pyknotic cells were determined for each participant. RESULTS: Tepehuano and Tarahumaras showed the greatest damage to DNA. The Tepehuano group presented the highest number of MN and NA, this being a significant difference (p < 0.05) compared with the rest of the studied groups. This group also presented the highest herbicide exposure (46.7%). In relation to the smoking and drinking habits, these were more frequent in the Tarahumara group (33.3 and 50% respectively). CONCLUSION: The ethnic diversity, habits and customs may influence the DNA nuclear integrity in the Amerindian groups.",0
31511692,Cleavage of RIPK1 by caspase-8 is crucial for limiting apoptosis and necroptosis,"The aspartate-specific cysteine protease caspase-8 suppresses necroptotic cell death mediated by RIPK3 and MLKL. Indeed, mice that lack caspase-8 die in a RIPK3- and MLKL-dependent manner during embryogenesis(1-3). In humans, caspase-8 deficiency is associated with immunodeficiency(4) or very early onset inflammatory bowel disease(5). The substrates that are cleaved by caspase-8 to prevent necroptosis in vivo have not been defined. Here we show that knock-in mice that express catalytically inactive caspase-8(C362A) die as embryos owing to MLKL-dependent necroptosis, similar to caspase-8-deficient mice. Thus, caspase-8 must cleave itself, other proteins or both to inhibit necroptosis. Mice that express caspase-8(D212A/D218A/D225A/D387A), which cannot cleave itself, were viable, as were mice that express c-FLIP or CYLD proteins that had been mutated to prevent cleavage by caspase-8. By contrast, mice that express RIPK1(D325A), in which the caspase-8 cleavage site Asp325 had been mutated, died mid-gestation. Embryonic lethality was prevented by inactivation of RIPK1, loss of TNFR1, or loss of both MLKL and the caspase-8 adaptor FADD, but not by loss of MLKL alone. Thus, RIPK1(D325A) appears to trigger cell death mediated by TNF, the kinase activity of RIPK1 and FADD-caspase-8. Accordingly, dying endothelial cells that contain cleaved caspase-3 were abnormally abundant in yolk sacs of Ripk1(D325A/D325A) embryos. Heterozygous Ripk1(D325A/+) cells and mice were viable, but were also more susceptible to TNF-induced cell death than were wild-type cells or mice. Our data show that Asp325 of RIPK1 is essential for limiting aberrant cell death in response to TNF, consistent with the idea that cleavage of RIPK1 by caspase-8 is a mechanism for dismantling death-inducing complexes.",1
6095282,Nucleotide sequence of cDNA and derived amino acid sequence of human complement component C9,"The nucleotide sequence coding for the ninth component of human complement (C9) has been determined and the corresponding amino acid sequence has been derived. A human liver cDNA library was screened by the colony-hybridization technique using two radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes that correspond to known regions of the C9 amino acid sequence. Two recombinant plasmids were isolated and their cDNA inserts were sequenced. The derived protein sequence consists of 537 amino acids in a single polypeptide chain. A profile of the hydropathic index versus sequence number indicates that the amino-terminal half of C9 is predominantly hydrophilic in character whereas the carboxyl-terminal section of this protein is more hydrophobic. The amphipathic organization of the primary structure of C9 is consistent with the known potential of polymerized C9 to penetrate lipid bilayers, causing the formation of transmembrane channels.",1
2994638,"Metabolism of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate in rat parotid glands","A complete separation of myo-inositol 1,4,5-[4,5-(32)P]trisphosphate prepared from human erythrocytes, and myo-[2-3H]inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate prepared from carbachol-stimulated rat parotid glands [Irvine, Letcher, Lander & Downes (1984) Biochem. J. 223, 237-243], was achieved by anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography. This separation technique was then used to study the metabolism of these two isomers of inositol trisphosphate in carbachol-stimulated rat parotid glands. Fragments of glands were pre-labelled with myo-[2-3H]inositol, washed, and then stimulated with carbachol. At 5s after stimulation a clear increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was detected, with no significant increase in inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. After this initial lag however, inositol 1,3,4-phosphate rose rapidly; by 15s it predominated over inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and continued to rise so that after 15 min it was at 10-20 times the radiolabelling level of the 1,4,5-isomer. In contrast, after the initial rapid rise (maximal within 15s), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels declined to near control levels after 1 min and then rose again very gradually over the next 15 min. When a muscarinic blocker (atropine) was added after 15 min of carbachol stimulation, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels dropped to control levels within 2-3 min, whereas inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate levels took at least 15 min to fall, consistent with the kinetics observed earlier for total parotid inositol trisphosphates [Downes & Wusteman (1983) Biochem. J. 216, 633-640]. Phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) from stimulated and control cells were degraded chemically to inositol trisphosphate to seek evidence for 3H-labelled PtdIns(3,4)P2. No evidence could be obtained that a significant proportion of PtdInsP2 was this isomer; in control tissues it must be less than 5% of the total PtdInsP2 radiolabelled by myo-[2-3H]inositol. These data indicate that, provided that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is studied independently of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, the former shows metabolic characteristics consistent with its proposed role as a second messenger for calcium mobilization. The metabolic profile of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate is entirely different, and its function and source remain unclear.",0
1427864,The gene for the cell adhesion molecule M-cadherin maps to mouse chromosome 8 and human chromosome 16q24.1-qter and is near the E-cadherin (uvomorulin) locus in both species,A mouse myotube-derived cDNA encoding the Ca(2+)-dependent cell adhesion molecule M-cadherin was used to study the segregation of the corresponding gene Cdh3 in a mouse interspecific backcross. Cdh3 was found to be unlinked to the N-cadherin gene but linked to the E-cadherin (uvomorulin) locus on chromosome 8 in a region of conserved synteny with human chromosome 16q. The gene order cen-Junb-Um-Tat-(Cdh3/Aprt) was determined. The human homologue CDH3 was mapped to chromosome 16q24.1-qter by analyzing human/mouse somatic cell hybrids.,1
17959834,LARG and mDia1 link Galpha12/13 to cell polarity and microtubule dynamics,"Regulation of cell polarity is a process observed in all cells. During directed migration, cells orientate their microtubule cytoskeleton and the microtubule-organizing-center (MTOC), which involves integrins and downstream Cdc42 and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta activity. However, the contribution of G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction for MTOC polarity is less well understood. Here, we report that the heterotrimeric Galpha(12) and Galpha(13) proteins are necessary for MTOC polarity and microtubule dynamics based on studies using Galpha(12/13)-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Cell polarization involves the Galpha(12/13)-interacting leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) and the actin-nucleating diaphanous formin mDia1. Interestingly, LARG associates with pericentrin and localizes to the MTOC and along microtubule tracks. We propose that Galpha(12/13) proteins exert essential functions linking extracellular signals to microtubule dynamics and cell polarity via RhoGEF and formin activity.",1
8074759,Historical background of changes in FDA policy on the study and evaluation of drugs in women,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently made two important changes in its policy for the study and evaluation of drugs in women: (1) sex-specific analyses of the safety and efficacy of drugs will be required as part of all new drug applications, and (2) it will no longer be recommended that women of childbearing potential be restricted from participating in the earliest phases of drug trials. These changes have come about as a result of continuous efforts to individualize therapy, to improve upon the safety and efficacy of drugs, and to respond to important questions about whether the drug development process produces adequate information about the effects of drugs in women. In turn, these efforts are the outgrowth of a long history in the United States of changes in the clinical care for women, changes in the use of women as research subjects, changing attitudes about the balance between protection and risks for women in clinical trials, and national movements by women to focus on issues of their health care and to transform the male-oriented model of clinical research. The new FDA guidelines, published in July 1993, will provide guidance to researchers on accumulating valuable information on how drugs work in women and will help make it possible for physicians and other caregivers to consider the effects of gender on health and treatment.",0

32062960,Chronic Constipation in the Elderly Patient: Updates in Evaluation and Management,"Chronic constipation (CC) is a common disorder in the elderly population globally and is associated with comorbidities and negative implications on the quality of life. Constipation prevalence varies in different studies, primarily owing to the nonuniformity of the diagnostic criteria. However, 15%-30% of individuals aged >60 years are diagnosed with CC. Primary care physicians are the main healthcare providers that manage constipation in elderly patients in parallel with increased population aging and increased prevalence of constipation. Physical inactivity, polypharmacy, chronic medical conditions, rectal hyposensitivity, and defecatory disorders all play a role in the pathogenesis of CC in elderly patients. Detailed anamnesis, particularly history related to chronic medication use, with digital rectal examination may assist in identifying constipation causes. Additionally, blood tests and colonoscopy may identify organic causes of CC. Physiologic tests (i.e., anorectal manometry, colonic transit time with radiopaque markers, and defecography) can evaluate the physiologic function of the colon, rectum, and anus. However, generally, there are several causes of constipation in older patients, and an individualized approach is recommended. Treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation is empiric, based on the stepwise approach. Lifestyle advice, adjustment of chronic medications, and prescription of laxatives are the first steps of management. Several laxatives are available, and the treatment is evolving in the last decade. Biofeedback is an effective therapy especially for defecatory disorders. This review aimed to summarize the most updated knowledge for primary care physicians in the approach and management of CC in elderly patients.",0

15260986,Tie2/angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche,"The quiescent state is thought to be an indispensable property for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Interaction of HSCs with their particular microenvironments, known as the stem cell niches, is critical for adult hematopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM). Here, we demonstrate that HSCs expressing the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 are quiescent and antiapoptotic, and comprise a side-population (SP) of HSCs, which adhere to osteoblasts (OBs) in the BM niche. The interaction of Tie2 with its ligand Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) induced cobblestone formation of HSCs in vitro and maintained in vivo long-term repopulating activity of HSCs. Furthermore, Ang-1 enhanced the ability of HSCs to become quiescent and induced adhesion to bone, resulting in protection of the HSC compartment from myelosuppressive stress. These data suggest that the Tie2/Ang-1 signaling pathway plays a critical role in the maintenance of HSCs in a quiescent state in the BM niche.",1
6699177,Peripheral tissue mechanism for maintenance of serum triiodothyronine values in a thyroxine-deficient state in man,"The present study was undertaken to define the source of endogenous triiodothyronine (T3) production responsible for maintaining serum T3 levels in euthyroid subjects with depressed serum thyroxine (T4) values. After withdrawal from 4 wk of exogenous T3 administration, a 22% decline in serum T3 values (from 129 +/- 6 to 99 +/- 4 ng/dl) was observed in six euthyroid subjects, despite a twofold reduction in serum T4 concentrations (from 7.5 +/- 0.5 to 3.2 +/- 0.5 micrograms/dl). This was accompanied by a nearly twofold increase in serum T3/T4 ratio values (17 +/- 1 to 29 +/- 6) but no significant alteration in reverse T3/T4 ratio values. This phenomenon did not appear to be thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) dependent, since base-line serum TSH values were subnormal. Nor was it dependent on changes in thyroid gland function, since a blunted T3 response to exogenous bovine TSH occurred and pharmacologic doses of iodide did not influence the phenomenon. The finding in three athyreotic subjects that serum T3/T4 ratio values increased from 14 +/- 1 on T4 therapy (mean serum T4, 9.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dl and T3, 132 +/- 8 ng/dl) to 40 +/- 2 after withdrawal from 2 wk of T3 administration (serum T4 1.2 +/- 0.1 micrograms/dl and T3 46 +/- 3 ng/dl) provided direct evidence that an alteration in peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism was probably responsible for these findings previously observed in euthyroid subjects. The results of this study support the possible existence in euthyroid man of a peripheral tissue autoregulatory mechanism for maintaining serum T3 values in states of T4 deficiency. Whether this process involves an alteration in the efficiency of T4 to T3 conversion or the rate of T3 clearance is presently unknown.",0
11030331,Molecular basis for feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis by nuclear receptors,"The catabolism of cholesterol into bile acids is regulated by oxysterols and bile acids, which induce or repress transcription of the pathway's rate-limiting enzyme cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). The nuclear receptor LXRalpha binds oxysterols and mediates feed-forward induction. Here, we show that repression is coordinately regulated by a triumvirate of nuclear receptors, including the bile acid receptor, FXR; the promoter-specific activator, LRH-1; and the promoter-specific repressor, SHP. Feedback repression of CYP7A1 is accomplished by the binding of bile acids to FXR, which leads to transcription of SHP. Elevated SHP protein then inactivates LRH-1 by forming a heterodimeric complex that leads to promoter-specific repression of both CYP7A1 and SHP. These results reveal an elaborate autoregulatory cascade mediated by nuclear receptors for the maintenance of hepatic cholesterol catabolism.",1

Detailed calculations of photomeson neutrino production are presented for the collapsar model, where internal nonthermal synchrotron radiation is the primary target photon field, and the supranova model, where external pulsar-wind synchrotron radiation provides important additional target photons. Detection of greater, similar 10 TeV neutrinos from GRBs with Doppler factors > or approximately 200, inferred from gamma-ray observations, would support the supranova model. Detection of < or approximately 10 TeV neutrinos is possible for neutrinos formed from nuclear production. Only the most powerful bursts at fluence levels > or approximately 3 x 10(-4) erg cm(-2) offer a realistic prospect for detection of nu(mu).",0
31919982,The Dynamic Nature of CO Adlayers on Pt(111) Electrodes,"CO adlayers on Pt(111) electrode surfaces are an important electrochemical system and of great relevance to electrocatalysis. The potential-dependent structure and dynamics of these adlayers are complex and still controversial, especially in the CO pre-oxidation regime. We here employ in situ high-speed scanning tunneling microscopy for studying the surface phase behavior in CO-saturated 0.1 m H2 SO4 on the millisecond time scale. At potentials near the onset of CO pre-oxidation local fluctuations in the (2x2)-CO adlayer are observed, which increase towards more positive potentials. Above 0.20 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), this leads to an adlayer where COad apparently reside on every top site, but still exhibit a (2x2) superstructure modulation. We interpret this observation as a dynamic effect, caused by a small number of highly mobile point defects in the (2x2)-CO adlayer. As shown by density functional theory calculations, the CO lattice near such defects relaxes into a local (1x1) arrangement, which can rapidly propagate across the surface. This scenario, where a static (2x2) COad sublattice coexists with a highly dynamic sublattice of partially occupied top sites, explains the pronounced COad surface mobility during electrooxidation.",0
11268215,Effects of chronic exposure to cocaine are regulated by the neuronal protein Cdk5,"Cocaine enhances dopamine-mediated neurotransmission by blocking dopamine re-uptake at axon terminals. Most dopamine-containing nerve terminals innervate medium spiny neurons in the striatum of the brain. Cocaine addiction is thought to stem, in part, from neural adaptations that act to maintain equilibrium by countering the effects of repeated drug administration. Chronic exposure to cocaine upregulates several transcription factors that alter gene expression and which could mediate such compensatory neural and behavioural changes. One such transcription factor is DeltaFosB, a protein that persists in striatum long after the end of cocaine exposure. Here we identify cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) as a downstream target gene of DeltaFosB by use of DNA array analysis of striatal material from inducible transgenic mice. Overexpression of DeltaFosB, or chronic cocaine administration, raised levels of Cdk5 messenger RNA, protein, and activity in the striatum. Moreover, injection of Cdk5 inhibitors into the striatum potentiated behavioural effects of repeated cocaine administration. Our results suggest that changes in Cdk5 levels mediated by DeltaFosB, and resulting alterations in signalling involving D1 dopamine receptors, contribute to adaptive changes in the brain related to cocaine addiction.",1
10861024,T-type alpha 1H Ca2+ channels are involved in Ca2+ signaling during terminal differentiation (fusion) of human myoblasts,"Mechanisms underlying Ca(2+) signaling during human myoblast terminal differentiation were studied using cell cultures. We found that T-type Ca(2+) channels (T-channels) are expressed in myoblasts just before fusion. Their inhibition by amiloride or Ni(2+) suppresses fusion and prevents an intracellular Ca(2+) concentration increase normally observed at the onset of fusion. The use of antisense oligonucleotides indicates that the functional T-channels are formed by alpha1H subunits. At hyperpolarized potentials, these channels allow a window current sufficient to increase [Ca(2+)](i). As hyperpolarization is a prerequisite to myoblast fusion, we conclude that the Ca(2+) signal required for fusion is produced when the resting potential enters the T-channel window. A similar mechanism could operate in other cell types of which differentiation implicates membrane hyperpolarization.",1
7859845,The HIV prevalence among pregnant women in the Amsterdam region (1988-1991),"The objective of the study was to monitor the HIV prevalence in the years 1988-1991 among pregnant women in the Amsterdam region, visitors to an abortion clinic and 3 outpatient infertility clinics. All women attending these clinics were asked to participate in the study on a voluntary basis and were tested with informed consent. The women were questioned about risk-bearing behaviour of themselves and their sexual partner(s). In the period 1988-1991, of the 23,827 eligible pregnant women, 22,165 women participated (93.0%). Twenty-seven women were found to be positive for HIV antibodies (0.12%, 95% CI: 0.08%-0.17%), of whom twenty belonged to a known HIV risk group or had a partner who belonged to one of these groups and 7 women had no known HIV risk. Seventeen of the 27 women had a foreign nationality. The annual HIV prevalence among pregnant women was: 1988: 0.28%; 1989: 0.10%; 1990: 0.10%; 1991: 0.11%. In the years 1990 and 1991, of the 1,128 eligible women visiting the abortion clinic 953 (84.5%) were tested. Eleven women were HIV-seropositive (1.15%, 95% CI: 0.6%-2.0%), of whom 9 were from an AIDS endemic region, 1 woman had a partner from this region and 1 woman had no known HIV risk. Four African women had HIV-2 antibodies. At the 3 outpatient infertility clinics 1 woman was found to be HIV-positive (0.13%; 95% CI: 0.02-0.9). She had no other risk than a partner from an AIDS endemic area. In the Amsterdam region there was a steady and low HIV prevalence (0.1%) among pregnant women through the years 1988-1991. The prevalence in the abortion clinic was ten times higher. The program was able to detect possible high risk groups within the population. Migration and travelling can play an important role in the spread of HIV in the general heterosexual population.",0
28945605,Robust Stabilization of T-S Fuzzy Stochastic Descriptor Systems via Integral Sliding Modes,This paper addresses the robust stabilization problem for T-S fuzzy stochastic descriptor systems using an integral sliding mode control paradigm. A classical integral sliding mode control scheme and a nonparallel distributed compensation (Non-PDC) integral sliding mode control scheme are presented. It is shown that two restrictive assumptions previously adopted developing sliding mode controllers for Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy stochastic systems are not required with the proposed framework. A unified framework for sliding mode control of T-S fuzzy systems is formulated. The proposed Non-PDC integral sliding mode control scheme encompasses existing schemes when the previously imposed assumptions hold. Stability of the sliding motion is analyzed and the sliding mode controller is parameterized in terms of the solutions of a set of linear matrix inequalities which facilitates design. The methodology is applied to an inverted pendulum model to validate the effectiveness of the results presented.,0
20495567,A genome-wide RNA interference screen reveals an essential CREB3L2-ATF5-MCL1 survival pathway in malignant glioma with therapeutic implications,"Activating transcription factor-5 (ATF5) is highly expressed in malignant glioma and has a key role in promoting cell survival. Here we perform a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify transcriptional regulators of ATF5. Our results reveal an essential survival pathway in malignant glioma, whereby activation of a RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase or phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling cascade leads to induction of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein-3-like-2 (CREB3L2), which directly activates ATF5 expression. ATF5, in turn, promotes survival by stimulating transcription of myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (MCL1), an antiapoptotic B cell leukemia-2 family member. Analysis of human malignant glioma samples indicates that ATF5 expression inversely correlates with disease prognosis. The RAF kinase inhibitor sorafenib suppresses ATF5 expression in glioma stem cells and inhibits malignant glioma growth in cell culture and mouse models. Our results demonstrate that ATF5 is essential in malignant glioma genesis and reveal that the ATF5-mediated survival pathway described here provides potential therapeutic targets for treatment of malignant glioma.",1
2599379,New gene arrangements in natural populations of Drosophila subobscura,"Four new gene arrangements were detected in natural populations of Drosophila subobscura near Zurich, Switzerland. Three of them are the result of inversions not recorded before, and one is a new combination of known gene arrangements. Another arrangement, I3 + 4, was recorded for the first time in Switzerland. It may have been imported or possibly may have arisen de novo. It is suggested that inversion mutations are not so infrequent as so far supposed, if the presence of mobile elements is taken into account in D. subobscura.",0
12897788,Adenylyl cyclase I regulates AMPA receptor trafficking during mouse cortical 'barrel' map development,"Cortical map formation requires the accurate targeting, synaptogenesis, elaboration and refinement of thalamocortical afferents. Here we demonstrate the role of Ca2+/calmodulin-activated type-I adenylyl cyclase (AC1) in regulating the strength of thalamocortical synapses through modulation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking using barrelless mice, a mutant without AC1 activity or cortical 'barrel' maps. Barrelless synapses are stuck in an immature state that contains few functional AMPARs that are rarely silent (NMDAR-only). Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) at thalamocortical synapses require postsynaptic protein kinase A (PKA) activity and are difficult to induce in barrelless mice, probably due to an inability to properly regulate synaptic AMPAR trafficking. Consistent with this, both the extent of PKA phosphorylation on AMPAR subunit GluR1 and the expression of surface GluR1 are reduced in barrelless neurons. These results suggest that activity-dependent mechanisms operate through an AC1/PKA signaling pathway to target some synapses for consolidation and others for elimination during barrel map formation.",1
3500184,Expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-2-Ig fusion transcripts in normal and neoplastic cells,"We examined the expression of the Bcl-2 gene at chromosome segment 18q21, that is translocated into the Ig heavy chain gene locus in t(14;18) bearing lymphomas. Bcl-2, while B cell associated, is expressed in a variety of hematopoietic lineages including T cells. Bcl-2 mRNA levels are high during pre-B cell development, the time at which the t(14;18) translocation occurs, but are down regulated with maturation. Like certain other oncogenes, Bcl-2 is quiescent in resting B cells but up-regulated with B cell activation. Mature B cell lymphomas with a t(14;18) have log-folds more mRNA than matched counterparts without the translocation. A sensitive S1 protection assay revealed that all transcripts in t(14;18) B cells were Bcl-2-Ig fusion mRNAs and originated from the translocated allele. Thus, there is a marked deregulation of Bcl-2 when it is introduced into the Ig locus in t(14;18) lymphomas.",1
10619865,Lung fluid transport in aquaporin-5 knockout mice,"The mammalian lung expresses water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1) in microvascular endothelia, AQP4 in airway epithelia, and AQP5 at the apical plasma membrane in type I cells of alveolar epithelia. We previously studied the role of AQP1 and AQP4 in lung fluid transport using knockout mice. Here, we examined the role of AQP5 using AQP5 knockout mice, which were recently shown to manifest defective saliva secretion. AQP5 deletion did not affect lung morphology at the light microscopic level, nor did it affect the distribution or expression of aquaporins 1, 3, or 4. Airspace-capillary osmotic water permeability (P(f)) was measured in isolated perfused lungs by pleural surface fluorescence and gravimetric methods. P(f) was reduced 10-fold by AQP5 deletion and was further reduced by 2- to 3-fold in AQP1/AQP5 double-knockout mice. Hydrostatic lung edema in response to acute increases in pulmonary artery pressure was not affected by AQP5 deletion. Active alveolar fluid absorption was measured in an in situ lung model from the increase in concentration of a volume marker in an isosmolar alveolar instillate. Interestingly, fluid absorption did not differ in litter-matched AQP5 knockout mice, nor was there an effect of AQP5 deletion when fluid absorption was maximally stimulated by pretreatment of mice with keratinocyte growth factor. These results indicate that AQP5 is responsible for the majority of water transport across the apical membrane of type I alveolar epithelial cells. The unimpaired alveolar fluid clearance in AQP5-null mice indicates that high alveolar water permeability is not required for active, near-isosmolar fluid transport.",1
15903613,Parametric light bullets supported by quasi-phase-matched quadratically nonlinear crystals,"We present a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of three-dimensional spatiotemporal nonspinning and spinning solitons in quasi-phased-matched (QPM) gratings. By employing an averaging approach based on perturbation theory, we show that the soliton's stability is strongly affected by the QPM-induced third-order nonlinearity (which is always of a mixed type, with opposite signs in front of the corresponding self-phase and cross-phase modulation terms). We study the dependence of the stability of the spatiotemporal soliton (STS) on its energy, spin, the wave-vector mismatch between the fundamental and second harmonics, and the relative strength of the intrinsic quadratic and QPM-induced cubic nonlinearities. In particular, all the spinning solitons are unstable against fragmentation, while zero-spin STS's have their stability regions on the system's parameter space.",0

30143500,CYP3A4*1B Polymorphism and Cancer Risk: A Meta-Analysis Based on 55 Case-control Studies,"Published data on the association between CYP3A4*1B polymorphism and cancer risk are inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the association, we conducted a meta-analysis. A systematic search of the PubMed database was performed. A total of 55 separate studies including 22072 cancer cases and 25433 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. We found a significant association between CYP3A4*1B and cancer risk in the overall population in dominant model (AG+GG vs. AA: OR=1.142, 95% CI=1.006-1.295). No significant association was found in recessive model (GG vs. AG+AA: OR=1.156, 95% CI=0.941-1.419), heterozygous model (AG vs. AA: OR=1.109, 95% CI=0.977-1.259), or homozygous model (GG vs. AA: OR=1.213, 95% CI=0.950-1.549). We performed subgroup meta-analysis based on the difference of ethnicity and cancer type. Ethnic subgroup analyses revealed no significant associations of African or Caucasian ethnicities in any genetic models. In the subgroup analysis by Cancer types, we observed an increased risk for leukemia in dominant model and heterozygous model. Excluding studies with controls not in HWE, a significant association was found in dominant model and heterozygous model. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that the CYP3A4*1B polymorphism might play a modest role in susceptibility to cancer, especially for leukemia.",0

Polished spicules had specific concentric patterns that varied depending on the plane in which the spicules were sectioned. A 3D model of the concentric layers was created to interpret these patterns and the biomineralization process of the triactine spicules. The morphology of the spicules was compared with the crystallographic orientation of the calcite crystals by analyzing the Kikuchi diffraction patterns using a scanning electron microscope. Triactine spicules from the subclass Calcinea had actines (rays) elongated in the <210> direction, which is perpendicular to the c-axis. The scale spicules of the hypercalcified species Murrayona phanolepis presented the c-axis perpendicular to the plane of the scale, which is in accordance with the crystallography of all other Calcinea. The triactine spicules of the calcaronean species had approximately the same crystallographic orientation with the unpaired actine elongated in the  approximately [211] direction. Only one Calcaronea species, whose triactine was regular, had a different orientation. Three different crystallographic orientations were found in diactines. Spicules with different morphologies, dimensions and positions in the sponge body had similar crystallographic directions suggesting that the crystallographic orientation of spicules in calcareous sponges is conserved through evolution.",0
18711127,Loss of AKAP150 perturbs distinct neuronal processes in mice,"A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs) ensure the fidelity of second messenger signaling events by directing protein kinases and phosphatases toward their preferred substrates. AKAP150 brings protein kinase A (PKA), the calcium/calmodulin dependent phosphatase PP2B and protein kinase C (PKC) to postsynaptic membranes where they facilitate the phosphorylation dependent modulation of certain ion channels. Immunofluorescence and electrophysiological recordings were combined with behavioral analyses to assess whether removal of AKAP150 by gene targeting in mice changes the signaling environment to affect excitatory and inhibitory neuronal processes. Mislocalization of PKA in AKAP150 null hippocampal neurons alters the bidirectional modulation of postsynaptic AMPA receptors with concomitant changes in synaptic transmission and memory retention. AKAP150 null mice also exhibit deficits in motor coordination and strength that are consistent with a role for the anchoring protein in the cerebellum. Loss of AKAP150 in sympathetic cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons reduces muscarinic suppression of inhibitory M currents and provides these animals with a measure of resistance to seizures induced by the non-selective muscarinic agonist pilocarpine. These studies argue that distinct AKAP150-enzyme complexes regulate context-dependent neuronal signaling events in vivo.",1
9681121,Force in women's sexual fantasies,"Attitudinal and experiential correlates of sexual fantasies involving force or coercion against the fantasizer were studied in 137 college women. Results revealed that (i) virtually every woman reported engaging in sexual fantasy on a regular basis, (ii) more than half the subjects reported having engaged in a force fantasy, (iii) those reporting force fantasies scored as less sexually guilty and more erotophilic than those not reporting such fantasies. Those reporting force fantasies also had more sexual experience and engaged in more fantasizing of the nonforce type than the other subjects. A history of exposure to sexual force or coercion was unrelated to the report of force fantasies. Taken together, these findings are offered in support of the hypothesis that the occurrence of force fantasies, rather than resulting from an attempt to deal with sexual guilt, represents one of a number of ways in which some women demonstrate a relatively open, unrestricted, and varied approach to their sexuality.",0
2862934,Pharmacological characterization of alpha-adrenergic receptor subtypes mediating contraction in human mesenteric arteries and veins,"Approximately 200 isolated human mesenteric arteries (diameter less than 1 mm) and veins (diameter less than 2 mm) were tested in vitro for their contractile and dilator responses to adrenergic agonists under standardized conditions. This allowed for quantitative estimation of various receptor characteristics: relative agonist potency; concentration for half maximum response (EC50); amount of maximum response (EAm), and affinity of antagonist to receptor (KB and pA2). The contractile response of the vessels to the various sympathomimetic amines involved alpha-adrenoceptors. Postjunctionally, the alpha 1 type of receptor predominated in the arteries whereas the alpha 2-receptor subtype was mainly found in the veins. None of the amines produced any vasodilatory effects in the vessels tested after previous contraction with prostaglandin F2 alpha.",0
15657147,Human maintenance DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase and p53 modulate expression of p53-repressed promoters,"DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 participates in transcriptional repression of genes by methylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Here, DNMT1 is shown to bind p53 and colocalize in the nucleus. DNMT1-mediated methylation is stimulated by p53 in vitro. Upon p53 induction, a reporter construct containing the antiapoptotic gene survivin promoter, which contains a natural p53 binding site, was methylated in WT HCT116 cells but not in DNMT1 null or p53 null cells. Endogenous survivin gene repression involves cooperation between DNMT1 and p53 and is relieved by introduction of DNMT1- or p53-specific small inhibitory RNA. DNMT1 null cells did not exhibit a significant repressive effect for p53 responsive survivin and cdc25C gene expression compared with the parental cells. Normal human fibroblasts also exhibited similar DNMT1- and p53-mediated methylation of the survivin promoter, suggesting cooperation between p53 and DNMT1 in gene silencing.",1

The resulting somatic mosaicism can be an important molecular determinant of in vivo androgen action caused by expression of the wild-type androgen receptor (AR). However, the clinical relevance of this previously underestimated genetic condition in androgen insensitivity syndrome has not been investigated in detail as yet. Here, we present the clinical and molecular spectrum of somatic mosaicism considering all five patients with mosaic androgen insensitivity syndrome, whom we have identified since 1993: Patient 1 (predominantly female, clitoromegaly), 172 TTA(Leu)/TGA(Stop); patient 2 (ambiguous), 596 GCC(Ala)/ACC(Thr); patient 3 (ambiguous), 733 CAG(Gln)/ CAT(His); patient 4 (completely female), 774 CGC(Arg)/TGC (Cys); and patient 5 (ambiguous), 866 GTG(Val)/ATG(Met). Serum sex hormone binding globulin response to stanozolol, usually correlating well with in vivo AR function, was inconclusive for assessment of the phenotypes in all tested mosaic individuals. An unexpectedly strong virilization occurred in patients 1, 3, and 5 compared with phenotypes as published with corresponding inherited mutations and compared with the markedly impaired transactivation caused by the mutant ARs in cotransfection experiments. Only the prepubertal virilization of patients 2 and 4 matched appropriately with transactivation studies (patient 4) or the literature (patients 2 and 4). However, partial pubertal virilization in patient 4 caused by increasing serum androgens and subsequent activation of the wild-type AR could not be excluded. We conclude that somatic mosaicism is of particular clinical relevance in androgen insensitivity syndrome. The possibility of functionally relevant expression of the wild-type AR needs to be considered in all mosaic individuals, and treatment should be adjusted accordingly.",1

15744523,A neutral variant involved in a complex CFTR allele contributes to a severe cystic fibrosis phenotype,"In order to further elucidate the contribution of complex alleles to the wide phenotypic variability of cystic fibrosis (CF), we investigated the structure-function relationships of a severe CF-associated complex allele [p.S912L;p.G1244V]. To evaluate the contribution of each mutation to the phenotype, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutants were expressed in HeLa cells and analysed for protein processing and Cl- channel activity. Both p.G1244V and [p.S912L;p.G1244V] mutants had normal protein processing but markedly decreased Cl- channel activity compared with wild-type. Notably, the double mutant displayed a dramatic decrease in Cl- channel activity compared with p.G1244V (P<0.001). p.S912L had normal protein processing and no detectable impact on CFTR function. In other respects, the p.S912L variation was identified in compound heterozygosity with p.R709X in a healthy fertile man. Together, these data strongly support the view that p.S912L in isolation should be considered as a neutral variant but one that might significantly impair CFTR function when inherited in cis with another CFTR mutation. Our data also further document the contribution of complex alleles to the wide phenotypic variability of CF. The results of functional studies of such complex alleles in other genetic diseases are discussed.",1

2706105,Autosomal recessive nonsyndromal profound childhood deafness in a large pedigree. Audiometric features of the affected persons and the obligate carriers,"Nonsyndromal autosomal recessive profound childhood deafness will affect about one in 4000 children in western Europe. A nonsyndromal autosomal recessive type of profound childhood deafness was thought to be the cause of deafness in at least eight and probably 12 children from a large family with various consanguineous matings and other family interrelations. Audiograms of all affected deaf children showed a profound childhood deafness with only a very slight variation. Audiometric examinations, such as pure-tone audiometry, high-frequency audiometry, stapedial reflexes, and Bekesy audiometry, of ten obligate or presumed carriers did not show any significant findings that would allow identification of carriers of this autosomal recessive gene. Families like this one seem to be very rare. Large clinically well-studied families like this one are indispensable for gene linkage studies of nonsyndromal autosomal recessive types of profound childhood deafness. Such studies should make it possible to trace the origin of these types of childhood deafness at an early age. In consequence, carrier detection should also become available.",1
12132528,Visceral larva migrans due to Ascaris suum which presented with eosinophilic pneumonia and multiple intra-hepatic lesions with severe eosinophil infiltration--outbreak in a Japanese area other than Kyushu,"A 32-year-old man presented with the chief complaint of severe cough. Examination of peripheral blood showed a marked increase in eosinophils. Chest CT demonstrated multiple ground glass opacities in both lungs. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed abundant eosinophils. Abdominal CT demonstrated multiple low attenuation areas in the liver. Liver biopsy with ultrasonography revealed severe eosinophil infiltrations around the portal veins. Serologically, a multi-dot enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DOT-ELISA) and ELISA inhibition test using microtiter plates were positive for Ascaris suum. Thus, visceral larva migrans due to Ascaris suum was diagnosed. Outbreaks of this disease in Japan have previously been confined to the Kyushu area. The present case which occurred outside that area, illustrates the importance of constant attention to the epidemiology of this disease.",0
26941952,Anticipated regret in shared decision-making: a randomized experimental study,"BACKGROUND: Explicit consideration of anticipated regret is not part of the standard shared decision-making protocols. This pilot study aimed to compare decisions about a hypothetical surgery for breast cancer and examined whether regret is a consideration in treatment decisions. METHODS: In this randomized experimental study, 184 healthy female volunteers were randomized to receive a standard decision aid (control) or one with information on post-surgical regret (experimental). The main outcome measures were the proportion of subjects choosing lumpectomy vs. mastectomy and the proportion reporting that regret played a role in the decision made. We hypothesized that a greater proportion of the experimental group (regret-incorporated decision aid) would make a surgical treatment preference that favored the less regret-inducing option and that they would be more likely to consider regret in their decision-making process as compared to the control group. RESULTS: A significantly greater proportion of the experimental group subjects reported regret played a role in their decision-making process compared to the control counterparts (78 vs. 65 %; p = 0.039). Recipients of the regret-incorporated experimental decision aid had a threefold increased odds of choosing the less regret-inducing surgery (OR = 2.97; 95 % CI = 1.25, 7.09; p value = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: In this hypothetical context, the incorporation of regret in a decision aid for preference-sensitive surgery impacted decision-making. This finding suggests that keying in on anticipated regret may be an important element of shared decision-making strategies. Our results make a strong argument for applying this design and pursuing further research in a surgical patient population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02563808.",0
27021405,Constitutive Autophagy and Nucleophagy during Epidermal Differentiation,"Epidermal keratinocytes migrate through the epidermis up to the granular layer where, on terminal differentiation, they progressively lose organelles and convert into anucleate cells or corneocytes. Our report explores the role of autophagy in ensuring epidermal function providing the first comprehensive profile of autophagy marker expression in developing epidermis. We show that autophagy is constitutively active in the epidermal granular layer where by electron microscopy we identified double-membrane autophagosomes. We demonstrate that differentiating keratinocytes undergo a selective form of nucleophagy characterized by accumulation of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3/lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2/p62 positive autolysosomes. These perinuclear vesicles displayed positivity for histone interacting protein, heterochromatin protein 1alpha, and localize in proximity with Lamin A and B1 accumulation, whereas in newborn mice and adult human skin, we report LC3 puncta coincident with misshaped nuclei within the granular layer. This process relies on autophagy integrity as confirmed by lack of nucleophagy in differentiating keratinocytes depleted from WD repeat domain phosphoinositide interacting 1 or Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1. Final validation into a skin disease model showed that impaired autophagy contributes to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Lack of LC3 expression in psoriatic skin lesions correlates with parakeratosis and deregulated expression or location of most of the autophagic markers. Our findings may have implications and improve treatment options for patients with epidermal barrier defects.",0
9721705,Photodynamic therapy for palliation of chest wall recurrence in patients with breast cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chest wall recurrence occurs in 5-20% of breast cancer patients. Until recently, the only treatments available were surgical resection or radiotherapy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a new modality that uses a photosensitizer and light to destroy tumor cells selectively. We report here our experience with PDT as a treatment for chest wall recurrence. METHODS: Seven patients with breast cancer who had chest wall recurrence despite previous therapy were treated with PDT. Four patients received one treatment, one received two treatments at the same site, one received two separate treatments at different sites, and one received three separate treatments at distinct sites. Response and adverse events were monitored. RESULTS: The total response rate of 91% (10/11), with complete response (CR) in 73% (8/11) and partial response (PR) in 18% (2/11), was based on total number of treatments. The mean time to lesion healing was 73 days (range <30-99 days). One patient experienced a photosensitivity reaction after exposure to direct sunlight. No other adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: PDT is an effective treatment for chest wall recurrence in patients with breast cancer in whom other treatments have failed. PDT is also well tolerated, especially when compared with traditional therapies.",0
20448485,Curcumin labeling of neuronal fibrillar tau inclusions in human brain samples,"The study aimed to characterize curcumin (CCM) (fluorescent yellow curry pigment) labeling of neuronal fibrillar tau inclusions (FTIs) in representative cases of 3 main tauopathies: Alzheimer disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy, and Pick disease. After identification of FTIs in hematoxylin and eosin-stained brain sections, sequential labeling and signal colocalization image analysis were used to compare CCM with thioflavine S (ThS), monoclonal antibody AT8 immunofluorescence, and Gallyas silver staining by visualizing the same FTIs. Curcumin preference for specific tau isoforms was tested with 3-repeat tau and 4-repeat tau isoform-specific immunofluorescence. Curcumin proved highly comparable to ThS and Gallyas staining in its detection of FTIs. When comparing CCM with AT8, ThS, and Gallyas staining in AD and progressive supranuclear palsy, 3 types of neuronal tau deposits were observed: nonfibrillar intracellular material labeled only with AT8, fibrillar intracellular inclusions labeled by all the methods, and fibrillar extracellular FTIs labeled with CCM, ThS, and Gallyas staining but not with AT8. Although CCM labeling overlapped with both 3-repeat tau and 4-repeat tau in AD, it did not label 3-repeat tau FTIs in Pick disease probably because of their different ultrastructural characteristics. In summary, CCM fluorescence reliably detected neuronal FTIs in AD and progressive supranuclear palsy and surpassed AT8 immunolabeling in visualizing later stages of FTIs, including ghost tangles. These results provide the basis for potential future applications of CCM binding of tau aggregates in diagnostic pathology and in vivo.",0
3536948,Constrictive pericarditis following coronary bypass reoperation. Fibrotic pericardium and a foreign body reaction,"A 65-year-old male patient underwent two bypass operations because of coronary artery disease. After the second operation he developed congestive heart failure with breathlessness, ankle swelling, hepatomegaly and poor exercise tolerance. Echocardiographic and haemodynamic findings were characteristic of constrictive pericarditis. Pericardiectomy was performed three months after the second operation. The retrosternal space was replaced with fibrotic, patchy hyalinic tissue, and the pericardium was thick and rigid. Histologically, the thickened pericardium showed dense fibrosis and foreign-body granulomas with large multinuclear giant cells and irregular crystals. This report indicates that foreign body reaction following coronary artery bypass operation may result in constrictive pericarditis with severe heart failure.",0
9312129,Human factor H deficiency. Mutations in framework cysteine residues and block in H protein secretion and intracellular catabolism,"The synthesis and secretion of factor H, a regulatory protein of the complement system, were studied in skin fibroblasts from an H-deficient child who has chronic hypocomplementemic renal disease. In normal fibroblasts, factor H transcripts of 4.3 and 1.8 kilobase pairs (kb) encode a 155-kDa protein containing short consensus repeat (SCR) domains 1-20 and a 45-kDa protein which contains SCRs 1-7, respectively. The patient's fibroblasts expressed normal amounts of the 4.3- and 1.8-kb messages constitutively and after tumor necrosis factor-alpha/interferon-gamma stimulation. Lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled fibroblasts from the patient contained the 155- and 45-kDa H polypeptides, but secretion of the 155-kDa protein was blocked; the 45-kDa protein was secreted with normal kinetics. The patient's plasma lacked the 155-kDa protein but contained the small form of H. Moreover, in fibroblasts the retained 155-kDa factor H protein was not degraded, even after 12 h. Immunoflourescent staining and confocal microscopic imaging of the patient's fibroblasts indicated that factor H was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Sequence analysis of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products (the entire coding region) and genomic DNA revealed a T1679C substitution on one allele and a G2949A substitution on the other (C518R mutation in SCR 9 and C991Y mutation in SCR 16, respectively). Both mutations affect conserved cysteine residues characteristic of SCR modules and therefore predict profound changes in the higher order structure of the 155-kDa factor H protein. These data provide the first description of a molecular mechanism for factor H deficiency and yield important insights into the normal secretory pathway for this and other plasma proteins with SCR motifs.",1
25421246,Some characteristics of free cell population in the airways of rats after intratracheal instillation of copper-containing nano-scale particles,"We used stable water suspensions of copper oxide particles with mean diameter 20 nm and of particles containing copper oxide and element copper with mean diameter 340 nm to assess the pulmonary phagocytosis response of rats to a single intratracheal instillation of these suspensions using optical, transmission electron, and semi-contact atomic force microscopy and biochemical indices measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Although both nano and submicron ultrafine particles were adversely bioactive, the former were found to be more toxic for lungs as compared with the latter while evoking more pronounced defense recruitment of alveolar macrophages and especially of neutrophil leukocytes and more active phagocytosis. Based on our results and literature data, we consider both copper solubilization and direct contact with cellular organelles (mainly, mitochondria) of persistent particles internalized by phagocytes as probable mechanisms of their cytotoxicity.

24814228,Working time and cigarette smoking: evidence from Australia and the United Kingdom,"Cigarette smoking is a risk factor in a range of serious diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, stroke and type II diabetes. Theory suggests that working long hours will increase smoking propensities among workers. Consequently there is a significant body of evidence on the relationship between working time and smoking. Results, however, are inconsistent and therefore inconclusive. This paper provides new evidence on how working time affects smoking behaviour using nationally representative panel data from Australia (from 2002 to 2011) and the United Kingdom (from 1992 to 2011). We exploit the panel design of the surveys to look at within-person changes in smoking behaviour over time as working time changes. In contrast to most previous studies, this means we control for time invariant aspects of personality and genetic inheritance that may affect both smoking propensities and choice of working hours. We find that working long hours tends to increase the chances that former smokers will relapse, reduce the chances that smokers will quit and increase cigarette consumption among regular smokers, and that these effects tend to become more pronounced for workers who usually work very long hours (50 or more hours a week) compared to those who work moderately long hours (40-49 h a week).

10464299,Phenotypic behavior of caveolin-3 mutations that cause autosomal dominant limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD-1C). Retention of LGMD-1C caveolin-3 mutants within the golgi complex,"Caveolin-3, a muscle-specific caveolin-related protein, is the principal structural protein of caveolae membrane domains in striated muscle cell types (cardiac and skeletal). Autosomal dominant limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD-1C) in humans is due to mutations within the caveolin-3 gene: (i) a 9-base pair microdeletion that removes three amino acids within the caveolin scaffolding domain (DeltaTFT) or (ii) a missense mutation within the membrane spanning domain (P --> L). The molecular mechanisms by which these two mutations cause muscular dystrophy remain unknown. Here, we investigate the phenotypic behavior of these caveolin-3 mutations using heterologous expression. Wild type caveolin-3 or caveolin-3 mutants were transiently expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. LGMD-1C mutants of caveolin-3 (DeltaTFT or P --> L) were primarily retained at the level of a perinuclear compartment that we identified as the Golgi complex in double-labeling experiments, while wild type caveolin-3 was efficiently targeted to the plasma membrane. In accordance with these observations, caveolin-3 mutants formed oligomers of a much larger size than wild type caveolin-3 and were excluded from caveolae-enriched membrane fractions as seen by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. In addition, these caveolin-3 mutants were expressed at significantly lower levels and had a dramatically shortened half-life of approximately 45-60 min. However, caveolin-3 mutants were palmitoylated to the same extent as wild type caveolin-3, indicating that targeting to the plasma membrane is not required for palmitoylation of caveolin-3. In conclusion, we show that LGMD-1C mutations lead to formation of unstable high molecular mass aggregates of caveolin-3 that are retained within the Golgi complex and are not targeted to the plasma membrane. Consistent with its autosomal dominant form of genetic transmission, we demonstrate that LGMD-1C mutants of caveolin-3 behave in a dominant-negative fashion, causing the retention of wild type caveolin-3 at the level of the Golgi. These data provide a molecular explanation for why caveolin-3 levels are down-regulated in patients with this form of limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD-1C).",1
32079168,Free Vibration Analysis of Closed Moderately Thick Cross-Ply Composite Laminated Cylindrical Shell with Arbitrary Boundary Conditions,"A semi-analytic method is adopted to analyze the free vibration characteristics of the moderately thick composite laminated cylindrical shell with arbitrary classical and elastic boundary conditions. By Hamilton's principle and first-order shear deformation theory, the governing equation of the composite shell can be established. The displacement variables are transformed into the wave function forms to ensure the correctness of the governing equation. Based on the kinetic relationship between the displacement variables and force resultants, the final equation associated with arbitrary boundary conditions is established. The dichotomy method is conducted to calculate the natural frequencies of the composite shell. For verifying the correctness of the present method, the results by the present method are compared with those in the pieces of literatures with various boundary conditions. Furthermore, some numerical examples are calculated to investigate the effect of several parameters on the composite shell, such as length to radius ratios, thickness to radius ratios and elastic restrained constants.",0
30679080,Spinal fractures in patients with Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis:A nationwide multi-institution survey,"BACKGROUND: Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) increases the spine's susceptibility to unstable fractures that can cause neurological deterioration. However, the detail of injury is still unclear. A nationwide multicenter retrospective study was conducted to assess the clinical characteristics and radiographic features of spinal fractures in patients with DISH. METHODS: Patients were eligible for this study if they 1) had DISH, defined as flowing ossification along the anterolateral aspect of at least four contiguous vertebral bodies, and 2) had an injury in the ankylosing spine. This study included 285 patients with DISH (221 males, 64 females; mean age 75.2 +/- 9.5 years). RESULTS: The major cause of injury was falling from a standing or sitting position; this affected 146 patients (51.2%). Diagnosis of the fracture was delayed in 115 patients (40.4%). Later neurological deterioration by one or more Frankel grade was seen in 87 patients (30.5%). The following factors were significantly associated with neurological deficits: delayed diagnosis (p = 0.033), injury of the posterior column (p = 0.021), and the presence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) (p < 0.001). The majority of patients (n = 241, 84.6%) were treated surgically, most commonly by conventional open posterior fixation (n = 199, 69.8%). Neurological improvement was seen in 20.0% of the conservatively treated patients, and in 47.0% of the patients treated surgically. CONCLUSIONS: Minor trauma could cause spinal fractures in DISH patients. Delayed diagnosis, injury of the posterior column, and the presence of OPLL were significantly associated with neurological deterioration. Patients with neurological deficits or unstable fractures should be treated by fixation surgery.",0
3445861,New classification of ureter by success rate for transurethro-ureteral lithotripsy,"Between August, 1985 and February, 1987, 4 renal pelvic stones and 49 ureteral stones (28 calculi in the abdominal ureter, 21 in the pelvic ureter) were treated by 55 procedures of transurethro-ureteral lithotripsy (TUL). The success rate for stones in the ureter lying in the paravertebral gutter was 33% (3/9), while those in the ureter overlying the psoas muscle was 85% (17/20). The success rate for calculi impacted at the uretero-vesicle junction was 100% (12/12), and those in the upper part of pelvic ureter was 80% (8/10). Two of 4 renal pelvic stones were successfully fragmented and removed. The overall success rate by the ureterorenoscope was 79% in 53 renoureteral units. Judging from our experience and results of TUL, the stone location seems to be one of the factors affecting the success rate. Thus, we propose a new classification of ureter according to success rate for TUL as follows; uretero-vesical junction, pelvic, psoas, and gutter portion.",0
24310810,The Glasgow Prognostic Score accurately predicts survival in patients with biliary tract cancer not indicated for surgical resection,"The Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are associated with the survival in patients with various types of malignancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of the GPS and NLR in patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC) undergoing palliative chemotherapy or best supportive care (BSC). Fifty-two patients with newly diagnosed BTC were retrospectively evaluated. We investigated the correlation between the GPS, NLR, and the overall survival rates. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was calculated to compare the predictive ability of each score. Both the univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify clinicopathological variables associated with the overall survival. There were significant differences between the GPS groups regarding the neutrophil levels (p < 0.0001), Hb (p = 0.024), Alb (p < 0.0001) and CRP (p < 0.0001). A significant difference in the overall survival was found between the groups stratified based on the GPS, NLR (p < 0.001). The GPS had a higher AUC value (0.905) in comparison to the NLR (0.648). In the multivariate analysis, the sex (p = 0.002), CA19-9 (p < 0.0001) and the GPS (p < 0.0001) were found to be independently associated with the overall survival. Our results demonstrate that the GPS is an independent marker of the prognosis in patients with BTC undergoing palliative chemotherapy or BSC, and is superior to the NLR in terms of its prognostic ability.",0
27690695,Placental leptin mRNA expression and serum leptin levels in pre-eclampsia associated with HIV infection,"Leptin, primarily produced by adipocytes, is implicated in the development of pre-eclampsia. This study examines placental leptin production and serum leptin levels in HIV infected and uninfected normotensive and pre-eclamptic pregnancies. Placental leptin production was analysed by RT-PCR and serum leptin levels by ELISA in normotensive (n = 90) and pre-eclamptic (n = 90) pregnancies which were further stratified by HIV status. Placental leptin production was higher in pre-eclampsia compared to normotensive pregnancies irrespective of HIV status (p = .04). Serum leptin was non-significantly raised in HIV uninfected (p = .42) but lower in HIV-infected (p = .03) pre-eclampsia. The latter had lower BMI (p = .007) and triceps skin-fold thickness (p < .001) than the HIV uninfected groups with a significant correlation between serum leptin and triceps skin-fold thickness (p < .001), indicative of less adipose tissue in HIV-infected women with consequently lower serum leptin. Thus, serum leptin levels are not indicative of increased placental production when pre-eclampsia is associated with HIV infection.",0
12441059,Genetic elimination of behavioral sensitization in mice lacking calmodulin-stimulated adenylyl cyclases,"Adenylyl cyclase types 1 (AC1) and 8 (AC8), the two major calmodulin-stimulated adenylyl cyclases in the brain, couple NMDA receptor activation to cAMP signaling pathways. Cyclic AMP signaling pathways are important for many brain functions, such as learning and memory, drug addiction, and development. Here we show that wild-type, AC1, AC8, or AC1&8 double knockout (DKO) mice were indistinguishable in tests of acute pain, whereas behavioral responses to peripheral injection of two inflammatory stimuli, formalin and complete Freund's adjuvant, were reduced or abolished in AC1&8 DKO mice. AC1 and AC8 are highly expressed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and contribute to inflammation-induced activation of CREB. Intra-ACC administration of forskolin rescued behavioral allodynia defective in the AC1&8 DKO mice. Our studies suggest that AC1 and AC8 in the ACC selectively contribute to behavioral allodynia.",1

17916583,Human angiogenin is a neuroprotective factor and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis associated angiogenin variants affect neurite extension/pathfinding and survival of motor neurons,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper and lower motor neurons (MNs). The molecular mechanisms underlying ALS are poorly understood. Mutations in SOD1 is one of the known causes of ALS but occur only in a very small number of cases of ALS. Interestingly, mutations in human angiogenin (hANG), a member of the ribonuclease A (RNase A) superfamily known to be involved in neovascularization, have been recently reported in patients with ALS, but the effects of these mutations on MN differentiation and survival has not been investigated. We have used the well-characterized pluripotent P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell culture model of neuro-ectodermal differentiation to study the effects of hANG-ALS variants on MN differentiation and survival. Here we report that P19 EC cells induced to differentiate in the presence of hANG and hANG-ALS-associated variants internalize the wild-type and variant proteins. The P19 EC cells differentiate to form neurons but the ability of the neurites to extend and make contacts with neighbouring neurites is compromised when treated with the hANG-ALS variants. In addition, hANG-ALS variants also have a cytotoxic effect on MNs leading to their degeneration. hANG was able to protect neurons from hypoxia-induced cell death, but the variants of hANG implicated in ALS lacked the neuroprotective activity. Our findings show that ANG plays an important role in neurite extension/pathfinding and survival providing a causal link between mutations in hANG and ALS.",1
9628810,"Primary sequence, secondary structure, gene structure, and assembly properties suggests that the lens-specific cytoskeletal protein filensin represents a novel class of intermediate filament protein","The ocular lens fiber cell assembles a novel cytoskeletal element, the Beaded Filament, from CP49 and filensin, two proteins expressed only in the differentiated lens fiber cell. We report the primary sequence, secondary structural analysis, gene structure and Yeast Two Hybrid interaction data for human filensin, and develop a consensus model of filensin from the human and previously reported bovine and chicken filensin sequences. This consensus model, combined with gene structure and Yeast Two Hybrid studies establish that filensin is a member of the Intermediate Filament family of proteins. Specifically, filensin exhibits (1) divergence at amino acid sequence motifs otherwise highly conserved among intermediate filament proteins, (2) a loss of 29 amino acids from the central rod domain which is unique among cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins, (3) an absence of sequence identity with any existing class of intermediate filament protein, (4) a gene structure unique among intermediate filament family, (5) an inability to dimerize with representatives of Type I, II, and III intermediate filament proteins. Thus, at each level of analysis, we find that filensin is similar to the consensus model of intermediate filament proteins, supporting our conclusion that filensin's relatedness to the IF family is not the consequence of convergent evolution. However, filensin also shows unique or extreme distinctions from the consensus intermediate filament protein at each level of analysis, indicating that filensin constitutes a novel class of IF protein. Some of filensin's unique features are incompatible with current models of IF assembly. Analysis of filensin gene structure suggests that the 29 amino acid reduction in the central rod domain was not the result of a single splice site mutation, the mechanism suggested for the transition between nuclear lamins and cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins.",1
3026784,Cyclic hormonogenesis in gray collie dogs: interactions of hematopoietic and endocrine systems,"Cortisol, ACTH, T4, and T3 concentrations were determined in six cyclic hematopoietic (CH) dogs to determine if hormonal cycles were a feature of this hematopoietic disorder. It was determined that there were 12- to 14-day cycles of these hormones in CH dogs. Plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations peaked 4-8 days after the onset of neutropenia and were concurrent with peak neutrophil counts. The peak ACTH concentration occurred 1-2 days before or concurrent with the cortisol peak concentration. T4 and T3 peak concentrations were opposite the cortisol cycles, and maximal concentrations were seen when cortisol levels were lowest. ACTH, GH-releasing factor and TRH response tests were performed in the CH dogs. No frank deficiencies in hormone production were seen with the ACTH, GH-releasing factor, and TRH responses in CH dogs relative to those in normal dogs. It was concluded that cyclic hormonogenesis is a central feature of CH disease. These findings are the first demonstration of extrahematopoietic system cyclicity in this rare disease and suggest the presence of common regulatory factors in the hematopoietic and endocrine systems.",1
22722845,A tumour suppressor network relying on the polyamine-hypusine axis,"Tumour suppressor genes encode a broad class of molecules whose mutational attenuation contributes to malignant progression. In the canonical situation, the tumour suppressor is completely inactivated through a two-hit process involving a point mutation in one allele and chromosomal deletion of the other. Here, to identify tumour suppressor genes in lymphoma, we screen a short hairpin RNA library targeting genes deleted in human lymphomas. We functionally identify those genes whose suppression promotes tumorigenesis in a mouse lymphoma model. Of the nine tumour suppressors we identified, eight correspond to genes occurring in three physically linked 'clusters', suggesting that the common occurrence of large chromosomal deletions in human tumours reflects selective pressure to attenuate multiple genes. Among the new tumour suppressors are adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 (AMD1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), two genes associated with hypusine, a unique amino acid produced as a product of polyamine metabolism through a highly conserved pathway. Through a secondary screen surveying the impact of all polyamine enzymes on tumorigenesis, we establish the polyamine-hypusine axis as a new tumour suppressor network regulating apoptosis. Unexpectedly, heterozygous deletions encompassing AMD1 and eIF5A often occur together in human lymphomas and co-suppression of both genes promotes lymphomagenesis in mice. Thus, some tumour suppressor functions can be disabled through a two-step process targeting different genes acting in the same pathway.",1
7069248,Studies on relationship between complement and blood coagulation system in toxemia of pregnancy (author's transl),"Presence of chronic DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) eliciting an impeded blood coagulation has been postulated of late as one of the etiology causing toxemia of pregnancy, for which studies have been immunologically made. These theories remain unestablished. In this regard, the role of complement in blood coagulation has been noted, and their correlation is being elucidated. The author introduced a concept of complement to etiological theory of an impeded blood coagulation origin, by which toxemia of pregnancy was studied with emphasis placed on their correlation. The results obtained are as follow: 1) Thrombin and thromboplastin allowed in vitro to decreases the potency of complement, and the lowering also was seen even in the case of simultaneous supplement of urokinase and plasminogen. 2) The decrease also was periodically seen in rabbit's DIC experimentally made. 3) An increase in CH50, C3, C4, and factor B of normal pregnancy were of significance when compared with those of the control (p less than 0.001), while C1 inactivator decreased significantly (p less than 0.001). 4) CH50 was 52.2 +/- 2.4U/ml in severe toxemia, a decrease being of significance (p less than 0.01) as compared with that in third trimester of normal pregnancy. Those other parameters which tended to decrease included hemolytic activity of alternative pathway (AP-CH50), C4, and factor B except C1 inactivator with a trend being high.",0
16002881,Value of routine funduscopy in patients with hypertension: systematic review,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the additional value of funduscopy in the routine management of patients with hypertension. DESIGN: Systematic review. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 19 or more with hypertensive retinopathy. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from 1990. REVIEW METHODS: Studies were included that assessed hypertensive retinopathy with blinding for blood pressure and cardiovascular risk factors. Studies on observer agreement had to be assessed by two or more observers and expressed as a kappa statistic. Studies on the association between hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive organ damage were carried out in patients with hypertension. The association between hypertensive retinopathy and cardiovascular risk was carried out in unselected normotensive and hypertensive people without diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: The assessment of microvascular changes in the retina is limited by large variation between observers. The positive and negative predictive values for the association between hypertensive retinopathy and blood pressure were low (47% to 72% and 32% to 67%, respectively). Associations between retinal microvascular changes and cardiovascular risk were inconsistent, except for retinopathy and stroke. The increased risk of stroke, however, was also present in normotensive people with retinopathy. These studies did not adjust for other indicators of hypertensive organ damage. CONCLUSION: Evidence is lacking that routine funduscopy is of additional value in the management of hypertensive patients.",0
11524682,Crystal structure of the APC10/DOC1 subunit of the human anaphase-promoting complex,"The anaphase-promoting complex (APC), or cyclosome, is a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis and the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The APC is composed of at least 11 subunits; no structure has been determined for any of these subunits. The subunit APC10/DOC1, a one-domain protein consisting of 185 amino acids, has a conserved core (residues 22-161) that is homologous to domains found in several other putative ubiquitin ligases and, therefore, may play a role in ubiquitination reactions. Here we report the crystal structure of human APC10 at 1.6 A resolution. The core of the protein is formed by a beta-sandwich that adopts a jellyroll fold. Unexpectedly, this structure is highly similar to ligand-binding domains of several bacterial and eukaryotic proteins, such as galactose oxidase and coagulation factor Va, raising the possibility that APC10 may function by binding a yet unidentified ligand. We further provide biochemical evidence that the C-terminus of APC10 binds to CDC27/APC3, an APC subunit that contains multiple tetratrico peptide repeats.",1
12164822,Cellular responses to Schistosoma japonicum cathepsin D aspartic protease,"Lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production were measured in groups of mice vaccinated (but not subsequently challenge infected) with recombinant forms of Schistosoma japonicum cathepsin D aspartic protease, rSjASP1 (expressed in bacteria; enzymatically inactive) and rSjASP2 (expressed in insect cells; enzymatically active). Both forms of the schistosome enzyme induced significant proliferation of splenocytes recovered from vaccinated mice, and expression of interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 mRNA in these cells was detected using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Secretion of IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 by splenocytes from vaccinated mice was confirmed and quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IFN-gamma was the most abundant cytokine produced, followed by IL-4 and IL-10 in rank order. These findings indicated that vaccination of mice with the schistosome protease induces a mixed Th1/Th2 cytokine response, which may explain the modest level of protection after challenge infection in cathepsin D-vaccinated mice, reported previously.",0

25527877,Extent of preoperative depression is associated with return to work after lumbar fusion for spondylolisthesis,"BACKGROUND: The ability to understand factors associated with an increased duration of missed work postoperatively could be used to more effectively select patients with the greatest opportunity for a successful outcome. We set out to determine the effect of preoperative depression on postoperative return to work in patients undergoing transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) for degenerative spondylolisthesis. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients undergoing TLIF for symptomatic grade I degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis were included in this analysis. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, indications for surgery, radiologic studies, and operative variables were assessed for each case. Patient-assessed outcome measures were obtained prospectively at baseline and 2 years postoperatively. To understand the factors associated with prolonged return to work, univariate linear regression analysis and stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used. RESULTS: All patient-reported outcomes assessed were significantly improved 2 years after TLIF (P < 0.001). Of the 32 patients working preoperatively, 26 (81%) returned to work postoperatively. Median time to return to work was 56 days (range, 10-150 days). Independent of patient age; preoperative pain, disability, and quality of life; and extent of postoperative improvement, increased preoperative Zung depression score remained associated with prolonged return to work (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Independent of postoperative improvement in pain, disability, and quality of life, the extent of preoperative depression was an independent predictor of time to return to work in patients undergoing TLIF for spondylolisthesis, suggesting that regardless of how successful TLIF surgery may be at improving a patient's pain, disability, or quality of life, greater depression will delay or prohibit their ability to return to work postoperatively.",0
33093187,Refined prediction of pharmacokinetic kratom-drug interactions: time-dependent inhibition considerations,"Preparations from the leaves of the kratom plant (Mitragyna speciosa) are consumed for their opioid-like effects. Several deaths have been associated with kratom used concomitantly with some drugs. Pharmacokinetic interactions are potential underlying mechanisms of these fatalities. Accumulating in vitro evidence has demonstrated select kratom alkaloids, including the abundant indole alkaloid mitragynine, as reversible inhibitors of several cytochromes P450 (CYPs). The objective of this work was to refine the mechanistic understanding of potential kratom-drug interactions by considering both reversible and time-dependent CYP inhibition (TDI) in the liver and intestine. Mitragynine was tested against CYP2C9 (diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation), CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan O-demethylation), and CYP3A (midazolam 1'-hydroxylation) activities in human liver microsomes (HLMs) and CYP3A activity in human intestinal microsomes (HIMs). Comparing the absence to presence of NADPH during pre-incubation of mitragynine with HLMs or HIMs, an ~7-fold leftward shift in IC50 (~20 to 3 muM) towards CYP3A resulted, prompting determination of TDI parameters (HLMs: KI , 4.1 {plus minus} 0.9 muM; kinact , 0.068 {plus minus} 0.01 min(-1); HIMs: KI , 4.2 {plus minus} 2.5 muM; kinact , 0.079 {plus minus} 0.02 min(-1)). Mitragynine caused no leftward shift in IC50 towards CYP2C9 (~40 muM) and CYP2D6 (~1 muM) but was a strong competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki , 1.17 {plus minus} 0.07 muM). Using a recommended mechanistic static model, mitragynine (2-g kratom dose) was predicted to increase dextromethorphan and midazolam area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by 1.06 and 5.69-fold, respectively. The predicted midazolam AUC ratio exceeded the recommended cut-off (1.25), which would have been missed if TDI was not considered. Significance Statement Kratom, a botanical natural product increasingly consumed for its opioid-like effects, may precipitate potentially serious pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs. The abundant kratom indole alkaloid, mitragynine, was shown to be a time-dependent inhibitor of hepatic and intestinal cytochrome P450 3A activity. A mechanistic static model predicted mitragynine to increase systemic exposure to the probe drug substrate midazolam by 5.7-fold, necessitating further evaluation via dynamic models and clinical assessment to advance understanding of consumer safety associated with kratom use.",0
19081515,Genetic risk factors for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: a genome-wide association study,"BACKGROUND: Human and animal prion diseases are under genetic control, but apart from PRNP (the gene that encodes the prion protein), we understand little about human susceptibility to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) prions, the causal agent of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). METHODS: We did a genome-wide association study of the risk of vCJD and tested for replication of our findings in samples from many categories of human prion disease (929 samples) and control samples from the UK and Papua New Guinea (4254 samples), including controls in the UK who were genotyped by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. We also did follow-up analyses of the genetic control of the clinical phenotype of prion disease and analysed candidate gene expression in a mouse cellular model of prion infection. FINDINGS: The PRNP locus was strongly associated with risk across several markers and all categories of prion disease (best single SNP [single nucleotide polymorphism] association in vCJD p=2.5 x 10(-17); best haplotypic association in vCJD p=1 x 10(-24)). Although the main contribution to disease risk was conferred by PRNP polymorphic codon 129, another nearby SNP conferred increased risk of vCJD. In addition to PRNP, one technically validated SNP association upstream of RARB (the gene that encodes retinoic acid receptor beta) had nominal genome-wide significance (p=1.9 x 10(-7)). A similar association was found in a small sample of patients with iatrogenic CJD (p=0.030) but not in patients with sporadic CJD (sCJD) or kuru. In cultured cells, retinoic acid regulates the expression of the prion protein. We found an association with acquired prion disease, including vCJD (p=5.6 x 10(-5)), kuru incubation time (p=0.017), and resistance to kuru (p=2.5 x 10(-4)), in a region upstream of STMN2 (the gene that encodes SCG10). The risk genotype was not associated with sCJD but conferred an earlier age of onset. Furthermore, expression of Stmn2 was reduced 30-fold post-infection in a mouse cellular model of prion disease. INTERPRETATION: The polymorphic codon 129 of PRNP was the main genetic risk factor for vCJD; however, additional candidate loci have been identified, which justifies functional analyses of these biological pathways in prion disease.",0

33103450,Holistic Characterization of Single Hepatocyte Transcriptome Responses to High Fat Diet,"During nutritional overload and obesity, hepatocyte function is grossly altered, and a subset of hepatocytes begins to accumulate fat droplets, leading to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recent single cell studies revealed how non-parenchymal cells, such as macrophages, hepatic stellate cells, and endothelial cells, heterogeneously respond to NAFLD. However, it remains to be characterized how hepatocytes, the major constituents of the liver, respond to nutritional overload in NAFLD. Here, using droplet-based single cell RNA-sequencing (Drop-seq), we characterized how the transcriptomic landscape of individual hepatocytes is altered in response to high-fat diet (HFD) and NAFLD. We showed that entire hepatocytes population undergoes substantial transcriptome changes upon HFD, although the patterns of alteration were highly heterogeneous with zonation-dependent and -independent effects. Periportal (zone 1) hepatocytes downregulated many zone 1-specific marker genes, while a small number of genes mediating gluconeogenesis were upregulated. Pericentral (zone 3) hepatocytes also downregulated many zone 3-specific genes; however, they upregulated several genes that promote HFD-induced fat droplet formation, consistent with findings that zone 3 hepatocytes accumulate more lipid droplets. Zone 3 hepatocytes also upregulated ketogenic pathways as an adaptive mechanism to HFD. Interestingly, many of the top HFD-induced genes, which encode proteins regulating lipid metabolism, were strongly co-expressed with each other in a subset of hepatocytes, producing a variegated pattern of spatial co-localization that is independent of metabolic zonation. In conclusion, our dataset provides a useful resource for understanding hepatocellular alteration during NAFLD at single cell level.",0
27167256,Benchmarking of five commercial deformable image registration algorithms for head and neck patients,"Benchmarking is a process in which standardized tests are used to assess system performance. The data produced in the process are important for comparative purposes, particularly when considering the implementation and quality assurance of DIR algorithms. In this work, five commercial DIR algorithms (MIM, Velocity, RayStation, Pinnacle, and Eclipse) were benchmarked using a set of 10 virtual phantoms. The phantoms were previously developed based on CT data collected from real head and neck patients. Each phantom includes a start of treatment CT dataset, an end of treatment CT dataset, and the ground-truth deformation vector field (DVF) which links them together. These virtual phantoms were imported into the commercial systems and registered through a deformable process. The resulting DVFs were compared to the ground-truth DVF to determine the target registration error (TRE) at every voxel within the image set. Real treatment plans were also recalculated on each end of treatment CT dataset and the dose transferred according to both the ground-truth and test DVFs. Dosimetric changes were assessed, and TRE was correlated with changes in the DVH of individual structures. In the first part of the study, results show mean TRE on the order of 0.5 mm to 3 mm for all phan-toms and ROIs. In certain instances, however, misregistrations were encountered which produced mean and max errors up to 6.8 mm and 22 mm, respectively. In the second part of the study, dosimetric error was found to be strongly correlated with TRE in the brainstem, but weakly correlated with TRE in the spinal cord. Several interesting cases were assessed which highlight the interplay between the direction and magnitude of TRE and the dose distribution, including the slope of dosimetric gradients and the distance to critical structures. This information can be used to help clinicians better implement and test their algorithms, and also understand the strengths and weaknesses of a dose adaptive approach.",0
18280838,Ambulatory blood pressure and increased left ventricular mass in children at risk for hypertension,"OBJECTIVE: To relate ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) to cardiac target organ measurement in children at risk for primary hypertension (HTN). STUDY DESIGN: Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and ABP were measured concomitantly in children (6 to 18 years) at risk for hypertension using a cross-sectional study design. RESULTS: LVMI showed a significant positive correlation with 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) load, SBP index (SBPI), and standard deviation score (SDS). When subjects were stratified by LVMI percentile, there were significant differences in SBP load, 24-hour SBPI, and 24-hour SSDS. The odds ratio (OR) of having elevated LVMI increased by 54% for each incremental increase of SDS in 24-hour SSDS after controlling for race and BMI (OR = 1.54, unit = 1 SDS, CI = 1.1, 2.15, P = .011) and increased by 88% for each increase of 0.1 in BPI (OR = 1.88, CI = 1.03, 3.45, P = .04). Subjects with stage 3 HTN had significantly greater mean LVMI compared with normal subjects (P = .002 by ANOVA; LMVI, 31.6 +/- 7.9 versus 39.5 +/- 10.4). CONCLUSIONS: As systolic ABP variables increase, there is greater likelihood for increased LVMI. Staging based on ABPM allows assessment of cardiovascular risk in children with primary hypertension.",0
25356988,Autophagy controls BCG-induced trained immunity and the response to intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer,"The anti-tuberculosis-vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the most widely used vaccine in the world. In addition to its effects against tuberculosis, BCG vaccination also induces non-specific beneficial effects against certain forms of malignancy and against infections with unrelated pathogens. It has been recently proposed that the non-specific effects of BCG are mediated through epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes, a process called trained immunity. In the present study we demonstrate that autophagy contributes to trained immunity induced by BCG. Pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy blocked trained immunity induced in vitro by stimuli such as beta-glucans or BCG. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the autophagy genes ATG2B (rs3759601) and ATG5 (rs2245214) influenced both the in vitro and in vivo training effect of BCG upon restimulation with unrelated bacterial or fungal stimuli. Furthermore, pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of autophagy blocked epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes at the level of H3K4 trimethylation. Finally, we demonstrate that rs3759601 in ATG2B correlates with progression and recurrence of bladder cancer after BCG intravesical instillation therapy. These findings identify a key role of autophagy for the nonspecific protective effects of BCG. ",1
2877702,Does propranolol have an antipsychotic effect? A placebo-controlled study in acute schizophrenia,"Thirty-six acute schizophrenics were randomly assigned to dextro (d)-propranolol or placebo in a double blind trial lasting four weeks. All patients had a fixed dose of haloperidol during the first week, which resulted in an initial improvement in both groups. Thereafter, a deterioration towards base-line was seen. Six patients on placebo, but none on propranolol were treatment failures at the end of three weeks (P less than 0.001). Comparison of change in scores from week 2 to 4 showed significantly greater deterioration in the placebo group; d-propranolol thus had a better effect than placebo in sustaining the initial improvement with haloperidol. The overall magnitude of clinical change from pre-treatment scores is small, the majority of the patients showing little or no overall improvement. It is concluded that d-propranolol has a detectable therapeutic effect, which by inference must have a novel pharmacological basis, but this is not as potent as standard neuroleptics.",0
19067018,The Schneiderian membrane contains osteoprogenitor cells: in vivo and in vitro study,"Recent studies successfully demonstrated induction of new bone formation in the maxillary sinus by mucosal membrane lifting without the use of any graft material. The aim of this work was to test the osteogenic potential of human maxillary sinus Schneiderian membrane (hMSSM) using both in vitro and in vivo assays. Samples of hMSSM were used for establishment of cell cultures and for histological studies. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on P(0), P(1), and P(2) cultures using established mesenchymal progenitor cell markers (CD 105, CD 146, CD 71, CD 73, CD 166), and the ability of hMSSM cells to undergo osteogenic differentiation in culture was analyzed using relevant in vitro assays. Results showed that hMSSM cells could be induced to express alkaline phosphatase, bone morphogenic protein-2, osteopontin, osteonectin, and osteocalcin and to mineralize their extracellular matrix. Inherent osteogenic potential of hMSSM-derived cells was further proven by in vivo experiments, which demonstrated the formation of histology-proven bone at ectopic sites following transplantation of hMSSM-derived cells in conjunction with an osteoconductive scaffold. This study provides the biological background for understanding the observed clinical phenomena in sinus lifting. Our results show that a genuine osteogenic potential is associated with the hMSSM and can contribute to development of successful sinus augmentation techniques.",0
16758486,Combining docking and molecular dynamic simulations in drug design,"A rational approach is needed to maximize the chances of finding new drugs, and to exploit the opportunities of potential new drug targets emerging from genomic and proteomic initiatives, and from the large libraries of small compounds now readily available through combinatorial chemistry. Despite a shaky early history, computer-aided drug design techniques can now be effective in reducing costs and speeding up drug discovery. This happy outcome results from development of more accurate and reliable algorithms, use of more thoughtfully planned strategies to apply them, and greatly increased computer power to allow studies with the necessary reliability to be performed. Our review focuses on applications and protocols, with the main emphasis on critical analysis of recent studies where docking calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were combined to dock small molecules into protein receptors. We highlight successes to demonstrate what is possible now, but also point out drawbacks and future directions. The review is structured to lead the reader from the simpler to more compute-intensive methods. Thus, while inexpensive and fast docking algorithms can be used to scan large compound libraries and reduce their size, more accurate but expensive MD simulations can be applied when a few selected ligand candidates remain. MD simulations can be used: during the preparation of the protein receptor before docking, to optimize its structure and account for protein flexibility; for the refinement of docked complexes, to include solvent effects and account for induced fit; to calculate binding free energies, to provide an accurate ranking of the potential ligands; and in the latest developments, during the docking process itself to find the binding site and correctly dock the ligand a priori.",0
7949540,Cutaneous cryptococcosis mimicking bacterial cellulitis in a liver transplant recipient: case report and review in solid organ transplant recipients,"Cutaneous cryptococcosis is an uncommon manifestation of disseminated cryptococcal disease. We report a liver transplant recipient presenting with onset over 3 days of progressive pain and swelling of the lower extremity and foot with erythema and heat. Cryptococcal cellulitis was documented, but in retrospect the clinical presentation was indistinguishable in presentation and appearance from acute bacterial cellulitis. The patient also proved to have concomitant cryptococcal septic arthritis; the presence of cryptococcal antigen in the synovial fluid allowed a rapid and definitive diagnosis. Subsequently, cultures of skin, synovial fluid, and blood were all positive for cryptococci. Cryptococcus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bacterial cellulitis in a liver transplant recipient not responding to antibacterial therapy.",0
10718485,"Sex hormone-induced mammary carcinogenesis in female Noble rats: expression of TGF-beta1 and its receptors, TGF-alpha, and EGF-R in mammary carcinogenesis","We have established a Noble rat model to explore the mechanisms of hormonal mammary carcinogenesis, in which the role of androgen in promoting mammary carcinogenesis was highlighted. We have also established that stromal-epithelial interactions may be responsible for the promotional effects of testosterone in mammary carcinogenesis. Based on these understandings, in the present study we examined the expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) and its receptors (TGF-beta RI, TGF-beta RII), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) in 'pre-malignant' mammary glands treated with different protocols of sex hormones, as well as in mammary cancers. We observed that TGF-beta1 was strongly expressed in most mammary tumors, whereas TGF-beta RI and TGF-beta RII were negative in most mammary tumor cells. The results from comparative study of 'pre-malignant' glands further showed that when the animals were treated with testosterone, either alone or in combination with 17beta-estradiol, the mammary gland epithelial cells expressed high levels of TGF-beta1. This over-expression of TGF-beta1 can be blocked by flutamide, indicating that testosterone may be responsible for the expression of TGF-beta1 in mammary glands. TGF-beta RI and TGF-beta RII were also expressed strongly in testosterone-treated mammary epithelial cells and only weakly detectable in 17beta-estradiol treated and control mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, TGF-beta RI and TGF-beta RII were also expressed in stromal cells, both in mammary tumors and in hormone-treated mammary glands. These observations indicate that the mechanism of testosterone in mammary carcinogenesis may be through its regulation of expression of TGF-beta1 and its receptors. On the other hand, TGF-alpha was also expressed in all 39 mammary cancers, while only 81% of the cancers were EGF-R positive. TGF-alpha was also strongly expressed in stromal cells in all three experimental groups, but only moderately expressed in epithelial cells when treated with a combination of testosterone and 17beta-estradiol. By contrast, EGF-R was strongly expressed in epithelial cells in the three experimental groups but negative in stromal cells. Flutamide or tamoxifen was unable to block the expression of TGF-alpha induced by the combined sex hormone treatment. However, they were effective in blocking the expression of TGF-alpha when the animals were treated with testosterone or 17beta-estradiol alone, respectively. These results suggest that both testosterone and 17beta-estradiol may be required for the over-expression of TGF-alpha in the mammary carcinogenesis induced by sex hormones. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study to explore the regulation of TGF-beta1, TGF-alpha, and their receptors by testosterone and 17beta-estradiol in mammary carcinogenesis.",0
22378967,Predispensing of antivirals to high-risk individuals in an influenza pandemic,"We consider the net benefits of predispensing antivirals to high-risk individuals during an influenza pandemic, where the measure of the benefit is the number of lives saved by antivirals in the whole population. Predispensing has two potential benefits: first, individuals to whom antivirals have been predispensed may be able to initiate treatment earlier than if they had to wait to obtain and fill a prescription, reducing their risk of progression to severe disease. Second, if demand exceeds supply, predispensing to high-risk individuals increases the chance that the course will be used by a high-risk, rather than a low-risk individual. The disadvantage of predispensing is that a course may be sequestered by a person who does not need it (because s/he does not become infected) or wastes it (using it for something other than influenza). We derive mathematical conditions under which the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and suggest that for individuals at considerably higher than average risk of death from pandemic influenza (for example, greater than approximately 5x the population average risk), predispensing of antivirals up to perhaps 20% of the total antiviral stockpile is very likely to result in a net savings of life. Data to parameterize this model are limited, but we believe such a policy would be robust to a reasonable range of uncertainty, and we note that decisions about predispensing will need to be made before definitive data are available. More precise estimates of the relative risk of death for groups beyond pregnant women are urgently needed for decision making about prioritization of antivirals, vaccines and other countermeasures.",0
12630962,The I allele of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene is associated with an increased percentage of slow-twitch type I fibers in human skeletal muscle,"The insertion (I) allele of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with lower serum and tissue ACE activity, and with greater endurance performance and enhanced mechanical efficiency of trained muscle. We tested the hypothesis that the ACE-I allele may be associated with increased slow-twitch fiber, which is more efficient than fast-twitch fiber in low-velocity contraction, by examining the association between the ACE genotype and skeletal muscle fiber (SMF) types in 41 untrained healthy young volunteer subjects (31 males, 10 females, age 24 +/- 3 years). Skeletal muscle samples were taken from the left vastus lateralis using the needle-biopsy method. Slow-twitch type I fibers and fast-twitch type IIa and IIb fibers were classified histochemically based on staining for myosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity at different pH values. Amylase-periodic acid-Schiff staining was used to visualize capillaries around fibers. ACE-II subjects had significantly (p < 0.01) higher percentages of type I fibers (50.1 +/- 13.9%vs 30.5 +/- 13.3%) and lower percentages of type IIb fibers (16.2 +/- 6.6%vs 32.9 +/- 7.4%) than ACE-DD subjects. The linear trends for decreases in type I fibers and increases in type IIb fibers from ACE-II --> ID --> DD genotypes were significant as assessed by an analysis of variance. The ratio of type I:II fibers also differed according to the ACE genotype. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the ACE-I allele had significant additive and recessive (codominant) effects on the increased type I fibers and the ratio of type I:II fibers. No specific pattern of capillarization was observed among the three ACE genotypes. In conclusion, the ACE-I allele was associated with increased type I SMF, which may be a mechanism for the association between the ACE genotype and endurance performance.",1
22426308,Mutations affecting components of the SWI/SNF complex cause Coffin-Siris syndrome,"By exome sequencing, we found de novo SMARCB1 mutations in two of five individuals with typical Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), a rare autosomal dominant anomaly syndrome. As SMARCB1 encodes a subunit of the SWItch/Sucrose NonFermenting (SWI/SNF) complex, we screened 15 other genes encoding subunits of this complex in 23 individuals with CSS. Twenty affected individuals (87%) each had a germline mutation in one of six SWI/SNF subunit genes, including SMARCB1, SMARCA4, SMARCA2, SMARCE1, ARID1A and ARID1B.",1
14715834,"Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism is rarely caused by germline mutation in HRPT2, the gene for the hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome","Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP) can result occasionally from the incomplete expression of a syndromic form of familial hyperparathyroidism (HPT), specifically multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, or the hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT). The cause of FIHP has not been identified in the majority of families. We investigated 32 families with FIHP to determine the frequency of occult mutation in HRPT2, the gene causing HPT-JT. All families had negative clinical testing for MEN1, hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and HPT-JT and negative mutational screening of MEN1 and CASR, the gene for the calcium-sensing receptor. Thus, an extended effort was made to exclude each of the principal syndromic causes of FIHP. The families were characterized by young probands (42 +/- 3 yr) and occasionally unusual parathyroid histology, including four families with one case of parathyroid cancer. We had speculated that there was a high frequency of occult mutation in HRPT2 among such carefully screened kindreds. This hypothesis became testable with the recent identification of that gene. Among the 32 FIHP families, only a single one was found to have a mutation in HRPT2 (679insAG); this mutation predicts premature truncation of its gene product, parafibromin, and thus its presumed inactivation. Even accounting for families with one of the three occult syndromes and false negative biochemical or DNA testing, these results indicate that an unexpectedly large fraction of FIHP has currently unrecognized causes.",1
20726197,Apolipoprotein B in type 2 diabetics--a cross sectional study in a tertiary care set-up,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the pattern of dyslipidaemias including apolipoprotein B in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total of 120 diabetics were studied for their lipid profile including serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in fasting state, along with apolipoprotein B levels. RESULTS: Raised apolipoprotein B was the most frequent lipid disorder in type 2 diabetics, occurring in 56.7% of the studied patients. This was followed by high serum triglycerides levels in 55.8% and low HDL cholesterol levels in 55% of patients. Notably, 6% patients had normal triglyceride levels accompanied by raised LDL cholesterol, compared to 20% patients who had normal triglycerides with high apolipoprotein B levels. Overall, 36% of patients had normal LDL cholesterol values but elevated apolipoprotein B. CONCLUSION: Apolipoprotein B is the most frequently occurring dyslipidaemia in type 2 diabetes. It identifies individuals with high risk of coronary heart disease not otherwise detected on routine lipid profile.",0

Approximately 40% of the residents were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive. Two hundred thirty-five residents presented with clinical evidence of a flulike syndrome that was confirmed to be Q fever; moreover, a large proportion of residents developed an asymptomatic infection. Clinical signs and symptoms were rather nonspecific: fever, malaise, and muscle pain that were often associated with pulmonary symptoms. Single or multiple opacities were detected, with mild interstitial inflammation evident on chest roentgenograms. The source of infection was the sheepfold, which is part of the stock-farming activity of the community. Both outbreaks occurred just after lambing had begun. Residents who were exposed during the first epidemic were protected in the second one. The attack rate among HIV-positive residents was significantly higher than that among HIV-negative residents in the first outbreak, whereas only a slight, marginally significant difference was observed in the second outbreak. The clinical features of Q fever did not differ between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. No cases of relapse or chronic disease were observed.",0
24463883,Clinical whole-genome sequencing in severe early-onset epilepsy reveals new genes and improves molecular diagnosis,"In severe early-onset epilepsy, precise clinical and molecular genetic diagnosis is complex, as many metabolic and electro-physiological processes have been implicated in disease causation. The clinical phenotypes share many features such as complex seizure types and developmental delay. Molecular diagnosis has historically been confined to sequential testing of candidate genes known to be associated with specific sub-phenotypes, but the diagnostic yield of this approach can be low. We conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on six patients with severe early-onset epilepsy who had previously been refractory to molecular diagnosis, and their parents. Four of these patients had a clinical diagnosis of Ohtahara Syndrome (OS) and two patients had severe non-syndromic early-onset epilepsy (NSEOE). In two OS cases, we found de novo non-synonymous mutations in the genes KCNQ2 and SCN2A. In a third OS case, WGS revealed paternal isodisomy for chromosome 9, leading to identification of the causal homozygous missense variant in KCNT1, which produced a substantial increase in potassium channel current. The fourth OS patient had a recessive mutation in PIGQ that led to exon skipping and defective glycophosphatidyl inositol biosynthesis. The two patients with NSEOE had likely pathogenic de novo mutations in CBL and CSNK1G1, respectively. Mutations in these genes were not found among 500 additional individuals with epilepsy. This work reveals two novel genes for OS, KCNT1 and PIGQ. It also uncovers unexpected genetic mechanisms and emphasizes the power of WGS as a clinical tool for making molecular diagnoses, particularly for highly heterogeneous disorders.",1
2585425,Exclusion from resuscitation,"Resuscitation was attempted for 156 (19.9%) of the 783 cases in St Thomas's Hospital, aged 16 or over, who suffered first cardiac or respiratory arrest of the current admission during the year to 13 April 1987. Seventeen (11%) of the 156 were discharged alive from hospital after resuscitation. All seventeen had been active outside the home before admission, and all except one remained so after discharge. The factors which were associated with exclusion from resuscitation attempts are analysed. Most accorded with known prognostic factors, but resuscitation was attempted for some persons who seemed to have little chance of benefiting from resuscitation attempts. Routine collection, analysis, and dissemination of information on pre-arrest characteristics in relation to their outcome, on which clinicians can base their decision to with-hold resuscitation in the event of an arrest, is recommended.",0
6496723,Solute-excluded volumes near the Novikoff cell surface,"A differential centrifugation technique, in which all extracellular water except that intimately associated with the cell (pericellular domain) is removed, has been applied to isolated Novikoff hepatoma cells. The pericellular volumes accessible to albumin, inulin, raffinose, and sucrose were inversely related to the molecular weights of the test solutes. This phenomenon was not detectable in erythrocytes or in fat cells. Selective removal of cell surface components by enzymatic treatment produced proportional changes in the relative volumes of distribution accessible to the solutes. This discrimination in the volume accessible to each of the solutes is analogous to that obtained in gel chromatographic separation and represents, in effect, excluded volumes which are inversely related to solute size. This exclusion is associated with components of the Novikoff cell surface, including the surface coat and the microvilli that cover the Novikoff cell. These structures provide an additional level of discrimination for the Novikoff cell not seen in certain other cell types.",0
19162251,"Studies of interaction of homo-dimeric ferredoxin-NAD(P)+ oxidoreductases of Bacillus subtilis and Rhodopseudomonas palustris, that are closely related to thioredoxin reductases in amino acid sequence, with ferredoxins and pyridine nucleotide coenzymes","Ferredoxin-NADP(+) oxidoreductases (FNRs) of Bacillus subtilis (YumC) and Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009 (RPA3954) belong to a novel homo-dimeric type of FNR with high amino acid sequence homology to NADPH-thioredoxin reductases. These FNRs were purified from expression constructs in Escherichia coli cells, and their steady-state reactions with [2Fe-2S] type ferredoxins (Fds) from spinach and R. palustris, [4Fe-4S] type Fd from B. subtilis, NAD(P)(+)/NAD(P)H and ferricyanide were studied. From the K(m) and k(cat) values for the diaphorase activity with ferricyanide, it is demonstrated that both FNRs are far more specific for NADPH than for NADH. The UV-visible spectral changes induced by NADP(+) and B. subtilis Fd indicated that both FNRs form a ternary complex with NADP(+) and Fd, and that each of the two ligands decreases the affinities of the others. The steady-state kinetics of NADPH-cytochrome c reduction activity of YumC is consistent with formation of a ternary complex of NADPH and Fd during catalysis. These results indicate that despite their low sequence homology to other FNRs, these enzymes possess high FNR activity but with measurable differences in affinity for different types of Fds as compared to other more conventional FNRs.",0
17997967,Molecular interactions between a recombinant IgE antibody and the beta-lactoglobulin allergen,"Allergies are caused by the immune reaction to commonly harmless proteins, allergens. This reaction is typified by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. We report the crystal structure of an IgE Fab fragment in complex with beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), one of the major allergens of bovine milk. The solved structure shows how two IgE/Fab molecules bind the dimeric BLG. The epitope of BLG consists of six different short fragments of the polypeptide chain, which are located especially in the beta strands, covering a flat area on the allergen surface. All six CDR (complementary-determining region) loops of the IgE Fab participate in the binding of BLG. The light chain CDR loops are responsible for the binding of the flat beta sheet region of BLG. The IgE epitope is different from common IgG epitopes that are normally located in the exposed loop regions of antigens and observed also in the two recently determined allergen-IgG complexes.",0
11889214,SHOX nullizygosity and haploinsufficiency in a Japanese family: implication for the development of Turner skeletal features,"We report on clinical and molecular findings in a Japanese family consisting of a male infant with SHOX nullizygosity and his four family members with SHOX haploinsufficiency. The male infant had Langer mesomelic dysplasia, the prepubertal sister had idiopathic short stature phenotype with no discernible skeletal features, the father had mild Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWDC), and the mother and the maternal grandmother had moderate LWDC. The five subjects lacked clinically recognizable short metacarpals, cubitus valgus, high arched palate, short neck, and micrognathia, as well as recurrent otitis media and hearing loss. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and sequence analyses showed that the proband had a pseudoautosomal microdeletion involving SHOX and a C502T missense mutation in the homeobox domain at exon 4, and that the father was heterozygous for the SHOX deletion, and the sister, the mother, and the grandmother were heterozygous for the C502T mutation. The results, in conjunction with the previous findings, suggest that mesomelic skeletal features such as Langer mesomelic dysplasia and LWDC, which are absent or rare in Turner syndrome, are primarily caused by the SHOX dosage effect and the bone maturing effect of gonadal estrogens, whereas other skeletal features such as short metacarpals, cubitus valgus, and various craniofacial and cervical skeletal stigmata, which are common in Turner syndrome, are largely contributed by a compressive effect of distended lymphatics and lymphedema on the developing skeletal tissues.",0
10221740,Intent-to-treat analysis for longitudinal clinical trials: coping with the challenge of missing values,"Drop-out is a common phenomenon in clinical trials of drug treatments involving longitudinal assessments for a fixed duration of follow-up. For these trials intent-to-treat (IT) analysis is usually preferred because time effects are seen in practice. The IT analysis mandates that all subjects randomized to a treatment arm should be included in the analysis. The purpose of the present paper is to acquaint both clinicians and statisticians with recent statistical methodological advances in handling drop-outs and their usage for IT analysis. We discuss a sensitivity analysis of 12-month outcome data to investigate the efficacy of drug therapy from a longitudinal double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in the maintenance therapy of geriatric major depressive illness. Outcome measures consist of monthly Hamilton depression scores. The sensitivity analysis includes endpoint analysis, last observation carried forward analysis, repeated measures models and imputation models. Imputation models are based on multiple imputations of missing responses deriving from an 'as-treated' model. The model used imputed doses from a plausible treatment scenario after drop-out and a 'propensity-adjusted' model where the imputations for the drop-outs were obtained from the adhering subjects with the same probability to remain on study (propensity) given the observed trajectory prior to withdrawal. Issues related to bias and efficiency of the estimates obtained by different analyses are discussed. We recommend a more widespread use of imputation models for the IT analysis.",0
14574034,A review of clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of newer antiarrhythmic drugs in atrial fibrillation,"Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of anti- arrhythmic drugs for terminating atrial fibrillation have demonstrated that rate control drugs have little to no added efficacy compared to placebo; however, spontaneous conversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation is common. Antiarrhythmic drugs such as oral dofetilide, oral bolus-flecainide and propafenone and intravenous ibutilide all have a role in terminating atrial fibrillation. Active comparator trials have demonstrated that amiodarone is more efficacious in maintaining sinus rhythm than propafenone and sotalol. Multiple trials have demonstrated the safety of amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide and azimilide in a post-myocardial infarction population and amiodarone and dofetilide in a congestive heart failure population. Newer antiarrhythmic agents, some with novel mechanisms of action, will add to the pharmacologic armamentarium in treating atrial fibrillation.",0
18854872,Identification of two new mutations in the GPR98 and the PDE6B genes segregating in a Tunisian family,"Autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (ARRP) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. ARRP could be associated with extraocular manifestations that define specific syndromes such as Usher syndrome (USH) characterized by retinal degeneration and congenital hearing loss (HL). The USH type II (USH2) associates RP and mild-to-moderate HL with preserved vestibular function. At least three genes USH2A, the very large G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR98, and DFNB31 are responsible for USH2 syndrome. Here, we report on the segregation of non-syndromic ARRP and USH2 syndrome in a consanguineous Tunisian family, which was previously used to define USH2B locus. With regard to the co-occurrence of these two different pathologies, clinical and genetic reanalysis of the extended family showed (i) phenotypic heterogeneity within USH2 patients and (ii) excluded linkage to USH2B locus. Indeed, linkage analysis disclosed the cosegregation of the USH2 phenotype with the USH2C locus markers, D5S428 and D5S618, whereas the ARRP perfectly segregates with PDE6B flanking markers D4S3360 and D4S2930. Molecular analysis revealed two new missense mutations, p.Y6044C and p.W807R, occurring in GPR98 and PDE6B genes, respectively. In conclusion, our results show that the USH2B locus at chromosome 3p23-24.2 does not exist, and we therefore withdraw this locus designation. The combination of molecular findings for GPR98 and PDE6B genes enable us to explain the phenotypic heterogeneity and particularly the severe ocular affection first observed in one USH2 patient. This report presents an illustration of how consanguinity could increase familial clustering of multiple hereditary diseases within the same family.",1
11349946,Differentiation and quantitation of isomeric dipeptides by low-energy dissociation of copper(II)-bound complexes,"Application of the kinetic method based on the dissociation of transition metal centered cluster ions is extended from chiral analysis (Tao, W. A.; Zhang, D.; Nikolaev, E. N.; Cooks, R. G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 122, 10598) to quantitative analysis of isomeric mixtures, including those with Leu/Ile substitutions. Copper(II)-bound complexes of pairs of peptide isomers are generated by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and the trimeric complex [CuII(ref)2(A) - H]+ (analyte A, a mixture of isomeric peptides; reference compound ref, usually a peptide) is caused to undergo collisional dissociation. Competitive loss of the neutral reference compound or the neutral analyte yields two ionic products and the ratio of rates of the two competitive dissociations, viz. the product ion branching ratio R is shown to depend strongly on the regiochemistry of the analyte in the precursor [CuII(A)(ref)2 - H]+ complex ion. Calibration curves are constructed by relating the branching ratio measured by the kinetic method, to the isomeric composition of the mixture to allow rapid quantitative isomer analysis.",0
15238223,Human ATP-binding cassette transporter-2 (ABCA2) positively regulates low-density lipoprotein receptor expression and negatively regulates cholesterol esterification in Chinese hamster ovary cells,"We present evidence that the ATP binding-cassette transporter-2 (ABCA2) is a sterol-responsive gene that has a role in the trafficking of low-density lipoprotein-derived free cholesterol (LDL-FC). In HepG2 cells ABCA2 was coordinately expressed with other sterol-responsive genes. Stable constitutive expression of ABCA2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOA2) was accompanied by an increase the expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and other genes involved in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. LDLR mRNA was elevated greater than ninefold and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase (HMGCoA S) expression was elevated sevenfold in CHOA2 cells. The increase in LDLR expression was regulated at the level of transcription; however, culture of CHO and CHOA2 cells in medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) results in similar levels of LDLR promoter expression. No differences were measured in the dose-dependent uptake of fluorescently labeled 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchorate-LDL (DiI-LDL) between CHO and CHOA2 cells cultured in medium containing LPDS. Ultraviolet microscopy revealed a similar distribution of the DiI-LDL label in cytoplasmic vesicles. We measured an LDL dose-dependent reduction in esterification of LDL-FC in intact CHOA2 cells cultured in medium containing LPDS, however, no significant difference was measured in acylcoenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity in cell-free extracts of CHO and CHOA2 cells. CHO cells or CHOA2 cells treated with the hydrophobic amine, U18666A, showed similar filipin staining of unesterified cholesterol in cytoplasmic vesicles. Addition of progesterone or U18666A to CHO cells elevated ABCA2 expression. Finally, we found that ABCA2 expression was elevated in Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) fibroblasts and in Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FHC) fibroblasts.",1
3093854,Hypersensitivity of Drosophila mei-41 mutants to hydroxyurea is associated with reduced mitotic chromosome stability,"6 mutant alleles of the mei-41 locus in Drosophila melanogaster are shown to cause hypersensitivity to hydroxyurea in larvae. The strength of that sensitivity is directly correlated with the influence of the mutant alleles on meiosis in that: alleles exhibiting a strong meiotic effect (mei-41D2, mei-41D5, mei-41D7) are highly sensitive; alleles with negligible meiotic effects (mei-41(104)D1, mei-41(104)D2) are moderately sensitive and an allele which expresses meiotic effects only under restricted conditions (mei-41D9) has an intermediate sensitivity. This sensitivity is not a general feature of strong postreplication repair-deficient mutants, because mutants with that phenotype from other loci do not exhibit sensitivity (mus(2)205A1, mus(3)302D1, mus(3)310D1). The observed lethality is not due to hypersensitivity of DNA synthesis in mei-41 larvae to hydroxyurea as assayed by tritiated thymidine incorporation. Lethality is, however, potentially attributable to an abnormal enhancement of chromosomal aberrations by hydroxyurea in mutant mei-41 larvae. Both in vivo and in vitro exposure of neuroblast cells to hydroxyurea results in an increase in 3 types of aberrations which is several fold higher in mei-41 tissue. Since hydroxyurea disrupts DNA synthesis, these results further implicate the mei-41 locus in DNA metabolism and provide an additional tool for an elucidation of its function. The possible existence of additional genes of this nature is suggested by a more modest sensitivity to hydroxyurea which has been detected in two stocks carrying mutagen-sensitive alleles of alternate genes.",1
30773139,Oral administration of antibiotics increased the potential mobility of bacterial resistance genes in the gut of the fish Piaractus mesopotamicus,"BACKGROUND: Aquaculture is on the rise worldwide, and the use of antibiotics is fostering higher production intensity. However, recent findings suggest that the use of antibiotics comes at the price of increased antibiotic resistance. Yet, the effect of the oral administration of antibiotics on the mobility of microbial resistance genes in the fish gut is not well understood. In the present study, Piaractus mesopotamicus was used as a model to evaluate the effect of the antimicrobial florfenicol on the diversity of the gut microbiome as well as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) using a metagenomic approach. RESULTS: The total relative abundance of ARGs and MGEs significantly increased during the antibiotic exposure. Additionally, phage integrases, transposases, and transposons flanking ARGs accumulated in the gut microbiome of P. mesopotamicus because of the antibiotic exposure. MGEs co-occurring with ARGs showed a significant positive correlation with the total ARGs found. Furthermore, shifts in the gut microbiome towards well-known putative pathogens such as Salmonella, Plesiomonas, and Citrobacter were observed following florfenicol treatment. Mainly Plesiomonas and Citrobacter harbored genes that code for multidrug and phenicol efflux pumps. Moreover, several genes related to RNA processing and modification, cell motility, SOS response, and extracellular structure were enriched due to the antibiotic application. The observed effects were visible during the complete application phase and disappeared at the post-exposure phase. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the oral administration of antibiotics increases the potential for MGE-mediated exchange of ARGs in the gut of fish and could contribute to the enrichment and dispersion of ARGs in aquaculture systems. Importantly, this increase in the potential for ARGs exchange could be an effect of changes in community structure and/or ARG mobilization.",0
10639438,Enzymatic properties of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV produced by the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis and its participation in virulence,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogen associated with adult periodontitis. We cloned and sequenced the gene (dpp) coding for dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPPIV) from P. gingivalis W83, based on the amino acid sequences of peptide fragments derived from purified DPPIV. An Escherichia coli strain overproducing P. gingivalis DPPIV was constructed. The enzymatic properties of recombinant DPPIV purified from the overproducer were similar to those of DPPIV isolated from P. gingivalis. The three amino acid residues Ser, Asp, and His, which are thought to form a catalytic triad in the C-terminal catalytic domain of eukaryotic DPPIV, are conserved in P. gingivalis DPPIV. When each of the corresponding residues of the enzyme was substituted with Ala by site-directed mutagenesis, DPPIV activity significantly decreased, suggesting that these three residues of P. gingivalis DPPIV are involved in the catalytic reaction. DPPIV-deficient mutants of P. gingivalis were constructed and subjected to animal experiments. Mice injected with the wild-type strain developed abscesses to a greater extent and died more frequently than those challenged with mutant strains. Mice injected with the mutants exhibited faster recovery from the infection, as assessed by weight gain and the rate of lesion healing. This decreased virulence of mutants compared with the parent strain suggests that DPPIV is a potential virulence factor of P. gingivalis and may play important roles in the pathogenesis of adult periodontitis induced by the organism.",0
20696173,Hydrodynamic interaction of two unsteady model microorganisms,"The study of pair-wise interactions between swimming microorganisms is fundamental to the understanding of the rheological and transport properties of semi-dilute suspensions. In this paper, the hydrodynamic interaction of two ciliated microorganisms is investigated numerically using a boundary-element method, and the microorganisms are modeled as spherical squirmers that swim by time-dependent surface deformations. The results show that the inclusion of the unsteady terms in the ciliary propulsion model has a large impact on the trajectories of the interacting cells, and causes a significant change in scattering angles with potential important consequences on the diffusion properties of semi-dilute suspensions. Furthermore, the analysis of the shear stress acting on the surface of the microorganisms revealed that the duration and the intensity of the near-field interaction are significantly modified by the presence of unsteadiness. This observation may account for the hydrodynamic nature of randomness in some biological reactions, and supersedes the distinction between intrinsic randomness and hydrodynamic interactions, adding a further element to the understanding and modeling of interacting microorganisms.",0
15699345,Impaired vasodilation by red blood cells in sickle cell disease,"Red blood cells (RBCs) have been ascribed a unique role in dilating blood vessels, which requires O2-regulated binding and bioactivation of NO by Hb and transfer of NO equivalents to the RBC membrane. Vasoocclusion in hypoxic tissues is the hallmark of sickle cell anemia. Here we show that sickle cell Hb variant S (HbS) is deficient both in the intramolecular transfer of NO from heme iron (iron nitrosyl, FeNO) to cysteine thiol (S-nitrosothiol, SNO) that subserves bioactivation, and in transfer of the NO moiety from S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-HbS) to the RBC membrane. As a result, sickle RBCs are deficient in membrane SNO and impaired in their ability to mediate hypoxic vasodilation. Further, the magnitudes of these impairments correlate with the clinical severity of disease. Thus, our results suggest that abnormal RBC vasoactivity contributes to the vasoocclusive pathophysiology of sickle cell anemia, and that the phenotypic variation in expression of the sickle genotype may be explained, in part, by variable deficiency in RBC processing of NO. More generally, our findings raise the idea that defective NO processing may characterize a new class of hemoglobinopathy.",0
3377935,Apnoea associated with the intrathecal administration of morphine in obstetrics. A case report,"The intrathecal administration of hyperbaric morphine 1 mg for pain relief during labour was followed, 7 h after injection, and 1 h after delivery, by respiratory depression. Pulseoximetry was helpful in alerting the medical personnel. After an initial 1 mg of naloxone i.v. in increments of 0.1-0.2 mg, a continuous infusion of naloxone 0.4 mg h-1 i.v. was used to prevent a recurrence of the respiratory depression. The total dose of naloxone over an 8-h period was 3.6 mg.",0
9827529,"Characterization of MOAT-C and MOAT-D, new members of the MRP/cMOAT subfamily of transporter proteins","BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) and canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT) are transporter proteins that pump organic anions across cellular membranes and have been linked to resistance to cytotoxic drugs. We previously identified MOAT-B, an MRP/cMOAT-related transporter, by use of a polymerase chain reaction approach. However, analysis of expressed sequence tag (EST) databases indicated that there might be additional MRP/cMOAT-related transporters. To further define the MRP/cMOAT subfamily of transporters, we used EST probes to isolate complementary DNAs for two related transporter proteins, MOAT-C and MOAT-D. METHODS: MOAT-C and MOAT-D expression patterns in human tissues were determined by RNA blot analysis, and chromosomal localization of the genes was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: MOAT-C is predicted to encode a 1437-amino-acid protein that, among eukaryotic transporters, is most closely related to MRP, cMOAT, and MOAT-B (about 36% identity). However, MOAT-C is less related to MRP and cMOAT than MRP and cMOAT are to each other (about 48% identity). Like MOAT-B, MOAT-C lacks an N-terminal membrane-spanning domain, indicating that the topology of this protein is similarly distinct from that of MRP and cMOAT. MOAT-D is predicted to encode a 1527-amino-acid protein that is the closest known relative of MRP (about 58% identity). MOAT-D is also highly related to cMOAT (about 47% identity). The presence of an N-terminal membrane-spanning domain indicates that the topology of MOAT-D is quite similar to that of MRP and cMOAT. MOAT-C transcripts are widely expressed in human tissues; however, MOAT-D transcript expression is more restricted. The MOAT-C and MOAT-D genes are located at chromosomes 3q27 and 17q21.3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of amino acid identity and protein topology, the MRP/cMOAT transporter subfamily falls into two groups; the first group consists of MRP, cMOAT, and MOAT-D, and the second group consists of MOAT-B and MOAT-C.",1
1824668,Use of short sequence repeat DNA polymorphisms after PCR amplification to detect the parental origin of the additional chromosome 21 in Down syndrome,"The origin of nondisjunction in trisomy 21 has so far been studied using cytogenetic heteromorphisms and DNA polymorphisms using Southern blot analysis. Short sequence repeats have recently been described as an abundant class of DNA polymorphisms in the human genome, which can be typed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. We describe the usage of such markers on chromosome 21 in the study of parental origin of the additional chromosome 21 in 87 cases of Down syndrome. The polymorphisms studied were (a) two (GT)n repeats and a poly(A) tract of an Alu sequence within the HMG14 gene and (b) a (GT)n repeat of locus D21S156. The parental origin was determined in 68 cases by studying the segregation of polymorphic alleles in the nuclear families (either by scoring three different alleles in the proband or by dosage comparison of two different alleles in the proband). Our results demonstrate the usefulness of highly informative PCR markers for the study of nondisjunction in Down syndrome.",0
18060579,Effects of chlorpyrifos on macroinvertebrate communities in coastal stream mesocosms,"This study measured the effects of a single pulse of chlorpyrifos at nominal concentrations of 1 and 10 microg/l on the macroinvertebrate community structure of a coastal stream mesocosm system. Analysis of data using Principal Response Curves (PRC) and Monte Carlo tests showed significant changes in the treated stream mesocosms relative to that of the controls. These changes in the macroinvertebrate assemblages occurred within 6 h, and persisted for at least 124 days after dosing. Significant community-level effects were detected at the lowest concentration on days 2 and 16 post-dosing, giving a no-observed effect concentration (NOEC(community)) of 1.2 microg/l (measured). The mayflies Atalophlebia sp. and Koorrnonga sp., Chironomidae and Acarina were all sensitive to chlorpyrifos and decreased in abundance in treated mesocosms after dosing. The fauna of these coastal stream mesocosms showed similar sensitivity to chlorpyrifos with that of other reported studies, but there was no evidence of recovery after 124 days.",0
17676051,Increased serine protease activity and cathelicidin promotes skin inflammation in rosacea,"Acne rosacea is an inflammatory skin disease that affects 3% of the US population over 30 years of age and is characterized by erythema, papulopustules and telangiectasia. The etiology of this disorder is unknown, although symptoms are exacerbated by factors that trigger innate immune responses, such as the release of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides. Here we show that individuals with rosacea express abnormally high levels of cathelicidin in their facial skin and that the proteolytically processed forms of cathelicidin peptides found in rosacea are different from those present in normal individuals. These cathelicidin peptides are a result of a post-translational processing abnormality associated with an increase in stratum corneum tryptic enzyme (SCTE) in the epidermis. In mice, injection of the cathelicidin peptides found in rosacea, addition of SCTE, and increasing protease activity by targeted deletion of the serine protease inhibitor gene Spink5 each increases inflammation in mouse skin. The role of cathelicidin in enabling SCTE-mediated inflammation is verified in mice with a targeted deletion of Camp, the gene encoding cathelicidin. These findings confirm the role of cathelicidin in skin inflammatory responses and suggest an explanation for the pathogenesis of rosacea by demonstrating that an exacerbated innate immune response can reproduce elements of this disease.",1
11061257,Rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism: a clinical and genetic analysis of a new kindred,"BACKGROUND: Rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP) is an autosomal dominant disorder linked to chromosome 19q13 that is characterized by sudden onset of primarily bulbar and upper limb dystonia with parkinsonism. METHODS: The authors evaluated 12 individuals from three generations of an Irish family and obtained detailed medical records on a deceased member. The authors describe the clinical, psychiatric, and genetic features of the affected individuals. RESULTS: Five of eight affected members developed sudden-onset (several hours to days) dystonia with postural instability. Four of the five also had bulbar symptoms. Two have stable focal or segmental limb dystonia. One has intermittent hemidystonia with dysarthria that comes on abruptly in times of stress or anxiety. Three had a history of profound difficulty socializing, and at presentation two developed depression. Three patients had a trial of dopamine agonists without benefit. Genetic analysis suggests linkage to chromosome 19 with lod score of 2.1 at zero recombination. CONCLUSION: This is the third reported family with chromosome 19q13 rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism. Psychiatric morbidity appeared common in affected members of this family and may be part of the RDP phenotype.",1
9150155,Study of a single BRCA2 mutation with high carrier frequency in a small population,"Germ-line changes in the cancer-predisposition gene BRCA2 are found in a small proportion of breast cancers. Mutations in the BRCA2 gene have been studied mainly in families with high risk of breast cancer in females, and male breast cancer also has been associated with BRCA2 mutations. The importance of germ-line BRCA2 mutations in individuals without a family history of breast cancer is unknown. The same BRCA2 mutation has been found in 16/21 Icelandic breast cancer families, indicating a founder effect. We determined the frequency of this mutation, 999del5, in 1,182 Icelanders, comprising 520 randomly selected individuals from the population and a series of 632 female breast cancer patients (61.4% of patients diagnosed during the study period) and all male breast cancer patients diagnosed during the past 40 years. We detected the 999del5 germ-line mutation in 0.6% of the population, in 7.7% of female breast cancer patients, and in 40% of males with breast cancer. The mutation was strongly associated with onset of female breast cancer at age <50 years, but its penetrance and expression are varied. A number of cancers other than breast cancer were found to be increased in relatives of mutation carriers, including those with prostate and pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, germ-line BRCA2 mutation can be present without a strong family history of breast cancer. Comparison of the age at onset for mother/daughter pairs with the 999del5 mutation and breast cancer indicates that age at onset is decreasing in the younger generation. Increase in breast cancer incidence and lower age at onset suggest a possible contributing environmental factor.",1
8690922,Molecular bases for inherited human complement component C6 deficiency in two unrelated individuals,"Deficiency of the sixth component of complement (C6D) is frequently associated with recurrent neisserial infections, especially meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis. We here report the molecular bases of C6D in two unrelated subjects, one African American (case 1) and the other Japanese (case 2). Screening all 17 exons of the C6 gene and their boundaries by exon-specific PCR/single strand conformation polymorphism demonstrated aberrant single stranded DNA fragments in exon 12 of case 1 and exon 2 of case 2. Nucleotide sequencing of the amplified DNA fragments revealed a homozygous single-base deletion (G1936) in exon 12 case 1 and a heterozygous single base deletion (C291/C292/C293/C294) in exon 2 of case 2. Both mutations resulted in frame shifts and premature termination of the C6 polypeptide. Sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization and direct sequencing of exon 12 amplified from genomic DNA further supported the homozygosity of the mutation in case 1. Case 2 is apparently compound heterozygote, but the putative mutation in the other allele of the C6 gene remains unknown. Both case 1 and case 2 were homozygous for the C6A allotype. These data indicate that at least three distinct mutational events can cause C6D, single nucleotide deletions in exons 2 and 12, and a mutation yet unidentified. Thus, similar to other complement protein deficiencies, the pathogenesis of C6D appears to be heterogeneous.",1
16160464,A toxicity index of skin and wound cleansers used on in vitro fibroblasts and keratinocytes,"OBJECTIVE: To determine toxicity indexes of commercially available skin, wound, and skin/wound cleansers on in vitro fibroblasts and keratinocytes. DESIGN: Seventeen cleansers and 3 liquid bath soaps were evaluated for cytotoxic effect on human infant dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes. Both skin cell types were exposed to serial 10-fold dilutions of each cleanser until treated cell viability was comparable to untreated controls. RESULTS: The experimental design allowed calculation of relative toxicity indexes ranging from 0 to 100,000. Shur-Clens, SAF-Clens, and saline were found to be the least toxic to fibroblasts (toxicity index 0); Dial Antibacterial Soap and Ivory Liqui-Gel were the most toxic (toxicity index 100,000). Biolex, Shur-Clens, and Techni-Care were the least toxic to keratinocytes (toxicity index 0); hydrogen peroxide, modified Dakin's solution, and povidone (10%) were found to be the most toxic (toxicity index 100,000). CONCLUSIONS: Successful cutaneous tissue repair depends on the viability of the principal cell types involved (fibroblasts and keratinocytes). Toxicity indexes provide helpful guidelines for subsequent in vivo evaluations and clinical applications. The study findings also suggest that judicious use of these supposedly innocuous agents should be considered in a clinical setting.",0
12732850,Humanin peptide suppresses apoptosis by interfering with Bax activation,"Bax (Bcl2-associated X protein) is an apoptosis-inducing protein that participates in cell death during normal development and in various diseases. Bax resides in an inactive state in the cytosol of many cells. In response to death stimuli, Bax protein undergoes conformational changes that expose membrane-targeting domains, resulting in its translocation to mitochondrial membranes, where Bax inserts and causes release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic proteins. It is unknown what controls conversion of Bax from the inactive to active conformation. Here we show that Bax interacts with humanin (HN), an anti-apoptotic peptide of 24 amino acids encoded in mammalian genomes. HN prevents the translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria. Conversely, reducing HN expression by small interfering RNAs sensitizes cells to Bax and increases Bax translocation to membranes. HN peptides also block Bax association with isolated mitochondria, and suppress cytochrome c release in vitro. Notably, the mitochondrial genome contains an identical open reading frame, and the mitochondrial version of HN can also bind and suppress Bax. We speculate therefore that HN arose from mitochondria and transferred to the nuclear genome, providing a mechanism for protecting these organelles from Bax.",1
8786135,"Comparative genome mapping of the ataxia-telangiectasia region in mouse, rat, and Syrian hamster","Chromosomal locations of the Atm (ataxia-telangiectasia (AT)-mutated) and Acat1 (mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase) genes in mouse, rat, and Syrian hamster were determined by direct R-banding FISH. Both genes were colocalized to the C-D band of mouse chromosome 9, the proximal end of q24.1 of rat chromosome 8, and qa4-qa5 of Syrian hamster chromosome 12. The regions in the mouse and rat were homologous to human chromosome 11q. Fine genetic linkage mapping of the mouse AT region was performed using the interspecific backcross mice. Atm, Acat1, and Npat, which is a new gene isolated from the AT region, and 12 flanking microsatellite DNA markers were examined. No recombinations were found among the Atm, Npat, Acat1, and D9Mit6 loci, and these loci were mapped 2.0 cM distal to D9Mit99 and 1.3 cM proximal to D9Mit102. Comparison of the linkage map of mouse chromosome 9 (MMU9) and that of human chromosome 11 (HSA11) indicates that there is a chromosomal rearrangement due to an inversion between Ets1 and Atm-Npat-Acat1 and that the inversion of MMU9 originated from the chromosomal breakage at the boundary between Gria4 and Atm-Npat-Acat1 on HSA11. This type of inversion appeared to be conserved in the three rodent species, mouse, rat, and Syrian hamster, using additional comparative mapping data with the Rck gene.",1
30781325,First Report of Sweet potato leaf curl virus in China,"During the 2004 growing season in the Liaoning Province in China, where there was large population of whiteflies, several sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) breeding lines showed leaf curl symptoms. A survey was conducted to determine the incidence of Sweet potato leaf curl virus (SPLCV) in China. Sixteen plants were collected and stem scions from those plants were graft inoculated to Ipomoea nil. Three weeks later, the indicator developed symptoms of leaf curling, interveinal chlorosis, and stunting. Total nucleic acid was extracted from young leaves of sweet potato and then evaluated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers, developed by Briddon and Markham (1) and used as universal primers for amplification of the geminivirus DNA fragment, were BM-V (5'-KSG GGT CGA CGT CAT CAA TGA CGT TRT AC-3') and BM-C (5'-AAR GAA TTC ATK GGG GCC CAR ARR GAC TGG C-3'). Amplified fragments with BM primers theoretically should have sizes almost equal to the full length of the DNA A component of the bipartite genome (2). Expected DNA fragments of 2.8 kb that contained the AV1, AV2, AC1, AC2, AC3, and AC4 open reading frames were obtained from symptomatic, but not from symptomless (uninfected) plants. The 2.8-kb fragments obtained by amplification were purified and cloned into the PMD18-T vector. Recombinant plasmids were then transformed into competent cells of Escherichia coli strain DH5(. The fragment was sequenced (GenBank Accession No. DQ512731), and nucleotide sequence of corresponding regions were compared with a published sequence of SPLCV available in GenBank (Accession No. AF104036). The AC4 and AC2 genes showed the highest (92%) and the lowest (83%) identity, respectively. This virus has been reported in the United States, Taiwan, Japan, and Peru. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the natural occurrence of SPLCV in China. References: (1) R. W. Briddon and P. G. Markham. Mol. Biotechnol. 1:202, 1994. (2) M. Onuki and K. Hanada. Ann.

9052785,Homeosis and intestinal tumours in Cdx2 mutant mice,"In Drosophila, disturbing the expression of the homeobox gene caudal causes a severe disruption in body segmentation and global body patterning. There are three mouse homologues of Drosophila caudal: Cdx1 (ref. 2), Cdx2 (ref. 3) and Cdx4 (ref. 4). We have generated a null mutation of murine Cdx2 by homologous recombination. Cdx2 homozygote null mutants die between 3.5 and 5.5 days post coitum (d.p.c.). Cdx2 heterozygote mutants exhibit a variable phenotype, with many showing tail abnormalities or stunted growth. Skeletal analysis demonstrates a homeotic shift of vertebrae and compatible malformations of the ribs. Within the first three months of life, 90% of Cdx2 heterozygotes develop multiple intestinal adenomatous polyps, particularly in the proximal colon. These polyps occasionally contain areas of true metaplasia. In contrast to the surrounding intestinal epithelium, the neoplastic cells do not express Cdx2 from the remaining allele. These results suggest that Cdx2 mutation is the primary event in the genesis of some intestinal tumours.",1
33054737,Schema therapy versus cognitive behavioral therapy versus individual supportive therapy for depression in an inpatient and day clinic setting: study protocol of the OPTIMA-RCT,"BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder represents (MDD) a major cause of disability and disease burden. Beside antidepressant medication, psychotherapy is a key approach of treatment. Schema therapy has been shown to be effective in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, especially personality disorders, in a variety of settings and patient groups. Nevertheless, there is no evidence on its effectiveness for MDD in an inpatient nor day clinic setting and little is known about the factors that drive treatment response in such a target group. METHODS: In the current protocol, we outline OPTIMA (OPtimized Treatment Identification at the MAx Planck Institute): a single-center randomized controlled trial of schema therapy as a treatment approach for MDD in an inpatient and day clinic setting. Over the course of 7 weeks, we compare schema therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy and individual supportive therapy, conducted in individual and group sessions and with no restrictions regarding concurrent antidepressant medication, thus approximating real-life treatment conditions. N = 300 depressed patients are included. All study therapists undergo a specific training and supervision and therapy adherence is assessed. Primary outcome is depressive symptom severity as self-assessment (Beck Depression Inventory-II) and secondary outcomes are clinical ratings of MDD (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale), recovery rates after 7 weeks according to the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview, general psychopathology (Brief Symptom Inventory), global functioning (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule), and clinical parameters such as dropout rates. Further parameters on a behavioral, cognitive, psychophysiological, and biological level are measured before, during and after treatment and in 2 follow-up assessments after 6 and 24 months after end of treatment. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, the OPTIMA-Trial is the first to investigate the effectiveness of schema therapy as a treatment approach of MDD, to investigate mechanisms of change, and explore predictors of treatment response in an inpatient and day clinic setting by using such a wide range of parameters. Insights from OPTIMA will allow more integrative approaches of psychotherapy of MDD. Especially, the identification of intervention-specific markers of treatment response can improve evidence-based clinical decision for individualizing treatment.

10359122,Activating interactions in human NK cell recognition: the role of 2B4-CD48,"2B4 is a cell surface glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily structurally related to CD2-like molecules. It was originally identified in the mouse as a receptor that mediates non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity by NK cells and CD8+ T cells. Recently, 2B4 was shown to bind CD48 by molecular binding assays and surface plasmon resonance. Here, we have investigated the cell surface expression, biochemical characteristics and function of human 2B4. Our results show that 2B4 is expressed not only on NK cells and CD8+ T cells, but also on monocytes and basophils, indicating a broader role for 2B4 in leukocyte activation. In NK cells, engagement of 2B4 with a specific monoclonal antibody or with CD48 can trigger NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The contribution of 2B4-CD48 interaction to target cell lysis by different NK cell clones varies, probably dependent on the relative contribution of other receptor-ligand interactions. In T cells and monocytes, ligation of 2B4 does not lead to T cell or monocyte activation. Thus, it appears that the primary function of 2B4 is to modulate other receptor-ligand interactions to enhance leukocyte activation.",1
17200714,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia requires BCL2 to sequester prodeath BIM, explaining sensitivity to BCL2 antagonist ABT-737","Antiapoptotic B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family proteins are expressed in many cancers, but the circumstances under which these proteins are necessary for tumor maintenance are poorly understood. We exploited a novel functional assay that uses BCL2 homology domain 3 (BH3) peptides to predict dependence on antiapoptotic proteins, a strategy we call BH3 profiling. BH3 profiling accurately predicts sensitivity to BCL2 antagonist ABT-737 in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. BH3 profiling also accurately distinguishes myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) from BCL2 dependence in myeloma cell lines. We show that the special sensitivity of CLL cells to BCL2 antagonism arises from the requirement that BCL2 tonically sequester proapoptotic BIM in CLL. ABT-737 displaced BIM from BCL2's BH3-binding pocket, allowing BIM to activate BAX, induce mitochondrial permeabilization, and rapidly commit the CLL cell to death. Our experiments demonstrate that BCL2 expression alone does not dictate sensitivity to ABT-737. Instead, BCL2 complexed to BIM is the critical target for ABT-737 in CLL. An important implication is that in cancer, BCL2 may not effectively buffer chemotherapy death signals if it is already sequestering proapoptotic BH3-only proteins. Indeed, activator BH3-only occupation of BCL2 may prime cancer cells for death, offering a potential explanation for the marked chemosensitivity of certain cancers that express abundant BCL2, such as CLL and follicular lymphoma.",1
9242382,Cloning a novel member of the human interferon-inducible gene family associated with control of tumorigenicity in a model of human melanoma,"Chromosome 6-mediated suppression of tumorigenicity in malignant melanoma cell lines provides a model system to identify genes associated with the reversion of the tumorigenic phenotype. Using subtractive cDNA selection, we recently identified a series of novel genes which are differentially expressed in association with chromosome 6-mediated suppression. We now report the molecular characterization of a novel gene termed AIM2 for (Absent In Melanoma), which represents a 1485 bp cDNA. An open reading frame of 1032 base pairs, corresponding to 344 amino acid residues, is predicted. The predicted protein shares a conserved sequence domain of approximately 200 amino acids with known interferon-inducible genes of both human and mouse. We demonstrate that the AIM2 gene encodes a transcript of approximately 2 kb which is expressed in spleen, small intestine, and peripheral blood leukocytes. In addition, we have localized AIM2 to the long arm of human chromosome 1 (band q22) in a highly conserved region which also contains the known interferon-inducible genes IFI16 and MNDA. We have also demonstrated that, like IFI16 and MNDA, AIM2 is induced in HL60 cells by interferon gamma. Our findings support the existence of a family of genes in this region similar to the well-characterized mouse Ifi200 gene family.",1
11782431,"BOC, an Ig superfamily member, associates with CDO to positively regulate myogenic differentiation","CDO is a cell surface receptor-like protein that positively regulates myogenic differentiation. Reported here is the identification of BOC, which, with CDO, defines a newly recognized subfamily within the immunoglobulin superfamily. cdo and boc are co-expressed in muscle precursors in the developing mouse embryo. Like CDO, BOC accelerates differentiation of cultured myoblast cell lines and participates in a positive feedback loop with the myogenic transcription factor, MyoD. CDO and BOC form complexes in a cis fashion via association of both their ectodomains and their intracellular domains. A soluble fusion protein that contains the entire BOC ectodomain functions similarly to full-length BOC to promote myogenic differentiation, indicating that the intracellular region is dispensable for its activity in this system. Furthermore, a dominant-negative form of CDO inhibits the pro-myogenic effects of soluble BOC, suggesting that BOC is dependent on CDO for its activity. CDO and BOC are proposed to be components of a receptor complex that mediates some of the cell-cell interactions between muscle precursors that are required for myogenesis.",1
20176045,Neural mechanisms of reproduction in females as a predisposing factor for drug addiction,"There is an increasing awareness that adolescent females differ from males in their response to drugs of abuse and consequently in their vulnerability to addiction. One possible component of this vulnerability to drug addiction is the neurobiological impact that reproductive physiology and behaviors have on the mesolimbic dopamine system, a key neural pathway mediating drug addiction. In this review, we examine animal models that address the impact of ovarian cyclicity, sexual affiliation, sexual behavior, and maternal care on the long-term plasticity of the mesolimbic dopamine system. The thesis is that this plasticity in synaptic neurotransmission stemming from an individual's normal life history contributes to the pathological impact of drugs of abuse on the neurobiology of this system. Hormones released during reproductive cycles have only transient effects on these dopamine systems, whereas reproductive behaviors produce a persistent sensitization of dopamine release and post-synaptic neuronal responsiveness. Puberty itself may not represent a neurobiological risk factor for drug abuse, but attendant behavioral experiences may have a negative impact on females engaging in drug use.",0
9185636,Comparison of one-year efficacy and safety of atorvastatin versus lovastatin in primary hypercholesterolemia. Atorvastatin Study Group I,"This double-blind study to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of atorvastatin was performed in 31 community- and university-based research centers in the USA to directly compare a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (reductase inhibitor) to an accepted drug of this class in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia. Participants remained on a cholesterol-lowering diet throughout the study. One thousand forty-nine patients were randomized to receive atorvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, or placebo. At 16 weeks the placebo group was randomized to either atorvastatin or lovastatin treatment. At 22 weeks, patients who had not met low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol target levels doubled the dose of reductase inhibitor. Efficacy evaluation was mean percent change from baseline in LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apoB). Safety profiles as determined by change from baseline in laboratory evaluations, ophthalmologic parameters, and reporting of adverse events were similar for the 2 reductase inhibitors. After 52 weeks, the atorvastatin group maintained a significantly greater reduction in LDL cholesterol (-37% vs -29%), triglyceride (-16% vs -8%), total cholesterol (-27% vs -21%), and apoB (-30% vs -22%) (p <0.05). More patients receiving atorvastatin achieved LDL cholesterol target levels than did lovastatin patients (78% vs 63%, respectively), particularly those with coronary heart disease (37% vs 11%, respectively). Atorvastatin is highly effective and well tolerated in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia with no increased risk of adverse events.",0
23620778,"Efficacy of Tai Chi on pain, stiffness and function in patients with osteoarthritis: a meta-analysis","BACKGROUND: Whether Tai Chi benefits patients with osteoarthritis remains controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of Tai Chi exercise for pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis. METHODS: A computerized search of PubMed and Embase (up to Sept 2012) was performed to identify relevant studies. The outcome measures were pain, stiffness, and physical function. Two investigators identified eligible studies and extracted data independently. The quality of the included studies was assessed by the Jadad score. Standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and pooled using a random effects model. The change in outcomes from baseline was compared to the minimum clinically important difference. RESULTS: A total of seven randomized controlled trials involving 348 patients with osteoarthritis met the inclusion criteria. The mean Jadad score was 3.6. The pooled SMD was -0.45 (95% CI -0.70--0.20, P = 0.0005) for pain, -0.31 (95% CI -0.60--0.02, P = 0.04) for stiffness, and -0.61 (95% CI -0.85--0.37, P<0.00001) for physical function. A change of 32.2-36.4% in the outcomes was greater than the minimum clinically important difference. CONCLUSIONS: Twelve-week Tai Chi is beneficial for improving arthritic symptoms and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis and should be included in rehabilitation programs. However, the evidence may be limited by potential biases; thus, larger scale randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the current findings and investigate the long-term effects of Tai Chi.",0
10643004,Nail-patella syndrome and IgA nephropathy in a Chinese woman,"Nail-patella syndrome (NPS), also known as hereditary onycho-osteodysplasia, is an autosomal dominant pleiotropic disorder characterized by nailbed dysplasia or hypoplasia, absent or hypoplastic patellae, iliac horns and deformation or luxation of the radial head. Nephropathy is a known serious complication associated with NPS. In this report, we describe an adult Chinese woman with the clinical and radiological features of NPS who presented with the nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsy disclosed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on light microscopy, while immunofluorescence revealed predominant staining for IgA in the glomerular mesangium and along some capillary walls. Ultrastructural study confirmed the presence of paramesangial deposits as well as subendothelial collagen fibrils in the glomeruli. The histological findings were those of combined NPS and IgA disease, an association which has rarely been described.",0
22050797,Effects of preoperative oral beta blocker versus intraoperative nitroprusside or esmolol on quality of surgical field during tympanoplasty,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether orally administered atenolol provides an optimal surgical field in comparison to intravenous sodium nitroprusside or esmolol during tympanoplasty. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blinded study. SETTING: Operating room in a university hospital. PATIENTS: 105 ASA physical status 1 and 2 adult patients undergoing tympanoplasty. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to three groups to receive either oral atenolol 50 mg twice daily for one day prior to surgery (Group I), intraoperative nitroprusside infusion (Group II), or intraoperative esmolol infusion (Group III). MEASUREMENTS: Quality of the operative field, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were assessed. Blood gases, liver enzymes, cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB release, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine concentrations also were measured. MAIN RESULTS: Time to achieve target surgical field was significantly reduced in the atenolol group versus the other groups (8.3 +/- 3.2, 28.2 +/- 6.4, and 17.2 +/- 5.3 min, respectively). Heart rate significantly decreased in the atenolol and esmolol groups versus the nitroprusside group (P < 0.0001). Mean arterial pressure after extubation and frequency of rebound hypertension were comparable in the groups. No significant changes in cardiac enzymes, renal and hepatic function, or acid-base status were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Although the three drugs are acceptable for obtaining an optimum surgical field, preoperative oral beta blocker appeared to be rapid in onset and was simpler to implement.",0
19794125,Alterations of BRAF and HIPK2 loci predominate in sporadic pilocytic astrocytoma,"OBJECTIVE: Independent studies have previously demonstrated that both the HIPK2 and BRAF genes are amplified and rearranged, respectively, in pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs). The purpose of this study was to further investigate the frequency of BRAF and HIPK2 alterations in PAs, the concordance of these events, and their relationship to clinical phenotype. METHODS: We performed extensive characterization by array-based copy number assessment (aCGH), HIPK2 copy number analysis, and BRAF rearrangement and mutation analysis in a set of 79 PAs, including 9 tumors from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). RESULTS: We identified 1 of 3 previously identified BRAF rearrangements in 42/70 sporadic PAs. An additional 2 tumors with no rearrangement also exhibited BRAF mutation, including a novel 3-base insertion. As predicted from the genomic organization at this locus, 22/36 tumors with BRAF rearrangement also exhibited corresponding HIPK2 amplification. However, 14/36 tumors with BRAF rearrangement had no detectable HIPK2 gene amplification and 6/20 tumors demonstrated HIPK2 amplification without apparent BRAF rearrangement or mutation. Only 12/70 PAs lacked detectable BRAF or HIPK2 alterations. Importantly, none of the 9 PA tumors from NF1 patients exhibited BRAF rearrangement or mutation. CONCLUSIONS: BRAF rearrangement represents the most common genetic alteration in sporadic, but not neurofibromatosis type 1-associated, pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs). These findings implicate BRAF in the pathogenesis of these common low-grade astrocytomas in children, and suggest that PAs arise either from NF1 inactivation or BRAF gain of function.",1
15888660,"Functional characterization and neuronal modeling of the effects of childhood absence epilepsy variants of CACNA1H, a T-type calcium channel","Sequencing of the T-type Ca2+ channel gene CACNA1H revealed 12 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were found only in childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) patients. One SNP, G773D, was found in two patients. The present study reports the finding of a third patient with this SNP, as well as analysis of their parents. Because of the role of T-channels in determining the intrinsic firing patterns of neurons involved in absence seizures, it was suggested that these SNPs might alter channel function. The goal of the present study was to test this hypothesis by introducing these polymorphisms into a human Ca(v)3.2a cDNA and then study alterations in channel behavior using whole-cell patch-clamp recording. Eleven SNPs altered some aspect of channel gating. Computer simulations predict that seven of the SNPs would increase firing of neurons, with three of them inducing oscillations at similar frequencies, as observed during absence seizures. Three SNPs were predicted to decrease firing. Some CAE-specific SNPs (e.g., G773D) coexist with SNPs also found in controls (R788C); therefore, the effect of these polymorphisms were studied. The R788C SNP altered activity in a manner that would also lead to enhanced burst firing of neurons. The G773D-R788C combination displayed different behavior than either single SNP. Therefore, common polymorphisms can alter the effect of CAE-specific SNPs, highlighting the importance of sequence background. These results suggest that CACNA1H is a susceptibility gene that contributes to the development of polygenic disorders characterized by thalamocortical dysrhythmia, such as CAE.",1
24548186,Trophoblasts and decidual stromal cells regulate decidual NK cell functions via interaction between collagen and LAIR-1,"PROBLEM: To determine the effect of collagen from maternal-fetal interface on decidual natural killer cell (dNK) function. METHOD OF STUDY: Decidual and villous samples were collected from normal pregnancy and miscarriage. The phenotype and cytokine production were analyzed, respectively, by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Co-culture was established to investigate the effect of trophoblasts and decidual stromal cells (DSCs) on dNKs. RESULTS: Maternal-fetal interface of normal pregnancy showed higher collagen and LAIR-1 expression than that of miscarriage. Co-culture of dNKs with HTR-8/DSCs up-regulated LAIR-1 on dNKs that could be attenuated by pre-treatment with LAIR-2, a competitive inhibitor of LAIR-1. Collagen down-regulated expression of cell surface receptor activity and intracellular perforin, while it up-regulated expression of suppressive receptor on dNKs. Co-culture of dNKs with HTR-8/DSCs decreased perforin expression and Th1-type cytokines production by dNKs, which could be abrogated by LAIR-2. In addition, silence of collagen in HTR-8/DSCs by shRNA significantly attenuated regulation on dNKs. CONCLUSION: Trophoblasts and DSCs regulate decidual NK cell functions via secreting collagen, which is involved in the maintenance of human pregnancy.",0
19407118,Reduced efficacy of pyrethroid space sprays for dengue control in an area of Martinique with pyrethroid resistance,"In the Caribbean, insecticide resistance is widely developed in Aedes aegypti and represents a serious obstacle for dengue vector control. The efficacy of pyrethroid and organophosphate ultra-low volume space sprays was investigated in Martinique where Ae. aegypti has been shown to be resistant to conventional insecticides. In the laboratory, a wild-field caught population showed high levels of resistance to deltamethrin, organophosphate (naled), and pyrethrum. Simulated-field trials showed that this resistance can strongly reduce the knock-down effect and mortality of deltamethrin and synergized pyrethrins when applied by thermal-fogging. Conversely, the efficacy of naled was high against insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. Chemical analyses of nettings exposed to the treatments showed a decrease in residues over distance from release for the pyrethroids, and naled was not detected. This finding has important implications for dengue vector control and emphasizes the need to develop innovative strategies to maintain effective control of resistant Ae. aegypti populations.",0
20579587,Novel treatment for chylothorax after esophagectomy with 50% glucose pleurodesis,"Chylothorax is characterized by the presence of chyle in the pleural space and cardiothoracic surgery accounts for nearly half of all the cases. Treatment of chylothorax has traditionally been nonoperative, with alternative medical therapies involving the administration of octreotide or pleurodesis. Pleurodesis with chemical agents has previously been reported, but never with 50% glucose and 0.1% xylocaine. Herein, we report a successful method of intrapleural instillation of 50% glucose and 0.1% xylocaine to treat chylothorax. Five patients treated with this method were all recovered rapidly. This method can generate extensive adherence and prevent the effusion of the chylous fluid with minor side effects.",0
23884416,MicroRNA-24 suppression of N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1 (NDST1) reduces endothelial cell responsiveness to vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA),"Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, present at the plasma membrane of vascular endothelial cells, bind to the angiogenic growth factor VEGFA to modulate its signaling through VEGFR2. The interactions between VEGFA and proteoglycan co-receptors require sulfated domains in the HS chains. To date, it is essentially unknown how the formation of sulfated protein-binding domains in HS can be regulated by microRNAs. In the present study, we show that microRNA-24 (miR-24) targets NDST1 to reduce HS sulfation and thereby the binding affinity of HS for VEGFA. Elevated levels of miR-24 also resulted in reduced levels of VEGFR2 and blunted VEGFA signaling. Similarly, suppression of NDST1 using siRNA led to a reduction in VEGFR2 expression. Consequently, not only VEGFA binding, but also VEGFR2 protein expression is dependent on NDST1 function. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-24, or siRNA-mediated reduction of NDST1, reduced endothelial cell chemotaxis in response to VEGFA. These findings establish NDST1 as a target of miR-24 and demonstrate how such NDST1 suppression in endothelial cells results in reduced responsiveness to VEGFA. ",0
11549093,Evaluation of antibiotics for treatment of cattle infected with Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar hardjo,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate antibiotics for treatment of cattle with leptospirosis caused by Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar hardjo. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. ANIMALS: 42 healthy mixed-breed cattle. PROCEDURE: Cattle were inoculated via conjunctival instillation with L. borgpetersenii serovar hardjo. After infection and urinary shedding of L. borgpetersenii were confirmed, cattle were treated with various antibiotics. To determine effectiveness of antibiotic treatment, urinary shedding of L. borgpetersenii was monitored for 4 to 6 weeks after administration of antibiotics, using darkfield microscopic examination, microbial culture, immunofluorescence testing, and a polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: All inoculated cattle developed leptospirosis and shed leptospires in their urine. The following antibiotic treatments resulted in elimination of urinary shedding of leptospires: a single injection of oxytetracycline (20 mg/kg 19 mg/lb] of body weight, IM), tilmicosin (10 mg/kg [4.5 mg/lb], SC), or a combination product that contained dihydrostreptomycin-penicillin G (25 mg/kg [11.4 mg/lb], IM) or multiple injections of ceftiofur sodium (2.2 or 5 mg/kg [1 or 2.3 mg/lb], IM, once daily for 5 days, or 20 mg/kg, IM, once daily for 3 days). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Successful resolution of leptospirosis in cattle by administration of dihydrostreptomycin-penicillin G confirms results obtained by other investigators. Three other antibiotics (oxytetracycline, tilmicosin, and ceftiofur) also were effective for resolving leptospirosis and may be useful substitutes for dihydrostreptomycin, an antibiotic that is no longer available for use in food-producing animals in the United States. Cost, safety, and withdrawal times of these various treatment options need to be considered.",0
18051825,Food challenges in children with asthma,"UNLABELLED: Food-induced symptoms are often reported and increasing problem, also for children with asthma. Evaluation of the possibility of concomitant food allergy in patients with asthma and implementation of adequate therapy can improve quality of life in these patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of IgE food allergy and the influence of food allergen ingestion on the course of asthma in children allergic to inhalant allergens during food challenges. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study performed in 304 children with atopic asthma (age: 5.5-18 years, mean 9.5 +/- 4.69 years) was directed towards the possibility of concomitant food allergy. In each child a detailed questionnaire examination, skin prick tests with food allergens, double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) were performed, and the level of specific IgE was determined (Unicap 100). RESULTS: On the basis of questionnaire data suspicion of food allergy was determined in 164 (66.9%) children. Skin prick tests with food allergens were positive in 36 (21.9%) children. Specific food IgE were detected in 40 (24.4%) children. DBPCFC were performed in 70 children with atopic asthma. IgE-related food allergy was diagnosed in 24 (9.8%) children with asthma. The most frequent complaints during food challenges were gastrointestinal symptoms and exacerbation of atopic eczema; exacerbation of asthma, mainly in the form of cough were determined in 11 (4.5%) children; egg appeared to be the most common food associated with a positive challenge result. CONCLUSIONS: Food allergy more often occurred in children with asthma and concomitant skin and gastrointestinal disorders than in those only with asthma. The diagnosis of possible concomitant food allergy should be considered in children with asthma.",0
3118360,DNA inversion within the apolipoproteins AI/CIII/AIV-encoding gene cluster of certain patients with premature atherosclerosis,"The genes coding for apolipoproteins (apo) AI, CIII, and AIV, designated APOA1, APOC3, and APOA4, respectively, are closely linked and tandemly organized in the long arm of the human chromosome 11. A DNA rearrangement involving the genes encoding apoAI and apoCIII in certain patients with premature atherosclerosis has been associated with deficiency of both apoAI and apoCIII in the plasma of these patients. Structural characterization of the genes for apoAI and apoCIII in one of these patients indicates that this rearrangement consists of a DNA inversion containing portions of the 3' ends of the apoAI and apoCIII genes, including the DNA region between these genes. The breakpoints of this DNA inversion are located within the fourth exon of the apoAI gene and the first intron of the apoCIII gene. Thus, this DNA inversion results in reciprocal fusion of the apoAI and apoCIII gene transcriptional units. Expression of these gene fusions in cultured mammalian cells results in stable mRNA transcripts with sequences representing fusions of the apoAI and apoCIII mRNAs. These results indicate that absence of transcripts with correct apoAI and apoCIII mRNA sequences causes apoAI and apoCIII deficiency in the plasma of these patients and suggest that these apolipoproteins are involved in cholesterol homeostasis and protection against premature atherosclerosis.",1
11553764,The identification of secreted carbonic anhydrase VI as a constitutive glycoprotein of human and rat milk,"In addition to essential nutrients, human milk contains several classes of bioactive factors such as enzymes, hormones, and growth factors, many of which are implicated in infantile growth and development. Secretory carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme VI (CA VI) has been identified earlier as an essential component of mammalian saliva, and we demonstrate here by using biochemical and immunohistochemical techniques that it is also an elementary component of milk. The 42-kDa glycopolypeptide purified from human milk in CA inhibitor affinity chromatography shared 100% homology with salivary CA VI in the protein sequence analysis (40% coverage), and its digestion with PNGase F resulted in a polypeptide backbone similar in size to salivary CA VI. Quantification of CA VI in milk by using a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay revealed an approximately eight-times-higher concentration in human colostrum than in mature milk, the latter corresponding to the levels previously detected in human saliva. The high concentration in the colostrum, in particular its functional and structural stability in an acidic milieu, and its growth-supporting role in the taste buds suggest that milk CA VI is an essential factor in normal growth and development of the infant alimentary tract.",1
10092455,Detection of anticodon nuclease residues involved in tRNALys cleavage specificity,"The tRNALys-specific anticodon nuclease exists in latent form in Escherichia coli strains containing the optional prr locus. The latency is a result of a masking interaction between the anticodon nuclease core-polypeptide PrrC and the Type IC DNA restriction-modification enzyme EcoprrI. Activation of the latent enzyme by phage T4-infection elicits cleavage of tRNALys 5' to the wobble base, yielding 5'-OH and 2', 3'-cyclic phosphate termini. The N-proximal half of PrrC has been implicated with (A/G) TPase and EcoprrI interfacing activities. Therefore, residues involved in recognition and cleavage of tRNALys were searched for at the C-half. Random mutagenesis of the low-G+C portion encoding PrrC residues 200-313 was performed, followed by selection for loss of anticodon nuclease-dependent lethality and production of full-sized PrrC-like protein. This process yielded a cluster of missense mutations mapping to a region highly conserved between PrrC and two putative Neisseria meningitidis MC58 homologues. This cluster included two adjacent members that relaxed the inherent enzyme's cleavage specificity. We also describe another mode of relaxed specificity, due to mere overexpression of PrrC. This mode was shared by wild-type PrrC and the other mutant alleles. The additional substrates recognised under the promiscuous conditions had, in general, anticodons resembling that of tRNALys. Taken together, the data suggest that the anticodon of tRNALys harbours anticodon nuclease identity elements and implicates a conserved region in PrrC in their recognition.",0
16200066,Integrating genotypic and expression data in a segregating mouse population to identify 5-lipoxygenase as a susceptibility gene for obesity and bone traits,"Forward genetic approaches to identify genes involved in complex traits such as common human diseases have met with limited success. Fine mapping of linkage regions and validation of positional candidates are time-consuming and not always successful. Here we detail a hybrid procedure to map loci involved in complex traits that leverages the strengths of forward and reverse genetic approaches. By integrating genotypic and expression data in a segregating mouse population, we show how clusters of expression quantitative trait loci linking to regions of the genome accurately reflect the underlying perturbation to the transcriptional network induced by DNA variations in genes that control the complex traits. By matching patterns of gene expression in a segregating population with expression responses induced by single-gene perturbation experiments, we show how genes controlling clusters of expression and clinical quantitative trait loci can be mapped directly. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by identifying 5-lipoxygenase as underlying previously identified quantitative trait loci in an F(2) cross between strains C57BL/6J and DBA/2J and showing that it has pleiotropic effects on body fat, lipid levels and bone density.",1
27847752,Screw-in forces during instrumentation by various file systems,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the maximum screw-in forces generated during the movement of various Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) file systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty simulated canals in resin blocks were randomly divided into 4 groups for the following instruments: Mtwo size 25/0.07 (MTW, VDW GmbH), Reciproc R25 (RPR, VDW GmbH), ProTaper Universal F2 (PTU, Dentsply Maillefer), and ProTaper Next X2 (PTN, Dentsply Maillefer, n = 10). All the artificial canals were prepared to obtain a standardized lumen by using ProTaper Universal F1. Screw-in forces were measured using a custom-made experimental device (AEndoS-k, DMJ system) during instrumentation with each NiTi file system using the designated movement. The rotation speed was set at 350 rpm with an automatic 4 mm pecking motion at a speed of 1 mm/sec. The pecking depth was increased by 1 mm for each pecking motion until the file reach the working length. Forces were recorded during file movement, and the maximum force was extracted from the data. Maximum screw-in forces were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc comparison at a significance level of 95%. RESULTS: Reciproc and ProTaper Universal files generated the highest maximum screw-in forces among all the instruments while M-two and ProTaper Next showed the lowest (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Geometrical differences rather than shaping motion and alloys may affect the screw-in force during canal instrumentation. To reduce screw-in forces, the use of NiTi files with smaller cross-sectional area for higher flexibility is recommended.",0
32960006,Human inborn errors of immunity caused by defects of receptor and proteins of cellular membrane,"Inborn errors of immunity are diseases of the immune system resulting from mutations that alter the expression of encoded proteins or molecules. Total updated number of these disorders is currently 406, with 430 different identified gene defects involved. Studies of the underlying mechanisms have contributed in better understanding the pathophysiology of the diseases, but also the complexity of the biology of innate and adaptive immune system and its interaction with microbes. In this review we present and briefly discuss Inborn Errors of Immunity caused by defects in genes encoding for receptors and protein of cellular membrane, including cytokine receptors, T cell antigen receptor (TCR) complex, cellular surface receptors or receptors signaling causing predominantly antibody deficiencies, co-stimulatory receptors and others. These alterations impact many biological processes of immune-system cells, including development, proliferation, activation and down-regulation of the immunological response, and result in a variety of diseases that present with distinct clinical features or with overlapping signs and symptoms.",0
20098412,Genome-wide erasure of DNA methylation in mouse primordial germ cells is affected by AID deficiency,"Epigenetic reprogramming including demethylation of DNA occurs in mammalian primordial germ cells (PGCs) and in early embryos, and is important for the erasure of imprints and epimutations, and the return to pluripotency. The extent of this reprogramming and its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We previously showed that the cytidine deaminases AID and APOBEC1 can deaminate 5-methylcytosine in vitro and in Escherichia coli, and in the mouse are expressed in tissues in which demethylation occurs. Here we profiled DNA methylation throughout the genome by unbiased bisulphite next generation sequencing in wild-type and AID-deficient mouse PGCs at embryonic day (E)13.5. Wild-type PGCs revealed marked genome-wide erasure of methylation to a level below that of methylation deficient (Np95(-/-), also called Uhrf1(-/-)) embryonic stem cells, with female PGCs being less methylated than male ones. By contrast, AID-deficient PGCs were up to three times more methylated than wild-type ones; this substantial difference occurred throughout the genome, with introns, intergenic regions and transposons being relatively more methylated than exons. Relative hypermethylation in AID-deficient PGCs was confirmed by analysis of individual loci in the genome. Our results reveal that erasure of DNA methylation in the germ line is a global process, hence limiting the potential for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. AID deficiency interferes with genome-wide erasure of DNA methylation patterns, indicating that AID has a critical function in epigenetic reprogramming and potentially in restricting the inheritance of epimutations in mammals.",1
23575682,A light-driven sodium ion pump in marine bacteria,"Light-driven proton-pumping rhodopsins are widely distributed in many microorganisms. They convert sunlight energy into proton gradients that serve as energy source of the cell. Here we report a new functional class of a microbial rhodopsin, a light-driven sodium ion pump. We discover that the marine flavobacterium Krokinobacter eikastus possesses two rhodopsins, the first, KR1, being a prototypical proton pump, while the second, KR2, pumps sodium ions outward. Rhodopsin KR2 can also pump lithium ions, but converts to a proton pump when presented with potassium chloride or salts of larger cations. These data indicate that KR2 is a compatible sodium ion-proton pump, and spectroscopic analysis showed it binds sodium ions in its extracellular domain. These findings suggest that light-driven sodium pumps may be as important in situ as their proton-pumping counterparts.",0
1563426,Non-absorbable fat-dense oral contrast agent for abdominal computed tomography,"Opacification of the gastrointestinal tract for CT scanning is usually achieved by oral administration of a diluted iodine solution or barium suspension. As high-density contrast agents often cause image degrading artifacts, we investigated the value of a paraffin-methylcellulose emulsion as an oral CT scanning agent. Diseases of the intestinum were clearly outlined with paraffin emulsion, and image degrading artifacts were virtually not encountered.",0
26702991,Randomized non-inferiority trial of Bicalutamide and Dutasteride versus LHRH agonists for prostate volume reduction prior to I-125 permanent implant brachytherapy for prostate cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and toxicity of a 3-month regimen of Dutasteride and Bicalutamide compared to LHRH agonists for prostate volume (PV) reduction prior to permanent implant prostate brachytherapy (PIPB). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with low-risk or low-tier intermediate risk prostate cancer eligible for PIPB with a prostate volume greater than 50 cc were randomized to either Dutasteride 0.5 mg Bicalutamide 50 mg daily and Tamoxifen 10 mg daily for 3 months (D+B group) or to a 3 month dose of an LHRH agonist and Bicalutamide daily for 1 month (LHRH group). Their PV was measured at baseline and at pre-implant. Non-inferiority analysis was completed for the relative (%) PV reduction. IPSS and EPIC questionnaires were completed at baseline, pre-implant and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post-treatment. IPSS and EPIC comparisons were based on superiority analysis RESULTS: 60 patients were randomized (31 to LHRH group and 29 to D+B group). Mean relative PV reduction (SD) was 35.5% (8.9) in the LHRH group and 31.7% (9.6) in the D+B group. The upper bound of the 95% confidence for the interval for the difference between groups favouring LHRH agonists for PV reduction was 8.6 which did not cross the 10% non-inferiority margin meaning D+B is non-inferior to LHRH agonist for PV reduction, although 5/29 (17%) of those in the D+B group required longer duration of D+B to achieve adequate volume reduction. There were no statistically significant differences in IPSS scores over the entire follow-up period. EPIC sexual summary score was significantly better in the D+B group at pre-implant, 1 month, 3 months post-implant. CONCLUSION: Dutasteride and Bicalutamide is a regimen of non-inferior efficacy to LHRH agonist based regimens for prostate volume reduction prior to permanent implant prostate brachytherapy. D+B has less sexual toxicity compared to LHRH agonists prior to implant and for the first 6 months after implant. D+B is therefore an option to be considered for prostate volume reduction prior to PIPB.",0
29915037,RalA controls glucose homeostasis by regulating glucose uptake in brown fat,"Insulin increases glucose uptake into adipose tissue and muscle by increasing trafficking of the glucose transporter Glut4. In cultured adipocytes, the exocytosis of Glut4 relies on activation of the small G protein RalA by insulin, via inhibition of its GTPase activating complex RalGAP. Here, we evaluate the role of RalA in glucose uptake in vivo with specific chemical inhibitors and by generation of mice with adipocyte-specific knockout of RalGAPB. RalA was profoundly activated in brown adipose tissue after feeding, and its inhibition prevented Glut4 exocytosis. RalGAPB knockout mice with diet-induced obesity were protected from the development of metabolic disease due to increased glucose uptake into brown fat. Thus, RalA plays a crucial role in glucose transport in adipose tissue in vivo.",0
21556498,Differential expression of glutathione-s-transferase isozymes in murine and human skin tumors,"Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of widely distributed multifunctional enzymes present in a number of organs and species. GSTs participate in the detoxification of a wide variety of xenobiotics and their metabolites. Mammalian GSTs have been grouped into three major classes alpha, mu and pi. The differential expression of specific GST isozymes has been reported as a phenotypic marker for the preneoplastic lesions and neoplastic tissues in liver and other extracutaneous organs of rat and other species including humans. However, the expression of GST isozymes in skin cancer is not known. In the present study, therefore, employing Western blot analysis, we assessed the GST isozyme expression in experimentally-induced murine skin tumors and clinically obtained human skin basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). As compared to normal murine skin showing high levels of GST-pi, significantly lower expression of GST-pi was observed in murine skin papillomas and carcinomas induced chemically in SENCAR mice or by chronic ultraviolet B radiation in SKH-1 hairless mice. Similar results were also observed for GST-mu isozyme. On the other hand, compared to normal murine skin where the expression of GST-alpha isozyme was not detectable, significant levels of this GST isozyme were observed in all the murine skin papillomas and carcinomas. In case of human skin BCCs and SCCs, variable GST isozyme patterns were evident, however in each case, GST-pi was found to be significantly underexpressed as compared to that in skin from healthy subjects. Our results suggest that altered phenotypic expression of GST isozymes may be a useful marker for skin cancer.",0
7574468,Apolipoprotein E genotypes and age of onset in early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease,"The effect of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 allele on age of onset was analyzed in two groups of families with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), (1) Volga German (VG) kindreds, in which AD is caused by an unknown locus and (2) early-onset non-VG families showing evidence of linkage to chromosome 14. The epsilon 4 allele did not have a detectable effect on age of onset in either group. This finding suggests some forms of early-onset familial AD are not modifiable by APOE status, or that AD can be caused by APOE-independent pathways.",1
29929853,"""""Minimally invasive research?"""" Use of the electronic health record to facilitate research in pediatric urology","BACKGROUND: The electronic health record (EHR) was designed as a clinical and administrative tool to improve clinical patient care. Electronic healthcare systems have been successfully adopted across the world through use of government mandates and incentives. METHODS: Using electronic health record, health information system, electronic medical record, health information systems, research, outcomes, pediatric, surgery, and urology as initial search terms, the literature focusing on clinical documentation data capture and the EHR as a potential resource for research related to clinical outcomes, quality improvement, and comparative effectiveness was reviewed. Relevant articles were supplemented by secondary review of article references as well as seminal articles in the field as identified by the senior author. FINDINGS: US federal funding agencies, including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, the National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration have recognized the EHR's role supporting research. The main approached to using EHR data include enhanced lists, direct data extraction, structured data entry, and unstructured data entry. The EHR's potential to facilitate research, overcoming cost and time burdens associated with traditional data collection, has not resulted in widespread use of EHR-based research tools. CONCLUSION: There are strengths and weaknesses for all existing methodologies of using EHR data to support research. Collaboration is needed to identify the method that best suits the institution for incorporation of research-oriented data collection into routine pediatric urologic clinical practice.",0
15761121,Complement factor H polymorphism and age-related macular degeneration,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common, late-onset, and complex trait with multiple risk factors. Concentrating on a region harboring a locus for AMD on 1q25-31, the ARMD1 locus, we tested single-nucleotide polymorphisms for association with AMD in two independent case-control populations. Significant association (P = 4.95 x 10(-10)) was identified within the regulation of complement activation locus and was centered over a tyrosine-402 --> histidine-402 protein polymorphism in the gene encoding complement factor H. Possession of at least one histidine at amino acid position 402 increased the risk of AMD 2.7-fold and may account for 50% of the attributable risk of AMD.",1

We detected 19 different CFTR mutations located in 9 exons. Eleven of these mutations have not been described previously and nine of them are presented in this study. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis strategy we have used, can be applied to other populations suggesting that population screening for CF on a large scale might be possible.",1
7883971,Familial ligand-defective apolipoprotein B. Identification of a new mutation that decreases LDL receptor binding affinity,"Detection of new ligand-defective mutations of apolipoprotein B (apoB) will enable identification of sequences involved in binding to the LDL receptor. Genomic DNA from patients attending a lipid clinic was screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis for novel mutations in the putative LDL receptor-binding domain of apoB-100. A 46-yr-old woman of Celtic and Native American ancestry with primary hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol [TC] 343 mg/dl; LDL cholesterol [LDL-C] 241 mg/dl) and pronounced peripheral vascular disease was found to be heterozygous for a novel Arg3531-->Cys mutation, caused by a C-->T transition at nucleotide 10800. One unrelated 59-yr-old man of Italian ancestry was found with the same mutation after screening 1,560 individuals. He had coronary heart disease, a TC of 310 mg/dl, and an LDL-C of 212 mg/dl. A total of eight individuals were found with the defect in the families of the two patients. They had an age- and sex-adjusted TC of 240 +/- 14 mg/dl and LDL-C of 169 +/- 10 mg/dl. This compares with eight unaffected family members with age- and sex-adjusted TC of 185 +/- 12 mg/dl and LDL-C of 124 +/- 12 mg/dl. In a dual-label fibroblast binding assay, LDL from the eight subjects with the mutation had an affinity for the LDL receptor that was 63% that of control LDL. LDL from eight unaffected family members had an affinity of 91%. By way of comparison, LDL from six patients heterozygous for the Arg3500-->Gln mutation had an affinity of 36%. The percentage mass ratio of the defective Cys3531 LDL to normal LDL was 59:41, as determined using the mAb MB19 and dynamic laser light scattering. Thus, the defective LDL had accumulated in the plasma of these patients. Using this mass ratio, it was calculated that the defective Cys3531 LDL particles bound with 27% of normal affinity. Deduced haplotypes using 10 apoB gene markers showed the Arg3531-->Cys alleles to be different in the two kindreds and indicates that the mutations arose independently. The Arg3531-->Cys mutation is the second reported cause of familial ligand-defective apoB.",1
23115106,FLT3 mutations in myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia,"FMS-like tyrosine kinase III (FLT3) mutations occur in one-third of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and predict poor outcome. The incidence and impact of FLT3 in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is unknown. We conducted a retrospective review to identify WHO MDS and CMML patients with FLT3 mutations at diagnosis. A total of 2,119 patients with MDS and 466 patients with CMML were evaluated at MD Anderson between 1997 and 2010. Of these, FLT3 mutation analysis was performed on 1,232 (58%) MDS and 302 (65%) CMML patients. FLT3 mutations were identified in 12 (0.95%) MDS patients: 9 (75%) had FLT3-ITD mutation and 3 had FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutation. MDS patients with FLT3 mutations were younger (P = 0.02) and presented as RAEB (P = 0.03) more frequently. Median overall survival (OS) for FLT3-mutated MDS patients was 19.0 months versus 16.4 months for FLT3-nonmutated MDS patients (P = 0.08). FLT3 mutations were identified in 13 (4.3%) CMML patients: 8 had FLT3-ITD mutation and 5 had FLT3-TKD mutation. There were no significant differences in demographic and disease characteristics among CMML patients with and without FLT3 mutations. Median OS for FLT3-mutated CMML patients was 10.8 months versus 21.3 months for FLT3-nonmutated CMML patients (P = 0.12). FLT3 occurs in MDS and CMML at a lower frequency than AML and does not predict poor outcome.",0
29552479,Articulated Bone Block for Posterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Autograft: Surgical Technique to Facilitate Graft Passage,"Posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the transtibial technique provides successful clinical outcomes. However, a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) autograft with the transtibial technique has not been used by some surgeons because of concerns with graft passage from the tibial to the femoral tunnels (sharp turn) that can damage graft fibers. In the present surgical technique, an arthroscopic, transtibial, single-bundle technique for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the BTB autograft with an easy and effective technical tip to facilitate graft passage is presented. Once the BTB is harvested, the femoral bone block is divided into 2 equal-sized blocks providing an articulated structure while preserving the tendon component. This facilitates the passage of the BTB tendon once it is entered in the posterior tibia and the graft has to make a sharp turn to reach the femoral tunnel. This easy and effective technique tip may avoid graft damage during the sharp turn, while maintaining all the advantages of a BTB autograft (bone-to-bone healing, own tissue with fast incorporation, and strong fixation and stability).",0

12881723,Identification of Stk6/STK15 as a candidate low-penetrance tumor-susceptibility gene in mouse and human,Linkage analysis and haplotype mapping in interspecific mouse crosses (Mus musculus x Mus spretus) identified the gene encoding Aurora2 (Stk6 in mouse and STK15 in human) as a candidate skin tumor susceptibility gene. The Stk6 allele inherited from the susceptible M. musculus parent was overexpressed in normal cells and preferentially amplified in tumor cells from F(1) hybrid mice. We identified a common genetic variant in STK15 (resulting in the amino acid substitution F31I) that is preferentially amplified and associated with the degree of aneuploidy in human colon tumors. The Ile31 variant transforms rat1 cells more potently than the more common Phe31 variant. The E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2N was a preferential binding partner of the 'weak' STK15 Phe31 variant form in yeast two-hybrid screens and in human cells. This interaction results in colocalization of UBE2N with STK15 at the centrosomes during mitosis. These results are consistent with an important role for the Ile31 variant of STK15 in human cancer susceptibility.,1
23474327,Prospective evaluation of patients with early-/intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma with disease progression following arterial locoregional therapy: candidacy for systemic treatment or clinical trials,"PURPOSE: During the course of cancer treatment, patients whose disease progresses despite therapy are offered alternative options. Similarly, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) whose disease progresses following arterial locoregional therapies (LRTs) cross over to undergo systemic therapies or participate in clinical trials. Per current guidelines, patients must meet inclusion criteria (most importantly Child-Pugh class A status) to qualify for systemic options. The present study analyzed the candidacy for systemic agents or clinical trials of patients whose disease progresses despite LRTs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 245 patients with HCC were treated with LRTs (chemoembolization, n = 123; yttrium-90 [(90)Y] radioembolization, n = 122) as part of a previously published comparative effectiveness study; 96 patients exhibiting disease progression were followed prospectively. Modes of progression (cancer stage, Child-Pugh class) were analyzed to determine candidacy for systemic therapy or clinical trials, as well as assess ultimate treatment(s) received. RESULTS: Among the 96 patients with disease progression, 52% and 48% had Child-Pugh class A and class B/C disease, respectively, thereby substantially limiting the latter group's eligibility for systemic therapy and/or clinical trials. Of those whose disease progressed who had advanced-stage HCC, 63% had Child-Pugh class B/C disease. By size and necrosis criteria, the local disease progression rate was higher with chemoembolization than with (90)Y radioembolization (P = .006 and P = .016, respectively). Of the 96 patients with disease progression, only 13 (13%) ultimately received systemic agents or entered clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with advanced HCC that progresses following LRTs were not candidates for clinical trials or systemic agents. There is a need for future research efforts directed at treatment options or novel trial designs that will permit inclusion of patients with progressive liver disease and suboptimal liver function.",0

Marine invertebrates and algae living in this habitat are alternatively pounded by waves and exposed to thermal extremes during low tide periods (Denny and Wethey, 2001). Additionally, they must deal with strong selective pressures related to predation and competition for space (Connell, 1961). As a result, the steep physical gradient and spatially condensed community has made the rocky intertidal zone an ideal ",0
17046663,Modeling polyglutamine pathogenesis in C. elegans,"A growing number of human neurodegenerative diseases are associated with disruption of cellular protein folding homeostasis, leading to the appearance of misfolded proteins and deposition of protein aggregates and inclusions. Recent years have been witness to widespread development of invertebrate systems (specifically Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans) to model these disorders, bringing the many advantages of such systems, particularly the power of genetic analysis in a metazoan, to bear on these problems. In this chapter, we describe our studies using the nematode, C. elegans, as a model to study polyglutamine expansions as occur in Huntington's disease and related ataxias. Using fluorescently tagged polyglutamine repeats of different lengths, we have examined the dynamics of aggregate formation both within individual cells and over time throughout the lifetime of individual organisms, identifying aging as an important physiological determinant of aggregation and toxicity. Expanding on these observations, we demonstrate that a genetic pathway regulating longevity can alter the time course of aging-related polyglutamine-mediated phenotypes. To identify novel targets and better understand how cells sense and respond to the appearance of misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins, we use a genome-wide RNA interference-based genetic screen to identify modifiers of age-dependent polyglutamine aggregation. Throughout these studies, we used fluorescence-based, live-cell biological and biophysical methods to study the behavior of these proteins in a complex multicellular environment.",0
11780065,Role of G-protein-coupled adenosine receptors in downregulation of inflammation and protection from tissue damage,"Inappropriate or prolonged inflammation is the main cause of many diseases; for this reason it is important to understand the physiological mechanisms that terminate inflammation in vivo. Agonists for several Gs-protein-coupled receptors, including cell-surface adenosine purinergic receptors, can increase levels of immunosuppressive cyclic AMP in immune cells; however, it was unknown whether any of these receptors regulates inflammation in vivo. Here we show that A2a adenosine receptors have a non-redundant role in the attenuation of inflammation and tissue damage in vivo. Sub-threshold doses of an inflammatory stimulus that caused minimal tissue damage in wild-type mice were sufficient to induce extensive tissue damage, more prolonged and higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and death of male animals deficient in the A2a adenosine receptor. Similar observations were made in studies of three different models of inflammation and liver damage as well as during bacterial endotoxin-induced septic shock. We suggest that A2a adenosine receptors are a critical part of the physiological negative feedback mechanism for limitation and termination of both tissue-specific and systemic inflammatory responses.",1
19633872,Identification of CACNA1A large deletions in four patients with episodic ataxia,"Episodic ataxia is an autosomal dominant ion channel disorder characterized by paroxysmal attacks of incoordination. Episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) is caused by mutations in CACNA1A. EA2 mutations are mostly nonsense and sometimes missense mutations. However, in some typical EA2 families, CACNA1A sequencing does not detect any point mutation. Herein, we have designed a quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction of short fluorescent fragment test to screen the 50 exons of CACNA1A and investigated 27 probands referred for molecular diagnosis of EA2 who did not show any point mutation in CACNA1A. We have identified four different exonic deletions in four patients with a typical EA2 phenotype. These results establish the need to complete sequencing analysis by a screening for deletions to ensure an accurate molecular diagnosis of EA2.",1
11792846,APH-1 is a multipass membrane protein essential for the Notch signaling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos,"Early embryonic cells in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos interact through a signaling pathway closely related to the Notch signaling pathway in Drosophila and vertebrates. Components of this pathway include a ligand, receptor, the presenilin proteins, and a novel protein, APH-2, that is related to the Nicastrin protein in humans. Here we identify the aph-1 gene as a new component of the Notch pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans. aph-1 is predicted to encode a novel, highly conserved multipass membrane protein. We show that aph-1 and the presenilin genes share a similar function in that they are both required for proper cell-surface localization of APH-2/Nicastrin.",1
2901432,Catabolic rate of low density lipoprotein is influenced by variation in the apolipoprotein B gene,"This study examines the potential influence of genetic variation on the metabolism of LDL. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of the gene coding for apo B were identified using the endonucleases Xba I, Eco RI, and Msp I in a group of 19 subjects with moderate hyperlipidemia. There was a significant association between the Xba I polymorphism and the total fractional clearance rate (FCR) of LDL. The individuals with the X1X1 genotype had, on average, a 22% higher FCR (P less than 0.025) than those with the genotype X2X2 (X2 allele = presence of Xba I cutting site). This difference was attributable to increased clearance by the receptor-mediated pathway of LDL catabolism. In this group of subjects, there was no association of LDL kinetic parameters and RFLPs of the LDL receptor gene or the AI- CIII- AIV gene cluster. The data suggest that variation in apo B itself, presumably acting through variable binding to the LDL receptor, makes a significant contribution to the rate of catabolism of LDL.",1
18250309,The Timothy syndrome mutation differentially affects voltage- and calcium-dependent inactivation of CaV1.2 L-type calcium channels,"Calcium entry into excitable cells is an important physiological signal, supported by and highly sensitive to the activity of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. After membrane depolarization, Ca2+ channels first open but then undergo various forms of negative feedback regulation including voltage- and calcium-dependent inactivation (VDI and CDI, respectively). Inactivation of Ca2+ channel activity is perturbed in a rare yet devastating disorder known as Timothy syndrome (TS), whose features include autism or autism spectrum disorder along with severe cardiac arrhythmia and developmental abnormalities. Most cases of TS arise from a sporadic single nucleotide change that generates a mutation (G406R) in the pore-forming subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel Ca(V)1.2. We found that the TS mutation powerfully and selectively slows VDI while sparing or possibly speeding the kinetics of CDI. The deceleration of VDI was observed when the L-type channels were expressed with beta1 subunits prominent in brain, as well as beta2 subunits of importance for the heart. Dissociation of VDI and CDI was further substantiated by measurements of Ca2+ channel gating currents and by analysis of another channel mutation (I1624A) that hastens VDI, acting upstream of the step involving Gly406. As highlighted by the TS mutation, CDI does not proceed to completeness but levels off at approximately 50%, consistent with a change in gating modes and not an absorbing inactivation process. Thus, the TS mutation offers a unique perspective on mechanisms of inactivation as well as a promising starting point for exploring the underlying pathophysiology of autism.",1

17106115,Genotype by environment interaction for somatic cell score across bulk milk somatic cell count and days in milk,"The objective of this paper was to investigate the importance of a genotype x environment interaction (G x E) for somatic cell score (SCS) across levels of bulk milk somatic cell count (BMSCC), number of days in milk (DIM), and their interaction. Variance components were estimated with a model including random regressions for each sire on herd test-day BMSCC, DIM, and the interaction of BMSCC and DIM. The analyzed data set contained 344,029 test-day records of 24,125 cows, sired by 182 bulls, in 461 herds comprising 13,563 herd test-days. In early lactation, considerable G x E effects were detected for SCS, indicated by 3-fold higher genetic variance for SCS at high BMSCC compared with SCS at low BMSCC, and a genetic correlation of 0.72 between SCS at low and at high BMSCC. Estimated G x E effects were smaller during late lactation. Genetic correlations between SCS at the same level of BMSCC, across DIM, were between 0.43 and 0.89. The lowest genetic correlation between SCS measures on any 2 possible combinations of BMSCC and DIM was 0.42. Correlated responses in SCS across BMSCC and DIM were, on some occasions, less than half the direct response to selection in the response environment. Responses to selection were reasonably high among environments in the second half of the lactation, whereas responses to selection between environments early and late in lactation tended to be low. Selection for reduced SCS yielded the highest direct response early in lactation at high BMSCC.",0
2164822,"Deficiencies of human C3 complement receptors type 1 (CR1, CD35) and type 2 (CR2, CD21)","CR1 (CD35) and CR2 (CD21) are structurally related integral transmembrane glycoproteins that function as cellular receptors for human C3b and C3dg, respectively. The primary sequence of the most common structural allotype of CR1 and that of CR2 have been established, and ligand binding on the molecules has been mapped. CR1 and CR2 genes are located in close vicinity in the RCA locus of chromosome 1. CR1 has a wide cellular/tissular distribution and mediates a variety of biologic functions, including the transport of C3-bearing immune complexes on erythrocytes, enhancement of phagocytosis, induction of IL-1 secretion and enhancement of B-cell differentiation. Expression of CR2 is restricted to B lymphocytes and follicular dendritic cells. The receptor modulates B-cell growth. CR2 also serves as the receptor for EBV and determines the cellular tropism of the virus. This review discusses the molecular biology and functional characteristics of CR1 and CR2. It focuses on alterations of expression of the receptors in disease, with particular emphasis on the genetic and acquired factors that contribute to the defective expression of CR1 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.",0
7795652,Somatic mutations in the BRCA1 gene in sporadic ovarian tumours,"The BRCA1 gene on chromosome 17q21 is responsible for an autosomal dominant syndrome of increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer but no somatic mutations in tumours have yet been described. To study the potential role of BRCA1 in sporadic carcinogenesis, we analysed the genomic DNA of tumour and normal fractions of 47 ovarian cancers for mutations in BRCA1 using the single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. We now describe somatic mutations in the DNA of four tumours which also had loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at a BRCA1 intragenic marker. Our data support a tumour suppressor mechanism for BRCA1; somatic mutations and LOH may result in inactivation of BRCA1 in at least a small number of ovarian cancers.",1
26893108,Diagnostic Value of Right Pulmonary Artery Distensibility Index in Dogs with Pulmonary Hypertension: Comparison with Doppler Echocardiographic Estimates of Pulmonary Arterial Pressure,"BACKGROUND: Noninvasive diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) primarily relies upon Doppler echocardiography of tricuspid regurgitation (TR). However, TR might be absent or difficult to measure. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic value of right pulmonary artery distensibility (RPAD) index for prediction of Doppler-derived estimates of pulmonary artery (PA) pressure compared to other indices of PH in dogs. ANIMALS: Sixty-nine client-owned dogs with TR. METHODS: Prospective observational study. Dogs were allocated to groups according to TR pressure gradient (TRPG): TRPG <36 mmHg (control, n = 22), TRPG 36-50 (n = 16), TRPG 50-75 (n = 14) and TRPG >75 mmHg (n = 17). Right pulmonary artery distensibility index, acceleration time to peak PA flow (AT), AT: ejection time of PA flow (AT:ET) and main PA size: aorta size (MPA:Ao) were calculated in each dog. RESULTS: Right pulmonary artery distensibility index demonstrated the strongest correlation (r = -0.90; P < .0001) to TRPG followed by MPA:Ao (r = 0.78; P < .0001), AT (r = -0.69; P < .0001) and AT:ET (r = -0.68; P < .0001). RPAD index possessed the most accurate cutoff (<29.5%; Sensitivity [Sn] 0.84, Specificity [Sp] 0.95) to predict TRPG >50 mmHg compared to AT (<53.9 ms; Sn 0.74, Sp 0.87), AT:ET (<0.30; Sn 0.61, Sp 0.97) and MPA:Ao (>1.04; Sn 0.94, Sp 0.74). All intra- and interobserver measurement variabilities exhibited coefficients of variation </=13%. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Right pulmonary artery distensibility index is an accurate predictor of TRPG and should be particularly useful if TR is absent or difficult to measure.",0
11017075,Large expansion of the ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in spinocerebellar ataxia type 10,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10; MIM 603516; refs 1,2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia and seizures. The gene SCA10 maps to a 3.8-cM interval on human chromosome 22q13-qter (refs 1,2). Because several other SCA subtypes show trinucleotide repeat expansions, we examined microsatellites in this region. We found an expansion of a pentanucleotide (ATTCT) repeat in intron 9 of SCA10 in all patients in five Mexican SCA10 families. There was an inverse correlation between the expansion size, up to 22.5 kb larger than the normal allele, and the age of onset (r2=0.34, P=0.018). Analysis of 562 chromosomes from unaffected individuals of various ethnic origins (including 242 chromosomes from Mexican persons) showed a range of 10 to 22 ATTCT repeats with no evidence of expansions. Our data indicate that the new SCA10 intronic ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in SCA10 patients is unstable and represents the largest microsatellite expansion found so far in the human genome.",1

18390344,Segmentation of pulmonary nodules in thoracic CT scans: a region growing approach,"This paper presents an efficient algorithm for segmenting different types of pulmonary nodules including high and low contrast nodules, nodules with vasculature attachment, and nodules in the close vicinity of the lung wall or diaphragm. The algorithm performs an adaptive sphericity oriented contrast region growing on the fuzzy connectivity map of the object of interest. This region growing is operated within a volumetric mask which is created by first applying a local adaptive segmentation algorithm that identifies foreground and background regions within a certain window size. The foreground objects are then filled to remove any holes, and a spatial connectivity map is generated to create a 3-D mask. The mask is then enlarged to contain the background while excluding unwanted foreground regions. Apart from generating a confined search volume, the mask is also used to estimate the parameters for the subsequent region growing, as well as for repositioning the seed point in order to ensure reproducibility. The method was run on 815 pulmonary nodules. By using randomly placed seed points, the approach was shown to be fully reproducible. As for acceptability, the segmentation results were visually inspected by a qualified radiologist to search for any gross miss-segmentation. 84% of the first results of the segmentation were accepted by the radiologist while for the remaining 16% nodules, alternative segmentation solutions that were provided by the method were selected.",0
1793237,The distally based posterior interosseous island flap for the coverage of skin loss of the hand,"Eight patients with skin coverage of the hand by the distally based posterior interosseous island flap (DBPIIF) are presented. The first web was reconstructed in 6 and the volar and dorsal aspect of the hand in 2 patients. Primary closure of the donor sites has always been possible. An echo Doppler examination is indicated to verify the presence and size of the vessel and the direction of its flow. The dissection of the vascular pedicle, however, is frequently quite complex and time consuming. To better appreciate the cosmetic aspect of the DBPIIF and its donor site, a random study has been undertaken to compare this flap with the radial forearm and the groin flap and their corresponding donor sites. Females have more often preferred the groin flap, whereas doctors preferred the DBPIIF. Reliability, a good aesthetic result at the donor site, and the preservation of the main vessels of the hand are the specific merits of the DBPIIF.",0

The main findings of this study were a positive relationship between CHI patients' level of social skill and their rate of positive effect, and an inverse relationship between the CHI patients' level of social skill and the rate of facilitative behaviour displayed by relatives during problem-solving interactions. It is suggested that socially unskilled CHI patients may be more demanding to interact with, and that this may cause a significant burden for their relatives.",0
27281199,Aberrant PD-L1 expression through 3'-UTR disruption in multiple cancers,"Successful treatment of many patients with advanced cancer using antibodies against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; also known as PDCD1) and its ligand (PD-L1; also known as CD274) has highlighted the critical importance of PD-1/PD-L1-mediated immune escape in cancer development. However, the genetic basis for the immune escape has not been fully elucidated, with the exception of elevated PD-L1 expression by gene amplification and utilization of an ectopic promoter by translocation, as reported in Hodgkin and other B-cell lymphomas, as well as stomach adenocarcinoma. Here we show a unique genetic mechanism of immune escape caused by structural variations (SVs) commonly disrupting the 3' region of the PD-L1 gene. Widely affecting multiple common human cancer types, including adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (27%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (8%), and stomach adenocarcinoma (2%), these SVs invariably lead to a marked elevation of aberrant PD-L1 transcripts that are stabilized by truncation of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Disruption of the Pd-l1 3'-UTR in mice enables immune evasion of EG7-OVA tumour cells with elevated Pd-l1 expression in vivo, which is effectively inhibited by Pd-1/Pd-l1 blockade, supporting the role of relevant SVs in clonal selection through immune evasion. Our findings not only unmask a novel regulatory mechanism of PD-L1 expression, but also suggest that PD-L1 3'-UTR disruption could serve as a genetic marker to identify cancers that actively evade anti-tumour immunity through PD-L1 overexpression.",1

20141359,Confirmation of ADAMTSL4 mutations for autosomal recessive isolated bilateral ectopia lentis,"Ectopia lentis (EL) is a zonular disease where alteration of the zonular fibers leads progressively to lens dislocation. It is most often associated with systemic diseases such as Marfan syndrome, Weill-Marchesani syndrome or homocystinuria. Isolated non syndromic ectopia lentis (IEL) is reported in families with autosomal inheritance, with dominant forms being more common than recessive. LTBP2 truncating mutations have been described as a cause of autosomal recessive ectopia lentis as a primary or secondary feature in patients showing ocular (eg, glaucoma) or extraocular manifestations (eg, Marfanoid habitus). Recently, ADAMTSL4 has been shown to be responsible for isolated autosomal recessive ectopia lentis in an inbred family. Herein we show a consanguineous family that carries a novel homozygous splice mutation IVS4-1G>A/IVS4-1G>A in ADAMTSL4 responsible for isolated autosomal recessive EL, thus confirming the involvement of this gene in this condition and underlining the major role of ADAMTS proteases in zonular fibers homeostasis.",1
15373745,Characterization of an X-chromosome PCR-RFLP marker associated with fat deposition and growth in the pig,"The X-chromosome, highly conserved within mammals, has been shown to contain major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for growth and fat deposition in the pig. We have discovered a BamHI polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) marker that was assigned to the porcine X-chromosome by two-point and multi-point linkage analysis following genotyping of a three-generation Berkshire by Yorkshire reference family. The marker was positioned 9 cM telomeric to SW2126 and 15.6 cM centromeric to SW1943. Sequence flanking the marker was found to have high similarity to existing database porcine DNA repeat elements. Association analyses of the BamHI marker for growth and meat quality traits in the reference family revealed significant association with marbling (P < 0.03), 10th rib back fat (P < 0.09) and total lipid percentage (P < 0.05), as well as with loin eye area (P < 0.04), average glycolytic potential (P < 0.03) and average lactate content (P < 0.04). Further studies are required to determine the X-chromosome functional gene affecting fat deposition and growth in the pig.",0
17576410,BACE1 regulates voltage-gated sodium channels and neuronal activity,"BACE1 activity is significantly increased in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, potentially contributing to neurodegeneration. The voltage-gated sodium channel (Na(v)1) beta2-subunit (beta2), a type I membrane protein that covalently binds to Na(v)1 alpha-subunits, is a substrate for BACE1 and gamma-secretase. Here, we find that BACE1-gamma-secretase cleavages release the intracellular domain of beta2, which increases mRNA and protein levels of the pore-forming Na(v)1.1 alpha-subunit in neuroblastoma cells. Similarly, endogenous beta2 processing and Na(v)1.1 protein levels are elevated in brains of BACE1-transgenic mice and Alzheimer's disease patients with high BACE1 levels. However, Na(v)1.1 is retained inside the cells and cell surface expression of the Na(v)1 alpha-subunits and sodium current densities are markedly reduced in both neuroblastoma cells and adult hippocampal neurons from BACE1-transgenic mice. BACE1, by cleaving beta2, thus regulates Na(v)1 alpha-subunit levels and controls cell-surface sodium current densities. BACE1 inhibitors may normalize membrane excitability in Alzheimer's disease patients with elevated BACE1 activity.",1

12384701,Myc suppression of the p21(Cip1) Cdk inhibitor influences the outcome of the p53 response to DNA damage,"Activation of the tumour suppressor p53 by DNA damage induces either cell cycle arrest or apoptotic cell death. The cytostatic effect of p53 is mediated by transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21(Cip1), whereas the apoptotic effect is mediated by transcriptional activation of mediators including PUMA and PIG3 (ref. 2). What determines the choice between cytostasis and apoptosis is not clear. Here we show that the transcription factor Myc is a principal determinant of this choice. Myc is directly recruited to the p21(Cip1) promoter by the DNA-binding protein Miz-1. This interaction blocks p21(Cip1) induction by p53 and other activators. As a result Myc switches, from cytostatic to apoptotic, the p53-dependent response of colon cancer cells to DNA damage. Myc does not modify the ability of p53 to bind to the p21(Cip1) or PUMA promoters, but selectively inhibits bound p53 from activating p21(Cip1) transcription. By inhibiting p21(Cip1) expression Myc favours the initiation of apoptosis, thereby influencing the outcome of a p53 response in favour of cell death.",1
9621516,"Cloning and chromosomal mapping of a novel ABC transporter gene (hABC7), a candidate for X-linked sideroblastic anemia with spinocerebellar ataxia","We isolated a novel human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter cDNA, determined its nucleotide sequence, and designated it human ABC7 (hABC7). The nucleotide sequence was highly homologous to the ATM1 gene in yeast, which encodes an ABC transporter (yAtm1p) located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The deduced human product, a putative half-type transporter, consists of 752 amino acids that are 48.9% identical to those of yAtm1p. A computer-assisted protein structural and localization analysis revealed that the mitochondrial targeting signal of yAtm1p is conserved in the N-terminal region of the primary sequence of the hABC7 protein, and therefore this product is also likely to be located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The evidence strongly suggests that the hABC7 gene is a counterpart of ATM1 and that its product is probably involved in heme transport. We mapped the hABC7 gene to chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3 by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. As band Xq13 has been implicated in X-linked sideroblastic anemia with spinocerebellar ataxia, hABC7 becomes a candidate gene for this heritable disorder.",1
22321049,Age- and gender-specific population attributable risks of metabolic disorders on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND: The extent of attributable risks of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components on mortality remains unclear, especially with respect to age and gender. We aimed to assess the age- and gender-specific population attributable risks (PARs) for cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality and all-cause mortality for public health planning. METHODS: A total of 2,092 men and 2,197 women 30 years of age and older, who were included in the 2002 Taiwan Survey of Hypertension, Hyperglycemia, and Hyperlipidemia (TwSHHH), were linked to national death certificates acquired through December 31, 2009. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios and PARs for mortality, with a median follow-up of 7.7 years. RESULTS: The respective PAR percentages of MetS for all-cause and CVD-related mortality were 11.6 and 39.2 in men, respectively, and 18.6 and 44.4 in women, respectively. Central obesity had the highest PAR for CVD mortality in women (57.5%), whereas arterial hypertension had the highest PAR in men (57.5%). For all-cause mortality, younger men and post-menopausal women had higher PARs related to Mets and its components; for CVD mortality, post-menopausal women had higher overall PARs than their pre-menopausal counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: MetS has a limited application to the PAR for all-cause mortality, especially in men; its PAR for CVD mortality is more evident. For CVD mortality, MetS components have higher PARs than MetS itself, especially hypertension in men and waist circumference in post-menopausal women. In addition, PARs for diabetes mellitus and low HDL-cholesterol may exceed 20%. We suggest differential control of risk factors in different subpopulation as a strategy to prevent CVD-related mortality.",0
18285826,ABCA4 gene analysis in patients with autosomal recessive cone and cone rod dystrophies,"The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters constitute a family of large membrane proteins, which transport a variety of substrates across membranes. The ABCA4 protein is expressed in photoreceptors and possibly functions as a transporter for N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine (N-retinylidene-PE), the Schiff base adduct of all-trans-retinal with PE. Mutations in the ABCA4 gene have been initially associated with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease. Subsequent studies have shown that mutations in ABCA4 can also cause a variety of other retinal dystrophies including cone rod dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa. To determine the prevalence and mutation spectrum of ABCA4 gene mutations in non-Stargardt phenotypes, we have screened 64 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive cone (arCD) and cone rod dystrophy (arCRD) applying the Asper Ophthalmics ABCR400 microarray followed by DNA sequencing of all coding exons of the ABCA4 gene in subjects with single heterozygous mutations. Disease-associated ABCA4 alleles were identified in 20 of 64 patients with arCD or arCRD. In four of 64 patients (6%) only one mutant ABCA4 allele was detected and in 16 patients (25%), mutations on both ABCA4 alleles were identified. Based on these data we estimate a prevalence of 31% for ABCA4 mutations in arCD and arCRD, supporting the concept that the ABCA4 gene is a major locus for various types of degenerative retinal diseases with abnormalities in cone or both cone and rod function.",1
11875398,Diurnal modulation of pacemaker potentials and calcium current in the mammalian circadian clock,"The central biological clock of the mammalian brain is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This hypothalamic region contains neurons that generate a circadian rhythm on a single-cell basis. Clock cells transmit their circadian timing signals to other brain areas by diurnal modulation of their spontaneous firing rate. The intracellular mechanism underlying rhythm generation is thought to consist of one or more self-regulating molecular loops, but it is unknown how these loops interact with the plasma membrane to modulate the ionic conductances that regulate firing behaviour. Here we demonstrate a diurnal modulation of Ca2+ current in suprachiasmatic neurons. This current strongly contributes to the generation of spontaneous oscillations in membrane potential, which occur selectively during daytime and are tightly coupled to spike generation. Thus, day-night modulation of Ca2+ current is a central step in transducing the intracellular cycling of molecular clocks to the rhythm in spontaneous firing rate.",1
24359638,ATHENA: Identifying interactions between different levels of genomic data associated with cancer clinical outcomes using grammatical evolution neural network,"BACKGROUND: Gene expression profiles have been broadly used in cancer research as a diagnostic or prognostic signature for the clinical outcome prediction such as stage, grade, metastatic status, recurrence, and patient survival, as well as to potentially improve patient management. However, emerging evidence shows that gene expression-based prediction varies between independent data sets. One possible explanation of this effect is that previous studies were focused on identifying genes with large main effects associated with clinical outcomes. Thus, non-linear interactions without large individual main effects would be missed. The other possible explanation is that gene expression as a single level of genomic data is insufficient to explain the clinical outcomes of interest since cancer can be dysregulated by multiple alterations through genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome levels. In order to overcome the variability of diagnostic or prognostic predictors from gene expression alone and to increase its predictive power, we need to integrate multi-levels of genomic data and identify interactions between them associated with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Here, we proposed an integrative framework for identifying interactions within/between multi-levels of genomic data associated with cancer clinical outcomes using the Grammatical Evolution Neural Networks (GENN). In order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework, ovarian cancer data from TCGA was used as a pilot task. We found not only interactions within a single genomic level but also interactions between multi-levels of genomic data associated with survival in ovarian cancer. Notably, the integration model from different levels of genomic data achieved 72.89% balanced accuracy and outperformed the top models with any single level of genomic data. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the underlying tumorigenesis and progression in ovarian cancer through the global view of interactions within/between different levels of genomic data is expected to provide guidance for improved prognostic biomarkers and individualized therapies.",0
12076535,The SOCS box: a tale of destruction and degradation,"Although initially identified in the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family of proteins, the C-terminal SOCS box has now been identified in more than 40 proteins in nine different families. Growing evidence suggests that the SOCS box, similar to the F-box, acts as a bridge between specific substrate-binding domains and the more generic proteins that comprise a large family of E3 ubiquitin protein ligases. In this way, SOCS proteins regulate protein turnover by targeting proteins for polyubiquitination and, therefore, for proteasome-mediated degradation.",1
1840554,Regulated expression of three C/EBP isoforms during adipose conversion of 3T3-L1 cells,"In an effort to identify protein factors that play a regulatory role in the differentiation of adipocytes, we have isolated two genes that encode polypeptides related to CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP; hereafter termed C/EBP alpha). The proteins encoded by these C/EBP-related genes, termed C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta, exhibit similar DNA-binding specificities and affinities compared with C/EBP alpha. Furthermore, C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta readily form heterodimers with one another as well as with C/EBP alpha. The transcriptional activating capacity of these two newly identified C/EBP isoforms was demonstrated by transient transfection experiments in which expression vectors encoding C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta were observed to induce transcription from the promoter of the serum albumin gene in cultured hepatoma cells. The mRNAs encoding C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta were detected in a number of tissues, most of which corresponded to sites of expression of C/EBP alpha. The expression pattern of C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta during adipose conversion of 3T3-L1 cells was examined by Western and Northern blotting assays. In contrast to the expression profile of the gene encoding C/EBP alpha, whose product is not detectable until the late phase of adipocyte differentiation, the c/ebp beta and c/ebp delta genes were actively expressed very early during adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, transcription of the c/ebp beta and c/ebp delta genes was observed to be induced directly by adipogenic hormones. The accumulation of C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta reached a maximal level during the first 2 days of differentiation and declined sharply before the onset of C/EBP alpha accumulation. The temporal pattern of expression of these three C/EBP isoforms during adipocyte differentiation may reflect the underpinnings of a regulatory cascade that controls the process of terminal cell differentiation.",1
10201372,Beta-catenin regulates expression of cyclin D1 in colon carcinoma cells,"Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour-suppressor gene occur in most human colon cancers. Loss of functional APC protein results in the accumulation of beta-catenin. Mutant forms of beta-catenin have been discovered in colon cancers that retain wild-type APC genes, and also in melanomas, medulloblastomas, prostate cancer and gastric and hepatocellular carcinomas. The accumulation of beta-catenin activates genes that are responsive to transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family, with which beta-catenin interacts. Here we show that beta-catenin activates transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter, and that sequences within the promoter that are related to consensus TCF/LEF-binding sites are necessary for activation. The oncoprotein p21ras further activates transcription of the cyclin D1 gene, through sites within the promoter that bind the transcriptional regulators Ets or CREB. Cells expressing mutant beta-catenin produce high levels of cyclin D1 messenger RNA and protein constitutively. Furthermore, expression of a dominant-negative form of TCF in colon-cancer cells strongly inhibits expression of cyclin D1 without affecting expression of cyclin D2, cyclin E, or cyclin-dependent kinases 2, 4 or 6. This dominant-negative TCF causes cells to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle; this phenotype can be rescued by expression of cyclin D1 under the cytomegalovirus promoter. Abnormal levels of beta-catenin may therefore contribute to neoplastic transformation by causing accumulation of cyclin D1.",1
12921944,Comparison of interphase FISH and metaphase cytogenetics to study myelodysplastic syndrome: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) study,"Cytogenetic analysis can be important in determining the prognosis and diagnosis of a number of hematological disorders, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Here, we compared metaphase chromosomal analyses on bone marrow aspirates from MDS patients with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes specific for chromosomes nos. 5, 7, 8, 11, 13 and 20. Forty-three patients enrolled in ECOG protocol E1996 for low risk MDS and five patients enrolled in ECOG protocol E3996 for high risk MDS were studied by both metaphase chromosomal analysis and interphase FISH. Excluding those with a clonal loss of the Y chromosome, an abnormal clone was detected by cytogenetic analysis in 18 of 48 samples (37.5%). In comparison, our FISH panel detected an abnormal clone in 17 of 48 samples (35.4%). Twenty-nine of 30 samples with apparently normal karyotypes, including those with a missing Y chromosome, were also normal by our FISH panel. One patient had an occult deletion of chromosome 11 that was detected by FISH. These results indicate that around 60% of patients with MDS do not have abnormalities that are detectable by either chromosomal or FISH studies. In addition, it appears that interphase FISH studies are nearly as sensitive as cytogenetic analyses and can be a useful tool in studying bone marrow aspirates where cytogenetic analysis is not possible.",0
23791823,Transmission of the respiratory rhythm to trigeminal and hypoglossal motor neurons in the American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeiana),"Spatially distinct, interacting oscillators in the bullfrog medulla generate and coordinated buccal and lung ventilatory rhythms, but how these rhythms are transmitted onto trigeminal and hypoglossal motor neurons is unknown. Using a vertically-mounted isolated brainstem preparation, the Sheep Dip, we identified the regions of the brainstem containing motor nuclei using a solution capable of blocking synaptic release and, following washout, locally exposed these regions to 5 muM NBQX and/or 50 muM AP5. Local application of NBQX significantly reduced the amplitude of buccal and lung bursts on the trigeminal nerve, and lung bursts on the hypoglossal nerve. Local AP5 caused a significant reduction in lung burst amplitude on both nerves, but for buccal bursts, hypoglossal amplitude increased and trigeminal amplitude was unchanged. Local co-application of NBQX and AP5 eliminated fictive respiratory motor output completely in both nerves. These results are consistent with mammalian data, suggesting a critical role for glutamate in transmission of respiratory activity from oscillators to motor neurons.",0
30984688,Why psychiatry as a career: Effect of factors on medical students' motivation,"Context: The number of Saudi psychiatrists in Saudi Arabia is not sufficient to keep up with the increasing need.[1] Approximately out of 6873 physicians, only 148 are psychiatrists, which is barely 2.1%.[2] Despite the high number of medical students graduating each year and the high demand for psychiatry physicians, only few medical graduates choose psychiatry as a career option.[3]. Aims: To investigate the profile of final year medical students of both sexes at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In terms of their decisions regarding specialization, this study aimed to identify the motivators and deterrents that impact the choice of psychiatry as specialty. Subjects and Methods: Students filled in a self-reported questionnaire focusing on the several factors that act as motivators, deterrents, or have no impact on psychiatry career choice. Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)((R)) version 20. Different factors were expressed in terms of numbers and percentages. Chi-square test was used to compare responses to the questionnaire between male and female students and whether the GPA had an effect on their choice. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: It was noted that 85% did not choose psychiatry, with the most important deterrent being ",0

19479957,Primary hyperoxaluria type 1: update and additional mutation analysis of the AGXT gene,"Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is an autosomal recessive, inherited disorder of glyoxylate metabolism arising from a deficiency of the alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) enzyme, encoded by the AGXT gene. The disease is manifested by excessive endogenous oxalate production, which leads to impaired renal function and associated morbidity. At least 146 mutations have now been described, 50 of which are newly reported here. The mutations, which occur along the length of the AGXT gene, are predominantly single-nucleotide substitutions (75%), 73 are missense, 19 nonsense, and 18 splice mutations; but 36 major and minor deletions and insertions are also included. There is little association of mutation with ethnicity, the most obvious exception being the p.Ile244Thr mutation, which appears to have North African/Spanish origins. A common, polymorphic variant encoding leucine at codon 11, the so-called minor allele, has significantly lower catalytic activity in vitro, and has a higher frequency in PH1 compared to the rest of the population. This polymorphism influences enzyme targeting in the presence of the most common Gly170Arg mutation and potentiates the effect of several other pathological sequence variants. This review discusses the spectrum of AGXT mutations and polymorphisms, their clinical significance, and their diagnostic relevance.",1
25636621,Three computational tools for predicting bacterial essential genes,"Essential genes are those genes indispensable for the survival of any living cell. Bacterial essential genes constitute the cornerstones of synthetic biology and are often attractive targets in the development of antibiotics and vaccines. Because identification of essential genes with wet-lab ways often means expensive economic costs and tremendous labor, scientists changed to seek for alternative way of computational prediction. Aiming to help to solve this issue, our research group (CEFG: group of Computational, Comparative, Evolutionary and Functional Genomics, http://cefg.uestc.edu.cn) has constructed three online services to predict essential genes in bacterial genomes. These freely available tools are applicable for single gene sequences without annotated functions, single genes with definite names, and complete genomes of bacterial strains. To ensure reliable predictions, the investigated species should belong to the same family (for EGP) or phylum (for CEG_Match and Geptop) with one of the reference species, respectively. As the pilot software for the issue, predicting accuracies of them have been assessed and compared with existing algorithms, and note that all of other published algorithms have not any formed online services. We hope these services at CEFG will help scientists and researchers in the field of essential genes.",0
24165086,"The evolution of genomic imprinting: costs, benefits and long-term consequences","Genomic imprinting refers to a pattern of gene expression in which a specific parent's allele is either under-expressed or completely silenced. Imprinting is an evolutionary conundrum because it appears to incur the costs of diploidy (e.g. presenting a larger target than haploidy to mutations) while foregoing its benefits (protection from harmful recessive mutations). Here, we critically evaluate previously proposed evolutionary benefits of imprinting and suggest some additional ones. We discuss whether each benefit is capable of explaining both the origin and maintenance of imprinting, and examine how the different benefits interact. We then outline the many costs of imprinting. Simple models show that circulating deleterious recessives can prevent the initial spread of imprinting, even if imprinting would be evolutionarily stable if it could persist long enough to purge these. We also show that imprinting can raise or lower the mutation load, depending on the selective regime and the degree of dominance. We finish by discussing the population-level consequences of imprinting, which can be both positive and negative. Imprinting offers many insights into evolutionary conflict, the interaction between individual- and population-level fitness effects, and the 'gene's-eye view' of evolution. ",0
10582163,Live attenuated Salmonella: a paradigm of mucosal vaccines,"Two key steps control immune responses in mucosal tissues: the sampling and transepithelial transport of antigens, and their targeting into professional antigen-presenting cells in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Live Salmonella bacteria use strategies that allow them to cross the epithelial barrier of the gut, to survive in antigen-presenting cells where bacterial antigens are processed and presented to the immune cells, and to express adjuvant activity that prevents induction of oral tolerance. Two Salmonella serovars have been used as vaccines or vectors, S. typhimurium in mice and S. typhi in humans. S. typhimurium causes gastroenteritis in a broad host range, including humans, while S. typhi infection is restricted to humans. Attenuated S. typhimurium has been used successfully in mice to induce systemic and mucosal responses against more than 60 heterologous antigens. This review aims to revisit S. typhimurium-based vaccination, as an alternative to S. typhi, with special emphasis on the molecular pathogenesis of S. typhimurium and the host response. We then discuss how such knowledge constitutes the basis for the rational design of novel live mucosal vaccines.",0
12860808,Retinal and optic disc atrophy associated with a CACNA1F mutation in a Japanese family,"OBJECTIVE: To describe retinal and optic disc atrophy and a progressive decrease of visual function in 2 Japanese brothers. Both had a mutation in the CACNA1F gene, the causative gene of incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). METHODS: We studied observational case reports and performed comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations including best-corrected visual acuity, biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, fundus photography, and electroretinography. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood, and all 48 exons of the CACNA1F gene were directly sequenced. RESULTS: The 2 brothers had retinal and optic disc atrophy and a progressive reduction of visual acuity with increasing age. Although these clinical features are not typical of previous patients with incomplete CSNB, both patients had an in-frame mutation with deletion and insertion in exon 4 of the CACNA1F gene. In both patients, the bright-flash, mixed rod-cone electroretinogram had a negative configuration, a characteristic of incomplete CSNB. However, the full-field scotopic and photopic electroretinograms were nonrecordable, indicating severe, diffuse retinal malfunction, which is not typical in incomplete CSNB. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that a mutation of the CACNA1F gene may be associated with retinal and optic disc atrophy with a progressive decline of visual function. Clinical Relevance In patients with retinal and optic disc atrophy associated with negative-type electroretinograms, a CACNA1F gene mutation should be considered.",1
9598305,Genetic mapping of a locus (mass1) causing audiogenic seizures in mice,"Frings audiogenic seizure-susceptible mice are a model for sensory-evoked reflex seizures. Their seizure phenotype is characterized by wild running, loss of righting reflex, tonic flexion, and tonic extension in response to high-intensity sound stimulation. The Frings mice represent an inbred colony that has not been genetically characterized. This investigation studied the mode of inheritance for audiogenic seizures by crossing the Frings mouse with the seizure-resistant C57BL/6J mouse. Among the backcross progeny generated by crossing (Frings x C57BL/6J)F1 mice with the Frings strain, 391 of the 836 N2 progeny were audiogenic seizure susceptible, a finding consistent with monogenic inheritance. Genetic mapping and linkage analysis of hybrid mice using MIT microsatellite marker sequences localized the seizure gene, named mass1 for monogenic audiogenic seizure susceptible, to an approximately 3.6 cM interval in the middle of mouse chromosome 13. Linkage of mass1 to chromosome 13 is an important step in identifying the gene associated with a monogenic seizure disorder in mice, which may ultimately lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of human seizure disorders.",1
12060708,A role for ASIC3 in the modulation of high-intensity pain stimuli,"Acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3), a proton-gated ion channel of the degenerins/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) receptor family is expressed predominantly in sensory neurons including nociceptive neurons responding to protons. To study the role of ASIC3 in pain signaling, we generated ASIC3 knockout mice. Mutant animals were healthy and responded normally to most sensory stimuli. However, in behavioral assays for pain responses, ASIC3 null mutant mice displayed a reduced latency to the onset of pain responses, or more pain-related behaviors, when stimuli of moderate to high intensity were used. This unexpected effect seemed independent of the modality of the stimulus and was observed in the acetic acid-induced writhing test (0.6 vs. 0.1-0.5%), in the hot-plate test (52.5 and 55 vs. 50 degrees C), and in tests for mechanically induced pain (tail-pinch vs. von Frey filaments). We postulate that ASIC3 is involved in modulating moderate- to high-intensity pain sensation.",1
11294920,Familial cerebellar ataxia with muscle coenzyme Q10 deficiency,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a clinical syndrome of cerebellar ataxia associated with muscle coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency. BACKGROUND: Muscle CoQ10 deficiency has been reported only in a few patients with a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy characterized by 1) recurrent myoglobinuria; 2) brain involvement (seizures, ataxia, mental retardation), and 3) ragged-red fibers and lipid storage in the muscle biopsy. METHODS: Having found decreased CoQ10 levels in muscle from a patient with unclassified familial cerebellar ataxia, the authors measured CoQ10 in muscle biopsies from other patients in whom cerebellar ataxia could not be attributed to known genetic causes. RESULTS: The authors found muscle CoQ10 deficiency (26 to 35% of normal) in six patients with cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, and seizures. All six patients responded to CoQ10 supplementation; strength increased, ataxia improved, and seizures became less frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Primary CoQ10 deficiency is a potentially important cause of familial ataxia and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of this condition because CoQ10 administration seems to improve the clinical picture.",1
20598862,Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) expression level is correlated with the expression of the sister protein ADNP2: deregulation in schizophrenia,"Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) and the homologous protein ADNP2 provide cell protection. ADNP is essential for brain formation, proper brain development and neuronal plasticity, all reported to be impaired in the schizophrenia patient brains. Furthermore, reduction in ADNP expression affects social interactions, a major hallmark of schizophrenia. To evaluate a possible involvement of ADNP and ADNP2 in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in humans, we measured relative brain mRNA transcripts of both proteins compared with control subjects. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction in postmortem hippocampal specimens from normal control subjects exhibited a significant ADNP to ADNP2 transcript level correlation (r=0.931, p<0.001), also apparent in a neuroglial model system. In contrast, in the hippocampus of matched schizophrenia patients, this correlation (r=0.637, p=0.014) was drastically decreased in a statistically significant manner (p=0.03), mirroring disease-associated increased ADNP2 transcripts. In the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia patients the correlation between ADNP and ADNP2 mRNA levels was apparently higher than in the hippocampus (r=0.854, p<0.001), but did not reach a significant difference (p=0.25). Thus, imbalance in ADNP/ADNP2 expression in the brain may impact disease progression in schizophrenia.",1

To curb this, waste transfer stations are used. The Kumasi Metropolitan Area, even though it has an engineered landfill, is faced with the problem of waste collection from the generation centres to the final disposal site. Thus in this study, multi-criteria decision analysis incorporated into a geographic information system was used to determine potential waste transfer station sites. The key result established 11 sites located within six different sub-metros. This result can be used by decision makers for site selection of the waste transfer stations after taking into account other relevant ecological and economic factors.",0
32483737,Natural Killer Cell Immunotherapy for Osteosarcoma,"Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that have the ability to recognize malignant cells through balanced recognition of cell-surface indicators of stress and danger. Once activated through such recognition, NK cells release cytokines and induce target cell lysis through multiple mechanisms. NK cells are increasingly recognized for their role in controlling tumor progression and metastasis and as important mediators of immunotherapeutic modalities such as cytokines, antibodies, immunomodulating drugs, and stem cell transplantation. Recent advances in manipulating NK cell number, function, and genetic modification have caused renewed interest in their potential for adoptive immunotherapies, which are actively being tested in clinical trials. Here, we summarize the evidence for NK cell recognition of osteosarcoma, discuss immune therapies that are directly or indirectly dependent on NK cell function, and describe potential approaches for manipulating NK cell number and function to enhance therapy against osteosarcoma.",0
25388785,Pathogenic Ubqln2 gains toxic properties to induce neuron death,"Mutations in ubiquilin 2 (Ubqln2) is linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. A foremost question regarding Ubqln2 pathogenesis is whether pathogenically mutated Ubqln2 causes neuron death via a gain or loss of functions. To better understand Ubqln2 pathobiology, we created Ubqln2 transgenic and knockout rats and compared phenotypic expression in these novel rat models. Overexpression of Ubqln2 with a pathogenic mutation (P497H substitution) caused cognitive deficits and neuronal loss in transgenic rats at the age of 130 days. In the transgenic rats, neuronal loss was preceded by the progressive formation of Ubqln2 aggregates and was accompanied by the progressive accumulation of the autophagy substrates p62 and LC3-II and the impairment of endosome pathways. In contrast, none of these pathologies observed in mutant Ubqln2 transgenic rats was detected in Ubqln2 knockout rats at the age of 300 days. Together, our findings in Ubqln2 transgenic and knockout rats collectively suggest that pathogenic Ubqln2 causes neuron death mainly through a gain of unrevealed functions rather than a loss of physiological functions.

32316587,Marathon Run-induced Changes in the Erythropoietin-Erythroferrone-Hepcidin Axis are Iron Dependent,"Alterations in iron metabolism after physical activity are manifested through the rise of blood hepcidin (Hpc) levels. However, in many athletes, no changes in Hpc levels are observed after exercise despite the presence of inflammation. The missing links could be erythropoietin (EPO) and erythroferrone (ERFE), which down-regulate Hpc biosynthesis. EPO, ERFE and Hpc biosynthesis is modified by serum iron through transferrin receptor 2. Consequently, we investigated whether marathon-induced changes in EPO, ERFE and Hpc levels are blood iron-dependent. Twenty-nine healthy male marathon runners were analyzed. Serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, EPO, ERFE and Hpc levels were assessed before, immediately after, and 9 +/- 2 days after the marathon. The runners whose serum Hpc decreased after the marathon (n = 15), showed a significant increase in ERFE levels. In athletes whose serum iron levels were below 105 microg/day (n = 15), serum EPO (p = 0.00) and ERFE levels (p = 0.00) increased with no changes in Hpc concentration. However, in athletes with low serum iron, no changes in EPO levels were observed when serum ferritin exceeded 70 ng/mL (n = 7). Conversely, an increase in ERFE levels was observed in marathoners with low serum iron, independently of serum ferritin (n = 7). This indicates modulation of blood iron may affect exercise-induced changes in the EPO/ERFE/Hpc axis. Further study is needed to fully understand the physiological meaning of the interdependence between iron and the EPO/ERFE/Hpc axis.",0
30862828,Brain functional connectivity is altered in patients with Takotsubo Syndrome,"Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is an acute, reversible cardiomyopathy. The central autonomic nervous system (ANS) is believed to play a role in this disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the patterns of brain functional connectivity in a sample of patients who had experienced a previous episode of TTS. Brain functional connectivity, both at rest and in response to the stressful stimulus of topical cold stimulation, was explored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), network-based statistics (NBS) and graph theory analysis (GTA) in a population consisting of eight patients with a previous episode of TTS and eight sex- and age-matched controls. At rest, a network characterized by increased connectivity in the TTS group compared to controls and comprising elements of the central ANS was identified. GTA revealed increased local efficiency, clustering and strength in regions of the bilateral hippocampus in subjects with a previous episode of TTS. When stressed by local exposure to cold, the TTS group differed significantly from both a pre-stress baseline interval and from the control group, showing increased connectivity in a network that included the left amygdala and the right insula. Based on the results, patients with TTS display a reorganization of cortical and subcortical networks, including areas associated with the emotional response and autonomic regulation. The findings tend to support the hypothesis that a deregulation of autonomic control at the central level plays a significant role in this syndrome.",0
16563070,The use of medications with known or potential anticholinergic activity in patients with dementia receiving cholinesterase inhibitors,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of prescribed medications with anticholinergic activity given concurrently with acetylcholinesterase-inhibitor therapy in long-term care residents with dementia and to recommend dose adjustment or discontinuation of these medications with anticholinergic activity. DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTING: Long-term care facilities in Indiana. PATIENTS: Geriatric residents in long-term care facilities were included if they were receiving both an agent with anticholinergic activity as determined by radioreceptor assay and an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. INTERVENTIONS: Recommendations were made to the resident's physician suggesting substitution, dose reduction, or discontinuation of the agent with anticholinergic activity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of residents with a recommended change in their anticholinergic medication regimen as a result of the consultant pharmacist's recommendation. RESULTS: Of the 2,021 long-term care residents evaluated, 498 (25%) were receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Of the 498 residents receiving acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy, 103 (20.7%) were receiving concurrent medications with anticholinergic activity.

Recent advances in metagenomics and in the incorporation of entire biosynthetic pathways into Saccharomyces cerevisiae have greatly expanded both the fitness and the repertoire of biochemicals that can be synthesized from this popular microorganism. Further, the availability of the S. cerevisiae entire genome sequence allows the application of systems biology approaches for improving its enormous biosynthetic potential. In this review, we will describe some of the efforts on using S. cerevisiae as a cell factory for the biosynthesis of high-value natural products that belong to the families of isoprenoids, flavonoids and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. As natural products are increasingly becoming the center of attention of the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries, the use of S. cerevisiae for their production is only expected to expand in the future, further allowing the biosynthesis of novel molecular structures with unique properties.",0

7104114,Cross-sectional echocardiographic recognition of interruption of aortic arch between left carotid and subclavian arteries,"Interrupted aortic arch is a rare condition, usually lethal in early infancy without treatment. The only characteristic feature on conventional non-invasive investigation is peripheral pulse inequality, which indicates ductal construction, and therefore may be absent or transient and preterminal. We report the cross-sectional echocardiographic findings in seven patients with aortic arch interruption between the left carotid and subclavian arteries. Their ages were 1 day to 7 months (median 7.5 days). The arterial connection was concordant in four, double outlet right ventricle in two, and truncus arteriosus in one. In each case the ascending aorta was small in comparison to the pulmonary trunk. From the suprasternal approach the ascending aorta could be seen to terminate in the left carotid artery, and the ductus to continue smoothly into the descending aorta, with no vestige of an aortic arch linking its ascending and descending portions. The left subclavian artery was seen to arise distal to the ductus in all but one patient. All four patients with ventriculoarterial concordance had pronounced subaortic stenosis caused by posterior displacement of the infundibular septum. Cross-sectional echocardiography therefore provides the only accurate method of non-invasive diagnosis of this condition. It permits early treatment with prostaglandins to prevent ductal closure, a planned approach to cardiac catheterisation, and a further means of investigating the nature of subaortic stenosis in this condition.",0

To investigate the different approaches in the field of functional electrical stimulation (FES) control of gait and address fundamental perquisites to enable FES walking systems to become safer, more practical, and therefore clinically efficacious. Design. Systematic review was conducted from electronic data bases up to March 2008. Studies with innovative control strategies were highlighted for analysis, but all relevant literatures were described to deliver a broad viewpoint. Study Selection. FES studies applying 1) open and closed-loop controllers; 2) control algorithm techniques; or 3) feedback information to the control unit of neuromuscular stimulators via biological signals or artificial sensors. These studies were mostly associated to FES gait. Results. By far, more spinal cord-injured users have benefited from open-loop FES walking systems because they have had an easier and faster setup. However, because of their limitations over the control of knee extension, closed-loop control of gait may be a superior approach. The use of electromyogram to quantify quadriceps fatigue was not considered sufficiently appropriate to predict knee-buckle events; instead, the use of motion sensors for such purposes is recommended. Finite state controllers based on a set of deterministic rules to process feedback signals seemed more suitable to provide accurate command-and-control compared with dynamic or neural network controllers. Conclusions. Progress in the development of closed-loop FES walking systems has been impeded by their lack of practicality. In the near future, this obstacle could be overcome via implanted systems, especially if using controllers based on deterministic rule sets derived from motion sensor feedback.",0

No organism was identifiable on standard microscopy and culture of all drain, blood and urine samples taken. Left nephrectomy with right urinary diversion was performed for sepsis management and to protect the patient's right kidney. Eventually, Ureaplasma species' RNA was detected in the patient's drain fluid using PCR and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The patient was treated successfully with targeted antibiotic therapy and underwent extensive rehabilitation following this.

7348715,Effect of radiation sterilization and aging on ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene,"The mechanical properties of polyethylene components used in prosthesis are altered after fabrication by the sterilization procedure and by the environmental and mechanical aging which occurs after implantation. To assess the importance and extent of these alterations, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylenes from two sources, Hercules 1900 and RCH 1000C, were subjected to gamma-ray irradiation and aging in serum and argon environments. Changes induced by these treatments in the structural and mechanical parameters have been determined by a variety of experimental techniques. The effect of irradiation is to introduce crosslinks and to increase the degree of crystallinity resulting in changes in the tensile properties in the direction of higher stiffness and reduced ductility. Aging for six months produced similar changes with subtle differences. The results suggest that the initially low degree of crystallinity which results from the sluggish mobility of the very long chain molecules offers the opportunity for significant changes in the properties during use in the long run.",0
27586249,Effects of linagliptin on renal endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomised clinical trial,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Endothelial dysfunction predicts cardiovascular damage and renal involvement. Animal experiments and human studies indicate an increased nitric oxide (NO) activity and endothelial NO synthase (NOS) expression in the early stage of type 2 diabetes. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of linagliptin on the endothelial function of the renal vasculature. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, investigator-initiated trial, 62 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned (by computer-generated random code) to receive linagliptin 5 mg (n = 30) or placebo (n = 32) for 4 weeks. The primary objective was to assess endothelial function of the renal vasculature, by constant-infusion input-clearance and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), both before and after blockade of NOS with N (G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). RESULTS: Treatment with linagliptin for 4 weeks reduced fasting, postprandial blood glucose and HbA1c, although not significantly; no change occurred with placebo. Renal plasma flow (RPF) did not change after linagliptin or placebo. After 4 weeks the absolute change in RPF due to L-NMMA was smaller in the linagliptin group than in the placebo group (-46.8 +/- 34 vs -65.1 +/- 36 ml/min, p = 0.045), indicating a lower basal NO activity after treatment with linagliptin. Consistently, the response of UACR to L-NMMA increased in the placebo group (p = 0.059) but not in the linagliptin group (p = 0.276), pointing to an upregulation of NO activity in the placebo group. No clinically meaningful safety concerns were evident. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that treatment with the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin for 4 weeks prevented the impairment of renal endothelial function due to hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes.

12489753,The specificity of Ca2+ signalling,"A calcium signal is a sudden increase in concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+) in the cytosol. Such signals are crucial for the control of many important functions of the body. In the brain, for example, Ca2+ signals are responsible for memory, in muscle cells they switch on contraction, whereas in gland cells they are responsible for regulation of secretion. In many cases Ca2+ signals can control several different processes in the same cell. As an example, we shall deal with one particular cell type, namely the pancreatic acinar cell, which is responsible for the secretion of the enzymes essential for the digestion of food. In this cell, Ca2+ signals do not only control the normal enzyme secretion, but also regulate growth (cell division) and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Until recently, it was a mystery how the same type of signal could regulate such diverse functions in one and the same cell. Recent technical advances have shown that different patterns of Ca2+ signals can be created, in space and time, which allow specific cellular responses to be elicited.",0

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 907 nondemented people 75 years or older, followed up for 6 years to detect incident dementia and AD cases according to the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of dementia and AD by Cox proportional hazards models after controlling for several potential confounders. RESULTS: Subjects who had at least 2 siblings with dementia were at an increased risk of AD. Individuals with both APOE epsilon4 allele and at least 2 affected first-degree relatives had a higher risk of dementia and AD compared with those without these 2 factors. Similar results were obtained for history of dementia separately in parents or siblings. Among the epsilon4 allele carriers, subjects with 2 or more first-degree demented relatives had increased risk of dementia and AD, whereas no increased risk was detected among non-epsilon4 carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Family history of dementia was associated with an increased risk of dementia and AD in this very old population, but only among APOE epsilon4 carriers. This suggests the existence of other genetic or environmental risk factors that may be active in the presence of the APOE epsilon4 allele.",1
27358796,Sparks creating light? Strengthening peripheral disease surveillance in the Democratic Republic of Congo,"SETTING: The Democratic Republic of Congo suffers from an amalgam of disease outbreaks and other medical emergencies. An efficient response to these relies strongly on the national surveillance system. The Pool d'Urgence Congo (PUC, Congo Emergency Team) of Medecins Sans Frontieres is a project that responds to emergencies in highly remote areas through short-term vertical interventions, during which it uses the opportunity of its presence to reinforce the local surveillance system. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the ancillary strengthening of the peripheral surveillance system during short-term interventions leads to improved disease notification. DESIGN: A descriptive paired study measuring disease notification before and after 12 PUC interventions in 2013-2014. RESULTS: A significant increase in disease notification was observed after seven mass-vaccination campaigns and was sustained over 6 months. For the remaining five smaller-scaled interventions, no significant effects were observed. CONCLUSION: The observed improvements after even short-term interventions underline, on the one hand, how external emergency actors can positively affect the system through their punctuated actions, and, on the other hand, the dire need for investment in surveillance at peripheral level.",0
28687741,InSAR constraints on soil moisture evolution after the March 2015 extreme precipitation event in Chile,"ABSTARCT: Constraints on soil moisture can guide agricultural practices, act as input into weather, flooding and climate models and inform water resource policies. Space-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations provide near-global coverage, even in the presence of clouds, of proxies for soil moisture derived from the amplitude and phase content of radar imagery. We describe results from a 1.5 year-long InSAR time series spanning the March, 2015 extreme precipitation event in the hyperarid Atacama desert of Chile, constraining the immediate increase in soil moisture and drying out over the following months, as well as the response to a later, smaller precipitation event. The inferred temporal evolution of soil moisture is remarkably consistent between independent, overlapping SAR tracks covering a region ~100 km in extent. The unusually large rain event, combined with the extensive spatial and temporal coverage of the SAR dataset, present an unprecedented opportunity to image the time-evolution of soil characteristics over different surface types. Constraints on the timescale of shallow water storage after precipitation events are increasingly valuable as global water resources continue to be stretched to their limits and communities continue to develop in flood-prone areas.",0
11129418,Distal gastric cancer and extensive surgery: a new evaluation method based on the study of the status of residual lymph nodes after limited surgery,"BACKGROUND: Curative resection (R0) is the treatment of choice for distal gastric cancer, but it is unclear whether this operation should include a total gastrectomy (TG) with splenectomy and extended (D2) lymph node dissection. A new concept was developed based on the fact that residual metastatic lymph nodes after a limited (D1) subtotal gastrectomy (SG) may be the source of fatal relapse. We conducted a prospective study on patients who had undergone a D2 TG to evaluate whether certain stations left behind after a D1 SG contain metastasis. METHODS: We studied 1207 nodes obtained from 35 eligible patients who underwent a TG within 2 years. Of these patients, 29 fulfilled the criterion for a D2 dissection with curative potential. Numbers of retrieved and tumor-containing nodes by each station according to the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer were documented prospectively in a standardized protocol. All lymph nodes were studied in sections smaller than 2 mm, but emphasis was given to the study of nodes from stations 1 and 2 (paracardial right and left), station 10 (splenic hilum), and stations 7 through 12 (around celiac axis, and in hepatoduodenal ligament) that can be dissected with a TG, splenectomy, and D2 dissection, respectively. For quality control of D2 dissection, the numbers of nodes retrieved by each compartment II nodal station (7-12) documented by a pathologist were used and compared with proposed reference values. Long-term survival and cumulative risk of relapse were calculated in terms of lymph node status and presence of metastasis in compartment II nodes. RESULTS: A mean total node yield of 37.4 from stations 1-12 and 11.4 from compartment II (stations 7-12) was obtained from 29 patients who had a D2 TG with curative intent. A substantial variation in node yields was found, and sometimes several stations contained no lymph nodes, which suggested an important cause of noncompliance (no yield of lymph nodes detected by the pathologist from that indicated for dissection stations) and difficulties for quality control. No positive node was detected in stations 1, 2, and 10 among patients who had a curative TG with splenectomy. However, substantially high was the incidence of metastasis in compartment II nodes, which was detected in one third of patients with node-positive disease. After 10 years of follow-up, overall survival and relapse rates among R0 D2 patients with negative compartment II nodes (pN0/pN1 disease) were 47% and 44%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the necessity of D2 dissection, but not of TG with splenectomy, to achieve an R0 resection for patients with distal gastric carcinoma. A large prospective study based on our protocol and findings may clarify whether a D2 R0 resection would result in a survival benefit.",0
1382994,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria due to hereditary nucleotide deletion in the HRF20 (CD59) gene,"HRF20 (CD59) is a membrane glycoprotein which protects cells from the membrane attack reaction of homologous complement. A patient who is completely deficient in HRF20 expression and is suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) was studied. His parents are cousins and both have decreased HRF20 expression, suggesting that the deficiency is genetic. We established a cultured cell line (NCU1) which is HRF20 deficient from the patient's lymphocytes by Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) infection. Northern blot analysis revealed HRF20 mRNA signals, indicating that HRF20 mRNA were transcribed. HRF20 cDNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Sequencing of the cDNA from the NCU1 showed two single-base deletions at amino acid 16 and 96 from the N terminus of the mature protein. Deletion in the genomic DNA of peripheral blood lymphocytes was confirmed by the DNA sequence of an HRF20 open reading frame containing amino acid 16. Furthermore, the patient's parents and sister possessed both intact and deleted genomic HRF20 DNA while his brother's DNA was intact. These findings demonstrate that the HRF20 deficiency was genomic in origin, and that complete deletion was brought about by a homozygous abnormality in the HRF20 gene. The base deletion caused a codon frame shift resulting in failure to produce intact HRF20 protein in the patient.",1

10071645,Accuracy of right and left ventricular heart volume and left ventricular muscle mass determination with cine MRI in breath holding technique,"PURPOSE: To assess the accuracy of right- (RV) and left-ventricular (LV) heart volume and muscle mass determinations by cine MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten subjects were examined twice by a segmented, ECG-triggered cine sequence in the short axis plane and breath-hold technique by two independent operators and again 4 weeks later by one of the operators. The contours were evaluated manually by two independent examiners and again four weeks later by one of the examiners. LV and RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, stroke volume, cardiac output, ejection fraction (EF), and left-ventricular muscle mass were compared. RESULTS: The RV evaluation variations (RV-EF: 6.46%) were higher than the LV (LV-EF: 4.46%). The intra-examiner variations were smaller than the inter-examiner variations. The generally operators did not cause a significantly increased variation (LV-EF: 5.77%). In contrast, the repeat examinations at different times did lead to a significant increase in the variation (LV-EF: 10.15%). CONCLUSIONS: The rapid ECG-triggered cine MRI in breath-hold technique allows the simultaneous RV and LV, artefact-free determination of heart volumes and LV muscle mass. The LV volumes can be determined more accurately than the RV. The examiner has a distinct influence on the accuracy, the operator has a lesser effect. Physiological fluctuations of cardiac activity significantly influence the follow-up.",0
10218041,Topical corticosteroids in association with miconazole and chlorhexidine in the long-term management of atrophic-erosive oral lichen planus: a placebo-controlled and comparative study between clobetasol and fluocinonide,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a combination of topical corticosteroids with topical antimycotic drugs in the therapy of atrophic-erosive forms of oral lichen planus (OLP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 60 patients with OLP subdivided into three groups matched for sex and age. The first group (25 patients) and the second group (24 patients) received respectively 0.05% clobetasol propionate ointment or 0.05% fluocinonide ointment in an adhesive medium (4% hydroxyethyl cellulose gel) plus in each case antimycotic treatment consisting of miconazole gel and 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwashes. The third group (11 patients), placebo group, received only hydroxyethyl cellulose gel and antimycotic treatment as above. All the treatment regimens were carried out for 6 months. Each patient was examined every 2 months during the 6-month period of active treatment and for a further 6 months of follow-up. Objective and subjective clinical progress was scored and compared between the three groups. Plasma cortisol levels were monitored in half the patients using the topical corticosteroids. RESULTS: All patients treated with clobetasol and 90% of the patients treated with fluocinonide witnessed some improvement, whereas in the placebo group only 20% of patients improved (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.00029, respectively. However, when considering complete responses, only clobetasol gave significantly better results than placebo. Clobetasol resolved 75% of the lesions whereas fluocinonide was effective in 25% of cases and placebo in none. Clobetasol achieved better results statistically than did fluocinonide (P = 0.00442) and placebo (P = 0.00049) whereas there was no statistical difference among fluocinonide and placebo (P = 0.140). Similar results were obtained for symptoms. Both drugs were shown to be effective in the treatment of erosive lesions, but clobetasol was considerably more efficacious than fluocinonide in the atrophic areas (75% vs 25% of total response, respectively) (P = 0.00442). None of the treated patients contracted oropharyngeal candidiasis. After 6 months of follow-up, 65% of the clobetasol-treated group and 55% of the fluocinonide group were stable. Estimation of plasma cortisol levels showed no significant systemic adverse effects of clobetasol or fluocinonide. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a very potent topical corticosteroid such as clobetasol may control OLP in most cases, with no significant adrenal suppression or adverse effects. Moreover, a concomitant antimycotic treatment with miconazole gel and chlorhexidine mouthwashes is a useful and safe prophylaxis against oropharyngeal candidiasis.",0
20026758,Early life stress sensitizes rats to angiotensin II-induced hypertension and vascular inflammation in adult life,"Maternal separation during early life is an established chronic behavioral model of early life stress in rats. It is known that perinatal adverse environments increase activity of the renin-angiotensin (Ang) system, specifically Ang II, in adulthood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the effects of early life stress augment the sensitivity of the Ang II pathway. Using Wistar Kyoto rats, the maternal separation (MS) protocol was performed by separating approximately half of the male pups from their mother 3 h/d from days 2 to 14 of life. Pups remaining with the mother at all times were used as controls. Maternal separation did not influence the plasma basal parameters, such as blood glucose, insulin, Ang II, Ang 1-7 and plasma renin activity. Furthermore, body weight, blood pressure, and heart rate were similar in MS and control rats. The acute pressor response to Ang II was not different in anesthetized MS and control rats. However, the chronic infusion of Ang II (65 ng/min SC) elicited an exaggerated hypertensive response in MS compared with control rats (P<0.05). Surprisingly, HR was dramatically increased during the second week of Ang II infusion in MS compared with control rats (P<0.05). This enhanced Ang II sensitivity was accompanied by a greater vascular inflammatory response in MS versus control rats. Chronic Ang II infusion increased vascular wall structure in both groups similarly. These data indicate that early life stress sensitizes rats to an increased hemodynamic and inflammatory response during Ang II-induced hypertension.",0

11228744,Redox control of Epstein-Barr virus replication by human thioredoxin/ATL-derived factor: differential regulation of lytic and latent infection,"Human thioredoxin (hTRX)/adult T-cell leukemia (ATL)-derived factor (ADF) was originally reported as an interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor-alpha-inducing factor produced by human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1-positive (HTLV-1+) cell lines. Growing evidence indicates that hTRX/ADF plays important roles in cellular responses against oxidative stress and is involved in a variety of cellular functions. A high level of hTRX/ADF expression is also observed in other human virus-infected cell lines including those of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human papillomavirus. In this report, we analyzed the effect of hTRX/ADF on lytic amplification and persistent replication of EBV as a model for lytic versus latent phase of viral replication in host cells. Addition of hTRX/ADF clearly suppressed lytic replication of EBV in Raji cells and B95-8 cells induced to the lytic phase of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and it prevented the death of these cells evoked by the lytic induction. In contrast, hTRX/ADF did not have any effect on persistent replication in the latent phase. These data indicated that hTRX/ADF prevents EBV-transformed cells from proceeding into the lytic phase and regulates cohabitation of EBV and its host cells.",0
30223483,Cytotoxic Tetrahydroxanthone Dimers from the Mangrove-Associated Fungus Aspergillus versicolor HDN1009,"Three new tetrahydroxanthone dimers, 5-epi-asperdichrome (1), versixanthones N (2), and O (3), were isolated from the mangrove-derived fungus Aspergillus versicolor HDN1009. Their structures, including the absolute configurations, were elucidated by NMR, HRMS, and circular dichroism (CD) experiments. Among them, compound 1 was the second example of tetrahydroxanthone dimers, which dimerized by a rare diaryl ether linkage and showed promising antibacterial activities against Vibrio parahemolyticus, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium phlei, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC values ranging from 100 muM to 200 muM; whilst compounds 2 and 3 exhibited extensive cytotoxicities against five cancer cell lines (HL-60, K562, H1975, MGC803, and HO-8910), with IC50 values ranging from 1.7 muM to 16.1 muM.",0
27606716,Carotid ultrasound in the cardiovascular risk stratification of patients with ankylosing spondylitis: results of a population-based study,"OBJECTIVES: To determine if the use of carotid ultrasonography (US) may improve the cardiovascular (CV) risk stratification in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: A set of 127 consecutive patients without history of CV events, diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease that fulfilled definitions for AS according to the 1984 modified New York criteria were recruited to assess carotid intima-media thickness and presence of plaques. CV risk was calculated according to the systematic coronary risk evaluation (SCORE), the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and the Reynolds Risk Score (RRS). RESULTS: Men outnumbered women (61.4%). The mean+/-SD age at the time of the study was 44.5+/-11.6 years. The median (interquartile range-IQR) disease duration was 13 (7-22) years. The median (IQR) BASDAI at the time of the study was 3.65 (1.7- 4.9). HLA-B-27 was positive in 77.2%, and syndesmophytes were present in 38.9%. Carotid plaques were found in 43 (33.9%). Regardless of the algorithm used for CV risk stratification, more than 50% of the patients classified as having moderate CV risk had carotid plaques. Moreover, 20.8%, 24.6% and 53.3% of AS that fulfilled the category of low CV risk according to the total cholesterol (TC)-SCORE, FRS and RRS, respectively had carotid plaques. A model that included patients with a chart TC-SCORE >/=5% or TC-SCORE >/=1% <5% plus carotid plaques or TC-SCORE <1% and CRP >3 mg/L at diagnosis plus syndesmophytes and carotid plaques or TC-SCORE <1% and CRP >3 mg/L at diagnosis plus extraarticular manifestations plus carotid plaques yielded the highest sensitivity (93.0%) for high/very high CV risk in these patients. The presence of syndesmophytes was associated with increased risk of carotid plaques in AS that fulfilled definitions for low CV risk according to the TC-SCORE (OR 8.75 [95% CI 2.11-36.40]; p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of carotid US in the assessment of CV risk in patients with AS.",0
21810191,Effect of niacin on erectile function in men suffering erectile dysfunction and dyslipidemia,"INTRODUCTION: Dyslipidemia is closely related to erectile dysfunction (ED). Evidence has shown that the lipid-lowering agent, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statins), can improve erectile function. However, information about the potential role of another class of lipid-lowering agent, niacin, is unknown. AIM: To assess the effect of niacin alone on erectile function in patients suffering from both ED and dyslipidemia. METHODS: A single center prospective randomized placebo-controlled parallel-group trial was conducted. One hundred sixty male patients with ED and dyslipidemia were randomized in a one-to-one ratio to receive up to 1,500 mg oral niacin daily or placebo for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the improvement in erectile function as assessed by question 3 and question 4 of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF Q3 and Q4). Secondary outcome measurements included the total IIEF score, IIEF-erectile function domain, and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score. RESULTS: From the overall analysis, the niacin group showed a significant increase in both IIEF-Q3 scores (0.53 +/- 1.18, P < 0.001) and IIEF-Q4 scores (0.35 +/- 1.17, P = 0.013) compared with baseline values. The placebo group also showed a significant increase in IIEF-Q3 scores (0.30 +/- 1.16, P = 0.040) but not IIEF-Q4 scores (0.24 +/- 1.13, P = 0.084). However, when patients were stratified according to the baseline severity of ED, the patients with moderate and severe ED who received niacin showed a significant improvement in IIEF-Q3 scores (0.56 +/- 0.96 [P = 0.037] and 1.03 +/- 1.20 [P < 0.001], respectively) and IIEF-Q4 scores (0.56 +/- 1.03 [P = 0.048] and 0.84 +/- 1.05 [P < 0.001], respectively] compared with baseline values, but not for the placebo group. The improvement in IIEF-EF domain score for severe and moderate ED patients in the niacin group were 5.28 +/- 5.94 (P < 0.001) and 3.31 +/- 4.54 (P = 0.014) and in the placebo group were 2.65 +/- 5.63 (P < 0.041) and 2.74 +/- 5.59 (P = 0.027), respectively. There was no significant improvement in erectile function for patients with mild and mild-to-moderate ED for both groups. For patients not receiving statins treatment, there was a significant improvement in IIEF-Q3 scores (0.47 +/- 1.16 [P = 0.004]) for the niacin group, but not for the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Niacin alone can improve the erectile function in patients suffering from moderate to severe ED and dyslipidemia.",0

Nifedipine inhibited the exercise-induced fall in FEV1 almost completely in four patients, offered partial protection in a further nine patients and had no effect in the remaining two patients. It is suggested that mediator release which is dependent on free calcium ions may play an important role in exercise-induced asthma and calcium antagonists may inhibit post-exercise bronchoconstriction by their blocking effect on calcium channels of the mast cells.",0

9100385,"Identification of a pathogenicity locus, rpfA, in Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora subsp. carotovora that encodes a two-component sensor-regulator protein","A mutant of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, AH2552, created by a Mud1 insertion was found to be reduced in plant pathogenicity and deficient in extracellular protease and cellulase activity, although it produced normal levels of pectate lyase and polygalacturonase. A cosmid clone, pEC462, was isolated from a wild-type E. carotovora subsp. carotovora DNA library that concomitantly restored pathogenicity and protease and cellulase activities of AH2552 to wild-type levels when present in trans. The genetic locus that was disrupted in AH2552 by insertion of Mud1 has been designated rpfA, for regulator of pathogenicity factors. Sequencing of the rpfA region identified an open reading frame of 2,787 bp, and the predicted 929-amino acid polypeptide shared high identity with several two-component sensor-regulator proteins: BarA from Escherichia coli, ApdA from Pseudomonas fluorescens, PheN from P. tolaasii, RepA from P. viridiflava, LemA from P. syringae pv. syringae, and RpfC from Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. The RpfA locus described in this study encodes a putative sensor kinase protein that is involved in both extracellular protease and cellulase production and the pathogenicity of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora on potato tubers.",0
32341178,"Nickel Allergic Contact Dermatitis: Identification, Treatment, and Prevention","Nickel is a ubiquitous metal added to jewelry and metallic substances for its hardening properties and because it is inexpensive. Estimates suggest that at least 1.1 million children in the United States are sensitized to nickel. Nickel allergic contact dermatitis (Ni-ACD) is the most common cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction worldwide. The incidence among children tested has almost quadrupled over the past 3 decades. The associated morbidities include itch, discomfort, school absence, and reduced quality of life. In adulthood, individuals with Ni-ACD may have severe disabling hand eczema. The increasing rate of Ni-ACD in children has been postulated to result from early and frequent exposure to metals with high amounts of nickel release (eg, as occurs with ear piercing or with products used daily in childhood such as toys, belt buckles, and electronics).To reduce exposure to metal sources with high nickel release by prolonged and direct contact with human skin, Denmark and the European Union legislated a directive several decades ago with the goal of reducing high nickel release and the incidence of Ni-ACD. Since then, there has been a global reduction in incidence of Ni-ACD in population-based studies of adults and studies of children and young adults being tested for allergic contact dermatitis. These data point to nickel exposure as a trigger for elicitation of Ni-ACD and, further, provide evidence that legislation can have a favorable effect on the economic and medical health of a population.This policy statement reviews the epidemiology, history, and appearances of Ni-ACD. Examples of sources of high nickel release are discussed to highlight how difficult it is to avoid this metal in modern daily lives. Treatments are outlined, and avoidance strategies are presented. Long-term epidemiological interventions are addressed. Advocacy for smarter nickel use is reviewed. The American Academy of Pediatrics supports US legislation that advances safety standards (as modeled by the European Union) that protect children from early and prolonged skin exposure to high-nickel-releasing items. Our final aim for this article is to aid the pediatric community in developing nickel-avoidance strategies on both individual and global levels.",0
11792822,BAF is required for emerin assembly into the reforming nuclear envelope,"Mutations in emerin cause the X-linked recessive form of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). Emerin localizes at the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope (NE) during interphase, and diffuses into the ER when the NE disassembles during mitosis. We analyzed the recruitment of wildtype and mutant GFP-tagged emerin proteins during nuclear envelope assembly in living HeLa cells. During telophase, emerin accumulates briefly at the 'core' region of telophase chromosomes, and later distributes over the entire nuclear rim. Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), a protein that binds nonspecifically to double-stranded DNA in vitro, co-localized with emerin at the 'core' region of chromosomes during telophase. An emerin mutant defective for binding to BAF in vitro failed to localize at the 'core' in vivo, and subsequently failed to localize at the reformed NE. In HeLa cells that expressed BAF mutant G25E, which did not show 'core' localization, the endogenous emerin proteins failed to localize at the 'core' region during telophase, and did not assemble into the NE during the subsequent interphase. BAF mutant G25E also dominantly dislocalized LAP2beta and lamin A from the NE, but had no effect on the localization of lamin B. We conclude that BAF is required for the assembly of emerin and A-type lamins at the reforming NE during telophase, and may mediate their stability in the subsequent interphase.",1
16788063,"Loss of Aif function causes cell death in the mouse embryo, but the temporal progression of patterning is normal","Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is an evolutionarily conserved, ubiquitously expressed flavoprotein with NADH oxidase activity that is normally confined to mitochondria. In mammalian cells, AIF is released from mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli and translocates to the nucleus where it is thought to bind DNA and contribute to chromatinolysis and cell death in a caspase-independent manner. Here we describe the consequences of inactivating Aif in the early mouse embryo. Unexpectedly, we found that both the apoptosis-dependent process of cavitation in embryoid bodies and apoptosis associated with embryonic neural tube closure occur in the absence of AIF, indicating that Aif function is not required for apoptotic cell death in early mouse embryos. By embryonic day 9 (E9), loss of Aif function causes abnormal cell death, presumably because of reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I activity. Because of this cell death, Aif null embryos fail to increase significantly in size after E9. Remarkably, patterning processes continue on an essentially normal schedule, such that E10 Aif null embryos with only approximately 1/10 the normal number of cells have the same somite number as their wild-type littermates. These observations show that pattern formation in the mouse can occur independent of embryo size and cell number.",1
2527801,The Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein maps to human chromosome 21 bands q21.105-q21.05,The Alzheimer amyloid protein precursor (APP) has previously been localized to human chromosome 21q11.2-q21. We have refined the regional localization to a small region including chromosome bands 21q21.105-q21.05 by using quantitative Southern blot analysis of cell lines aneuploid for parts of chromosome 21. Our findings exclude the APP gene from the minimal region producing the classical phenotypic features of Down syndrome. This further narrowing of the APP location will help in identifying the physical location of the gene causing familial Alzheimer disease.,1
1380673,Processing of mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is temperature-sensitive,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a plasma membrane Cl- channel regulated by cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation and by intracellular ATP. Mutations in CFTR cause cystic fibrosis partly through loss of cAMP-regulated Cl- permeability from the plasma membrane of affected epithelia. The most common mutation in cystic fibrosis is deletion of phenylalanine at residue 508 (CFTR delta F508) (ref. 10). Studies on the biosynthesis and localization of CFTR delta F508 indicate that the mutant protein is not processed correctly and, as a result, is not delivered to the plasma membrane. These conclusions are consistent with earlier functional studies which failed to detect cAMP-stimulated Cl- channels in cells expressing CFTR delta F508 (refs 16, 17). Chloride channel activity was detected, however, when CFTR delta F508 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, Vero cells and Sf9 insect cells. Because oocytes and Sf9 cells are typically maintained at lower temperatures than mammalian cells, and because processing of nascent proteins can be sensitive to temperature, we tested the effect of temperature on the processing of CFTR delta F508. Here we show that the processing of CFTR delta F508 reverts towards that of wild-type as the incubation temperature is reduced. When the processing defect is corrected, cAMP-regulated Cl- channels appear in the plasma membrane. These results reconcile previous contradictory observations and suggest that the mutant most commonly associated with cystic fibrosis is temperature-sensitive.",1
11536079,A spectrum of ABCC6 mutations is responsible for pseudoxanthoma elasticum,"To better understand the pathogenetics of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), we performed a mutational analysis of ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 6 (ABCC6) in 122 unrelated patients with PXE, the largest cohort of patients yet studied. Thirty-six mutations were characterized, and, among these, 28 were novel variants (for a total of 43 PXE mutations known to date). Twenty-one alleles were missense variants, six were small insertions or deletions, five were nonsense, two were alleles likely to result in aberrant mRNA splicing, and two were large deletions involving ABCC6. Although most mutations appeared to be unique variants, two disease-causing alleles occurred frequently in apparently unrelated individuals. R1141X was found in our patient cohort at a frequency of 18.8% and was preponderant in European patients. ABCC6del23-29 occurred at a frequency of 12.9% and was prevalent in patients from the United States. These results suggested that R1141X and ABCC6del23-29 might have been derived regionally from founder alleles. Putative disease-causing mutations were identified in approximately 64% of the 244 chromosomes studied, and 85.2% of the 122 patients were found to have at least one disease-causing allele. Our results suggest that a fraction of the undetected mutant alleles could be either genomic rearrangements or mutations occurring in noncoding regions of the ABCC6 gene. The distribution pattern of ABCC6 mutations revealed a cluster of disease-causing variants within exons encoding a large C-terminal cytoplasmic loop and in the C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD2). We discuss the potential structural and functional significance of this mutation pattern within the context of the complex relationship between the PXE phenotype and the function of ABCC6.",1

8827715,Overexpression of select T cell receptor V beta gene families within CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets of myasthenia gravis patients: a role for superantigen(s)?,"BACKGROUND: The principal symptoms of myasthenia gravis (MG), muscle weakness and fatigue due to impaired neuromuscular transmission, are caused by autoantibodies to the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The mechanisms underlying the autoimmune response, however, appear to be initiated by activation of specific HLA class II-restricted CD4+ T lymphocytes. Thus, central to elucidating the causation of MG is determining how T cells are recruited to contribute to misguided immunological assaults on the major autoantigenic target, AChR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By combining a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategy and Southern blot technique, we have analyzed the frequency of expression of 22 individual T cell receptor (TCR) V beta gene subfamilies in CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral blood T cell subsets derived from eight MG patients and seven healthy controls. The quantification of relative usage of individual TCR J beta gene segments was performed by hybridization of PCR-amplified products (specifically V beta 1-C beta) with a complete panel of 32P-5'-end-labeled J beta-specific oligonucleotide probes, followed by scanning analysis of autoradiographs. RESULTS: Comparisons of data obtained from V beta analyses of T cells from MG patients with those from healthy individuals established that MG patients significantly overexpressed V beta 1, V beta 13.2, V beta 17, and V beta 20 gene family members within both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subpopulations. Moreover, analysis of the relative utilization of individual TCR J beta gene segments in V beta 1+/CD4+ and V beta 1+/CD8+ T lymphocytes revealed distribution patterns in patients indistinguishable from those recorded in the corresponding cell subsets derived from controls. CONCLUSIONS: T lymphocytes from MG patients displayed a biased overexpression of four TCR V beta gene segments: V beta 1, V beta 13.2, V beta 17, and V beta 20. The relative frequencies of association of individual V beta 1 (D beta) J beta combinations revealed that J beta gene usage in the V beta 1-over-represented T cell subsets had normal distribution patterns. It can thus be deduced that J beta gene segment products appear not to have a selective effect on the process leading to overexpression of V beta 1 exons in MG patients. Hence, our observations suggest a possible role for superantigen(s) in the T cell activation in MG patients.",0
11254677,CCR6-deficient mice have impaired leukocyte homeostasis and altered contact hypersensitivity and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses,"CCR6 expression in dendritic, T, and B cells suggests that this beta-chemokine receptor may regulate the migration and recruitment of antigen-presenting and immunocompetent cells during inflammatory and immunological responses. Here we demonstrate that CCR6-/- mice have underdeveloped Peyer's patches, in which the myeloid CD11b+ CD11c+ dendritic-cell subset is not present in the subepithelial dome. CCR6-/- mice also have increased numbers in T-cell subpopulations within the intestinal mucosa. In 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene-induced contact hypersensitivity (CHS) studies, CCR6-/- mice developed more severe and more persistent inflammation than wild-type (WT) animals. Conversely, in a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) model induced with allogeneic splenocytes, CCR6-/- mice developed no inflammatory response. The altered responses seen in the CHS and DTH assays suggest the existence of a defect in the activation and/or migration of the CD4(+) T-cell subsets that downregulate or elicit the inflammation response, respectively. These findings underscore the role of CCR6 in cutaneous and intestinal immunity and the utility of CCR6-/- mice as a model to study pathologies in these tissues.

At least one exotoxin was produced by 80% of enteric and 96% of non-enteric isolates. The exotoxin profiles of non-enteric isolates were more restricted than those of enteric isolates, with haemolysin and cytotoxin producers preponderant. Although haemolysin and cytotoxin were produced by isolates from all sources, the enterotoxin and cholera toxin-like factor were more common amongst enteric isolates. The production of haemolysin and cytotoxin were closely related but the association between the enterotoxin and the cholera toxin-like factor was not significant.",0

A lack of detailed case reports is one reason, among others, for this skepticism.

10550050,An adenosine deaminase that generates inosine at the wobble position of tRNAs,"Several transfer RNAs (tRNAs) contain inosine (I) at the first position of their anticodon (position 34); this modification is thought to enlarge the codon recognition capacity during protein synthesis. The tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that forms I(34) in tRNAs is described. The heterodimeric enzyme consists of two sequence-related subunits (Tad2p/ADAT2 and Tad3p/ADAT3), both of which contain cytidine deaminase (CDA) motifs. Each subunit is encoded by an essential gene (TAD2 and TAD3), indicating that I(34) is an indispensable base modification in elongating tRNAs. These results provide an evolutionary link between the CDA superfamily and RNA-dependent adenosine deaminases (ADARs/ADATs).",1

20729865,"Inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 suppresses cocaine seeking by generating THP, a cocaine use-dependent inhibitor of dopamine synthesis","There is no effective treatment for cocaine addiction despite extensive knowledge of the neurobiology of drug addiction. Here we show that a selective aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH-2) inhibitor, ALDH2i, suppresses cocaine self-administration in rats and prevents cocaine- or cue-induced reinstatement in a rat model of cocaine relapse-like behavior. We also identify a molecular mechanism by which ALDH-2 inhibition reduces cocaine-seeking behavior: increases in tetrahydropapaveroline (THP) formation due to inhibition of ALDH-2 decrease cocaine-stimulated dopamine production and release in vitro and in vivo. Cocaine increases extracellular dopamine concentration, which activates dopamine D2 autoreceptors to stimulate cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) in primary ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. PKA and PKC phosphorylate and activate tyrosine hydroxylase, further increasing dopamine synthesis in a positive-feedback loop. Monoamine oxidase converts dopamine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), a substrate for ALDH-2. Inhibition of ALDH-2 enables DOPAL to condense with dopamine to form THP in VTA neurons. THP selectively inhibits phosphorylated (activated) tyrosine hydroxylase to reduce dopamine production via negative-feedback signaling. Reducing cocaine- and craving-associated increases in dopamine release seems to account for the effectiveness of ALDH2i in suppressing cocaine-seeking behavior. Selective inhibition of ALDH-2 may have therapeutic potential for treating human cocaine addiction and preventing relapse.",1
10332630,Immunological cross reactivity between Candida albicans and human tissue,"An old concept to account for autoimmunity is the existence of immunologic cross reactions, or shared determinants between an exogenous agent and self antigen. To study molecular mimicry between the Candida antigen and an autoantigen, sera from clinical specimens were screened, based on seronegativity or positivity for thyroid, ovary and adrenal antibodies. Compared with tissue antibody negative sera and sera from healthy controls, samples from positive tissue antibody subjects exhibited significantly higher levels of Candida IgG (P < 0.001) IgM (P < 0.001) and IgA (P < 0.01) antibodies. While Candida antibodies were elevated in 60% of tissue antibody positive samples, these antibodies were present in only 7.5% of tissue antibody negative subjects and in 10% of healthy controls. Since PAGE electrophoresis showed similar bands mobility in Candida and different tissues, these positive antibodies and rabbit anti Candida antibodies were reacted in immunodiffusion and Western Blot Assay against Candida and tissue antigens, simultaneously. The results of immunodiffusion showed a clear precipitation line against tissue antigens when rabbit anti Candida or human positive Candida serum was used. Similarly, Western Blot Assays with rabbit or human anti Candida serum showed several positive bands with Candida and one or two positive bands with different tissues. The common antigens were located in the regions of 72 and 36 KD. The 72 KD was detected in capsule antigens, placenta, ovary, adrenal, thymus, liver, pancreas, spleen, brain and kidney, but not in sperm or epithelial cell antigen. The 36 KD antigen was positive in placenta, spleen adrenal, pancreas and capsule tissues. Absorbtion of sera containing high levels of Candida antibodies with tissue antigens caused 10-15% reduction in antibody titers. Moreover, treatment of thyroid antibody positive sera with C. Albicans caused a similar reduction in thyroid antibody levels. These reductions in antibody levels are an additional support for cross reactivity between C. Albicans and mammalian tissues. A demonstration of immunological cross reactivity between Candida and human tissues may be associated with the possible pathogenic role of Candida Albicans in the development of autoimmune diseases which warrants further investigation.",0
31790847,Genetic variants affecting bone mineral density and bone mineral content at multiple skeletal sites in Hispanic children,"CONTEXT: Osteoporosis is a major public health burden with significant economic costs. However, the correlates of bone health in Hispanic children are understudied. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) at multiple skeletal sites in Hispanic children. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional genome-wide linkage analysis, genome-wide and exome-wide association analysis of BMD and BMC. The Viva La Familia Study is a family-based cohort with a total of 1030 Hispanic children (4-19 years old at baseline) conducted in Houston, TX. BMD and BMC were measured by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Significant heritability were observed for BMC and BMD at multiple skeletal sites ranging between 44 and 68% (P < 2.8 x 10(-)(9)). Significant evidence for linkage was found for BMD of pelvis and left leg on chromosome 7p14, lumbar spine on 20q13 and left rib on 6p21, and BMC of pelvis on chromosome 20q12 and total body on 14q22-23 (logarithm of odds score > 3). We found genome-wide significant association between BMC of right arm and rs762920 at PVALB (P = 4.6 x 10(-)(8)), and between pelvis BMD and rs7000615 at PTK2B (P = 7.4 x 10(-)(8)). Exome-wide association analysis revealed novel association of variants at MEGF10 and ABRAXAS2 with left arm and lumber spine BMC, respectively (P < 9 x 10(-)(7)). CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel loci associated with BMC and BMD in Hispanic children, with strongest evidence for PTK2B. These findings provide better understanding of bone genetics and shed light on biological mechanisms underlying BMD and BMC variation.",0

Eukaryotic cells can synthesize ubiquinone but not menaquinone, whereas prokaryotes can synthesize both quinones. So far, most of the human gut microbiome (HGM) studies have been based on metagenomic analysis. Here, we applied an analysis of individual HGM genomes to the identification of ubiquinone and menaquinone biosynthetic pathways. In our opinion, the shift from metagenomics to analysis of individual genomes is a pivotal milestone in investigation of bacterial communities, including the HGM. The key results of this study are as follows. (i) The distribution of the canonical pathways in the HGM genomes was consistent with previous reports and with the distribution of the quinone-dependent reductases for electron acceptors. (ii) The comparative genomics analysis identified four alternative forms of the previously known enzymes for quinone biosynthesis. (iii) Genes for the previously unknown part of the futalosine pathway were identified, and the corresponding biochemical reactions were proposed. We discuss the remaining gaps in the menaquinone and ubiquinone pathways in some of the microbes, which indicate the existence of further alternate genes or routes. Together, these findings provide further insight into the biosynthesis of quinones in bacteria and the physiology of the HGM. ",0
6137879,Assignment of structural gene for asparagine synthetase to human chromosome 7,"Somatic cell hybrids obtained from the fusion of human B lymphocytes and an asparagine synthetase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line were isolated after growth in asparagine-free medium. The human and hamster forms of asparagine synthetase differ significantly in their rate of inactivation at 47.5 degrees C. The asparagine synthetase activity expressed in the hybrids was inactivated at 47.5 degrees C at the same rate as the human form of the enzyme. Karyotypic analysis and analysis for chromosome-specific enzyme markers showed that the structural gene for asparagine synthetase is located on chromosome 7 in humans. The heat-inactivation profile for asparagine synthetase in extracts of hybrids formed between human peripheral leukocytes and a hamster cell line expressing asparagine synthetase activity was intermediate between the two parental types when human chromosome 7 was present, but was identical to the hamster parent when chromosome 7 was absent.",1
9302298,Selective expression of the eotaxin receptor CCR3 by human T helper 2 cells,"There is growing evidence that T helper cell subsets (TH1 and TH2) can be differentially recruited to promote different types of inflammatory reactions. Murine TH1 but not TH2 cells are recruited through P- and E-selectin into inflamed tissues, where they induce delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. The human eotaxin-receptor CCR3, originally described on eosinophils and basophils, was also found to be expressed by TH2 cells. An antibody to CCR3 was used to isolate T cells from peripheral blood that give rise to TH2-polarized cell lines and to identify TH2 cells derived from naive T cells in vitro. Eotaxin stimulated increases in intracellular calcium and chemotaxis of CCR3(+) T cells. The attraction of TH2 cells by eotaxin could represent a key mechanism in allergic reactions, because it promotes the allergen-driven production of interleukin-4 and interleukin-5 necessary to activate basophils and eosinophils.",1
3950217,Stability of teacher temperament ratings over 6 and 12 months,"Six and 12-month stability of teacher ratings of temperament was studied in four samples. For the two samples retested after a 6-month interval, the same teacher provided the original and retest ratings. For the two samples retested after a 12-month interval, different teachers provided the retest ratings than provided the original ratings. Four indices of stability were investigated for each sample: cross-rank stability, within-person stability , absolute score stability, and factorial stability. Factorial stability was demonstrated for all samples. For the other three indices of stability, 6-month stability was moderate to high, and significantly higher than the 12-month stability. The general pattern of results is comparable to temperament rating data from parents, with specific coefficients being somewhat higher.",0

25905871,Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of non-covalent complexes formed between N-alkylimidazolium-containing zwitterionic sulfonates and protonated bases,"This paper describes non-covalent complexes between zwitterionic 3-(1-alkyl-3N-imidazolio)- propane-1-sulfonates and different amines. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry and collision- induced dissociation were used to measure the stability of such complexes in solution and in the gas phase. Generally, zwitterionic sulfonates formed more abundant complexes with protonated 5-methylcytosine (5-MCH) than with aliphatic amines. The results show that the association constants and half-dissociation threshold energies of these complexes nonlinearly depend on the alkyl chain length of the zwitterion. It is shown that the complexes with the lowest stability exist in acetonitrile solution or in the gas phase. The factors responsible for this complicated behavior are discussed. The structure of the complexes was investigated by quantum chemical calculations using molecular mechanics and density functional theory. Hydrogen bonding is proposed as the main type of interaction responsible for the stability of ion-zwitterion complexes. In summary, the information obtained in this study could be used for the development of the new derivatization reagents for some compounds containing amidinium groups, like 5-MCH, to increase selectivity of ESI-based methods.

With the aid of cDNA probes for the enzyme, we isolated overlapping lambda clones encompassing the human 12-lipoxygenase gene and flanking regions from a human genomic library. The gene consists of 14 exons with 13 introns and spans approximately 15 kilobases of DNA. All the exon-intron junctions conform to the GT/AG rule. Neither a typical TATA box nor a CAAT box was found in approximately 1-kb sequence of 5'-upstream region of the translation initiation site. However, this region contains several regulatory elements including four GC boxes, two CACCC boxes, three AP-2 binding sequences, and a glucocorticoid-responsive element. The major transcription initiation site was determined by primer-extension analysis as an adenosine residue at 306 bases upstream from the translation initiation codon. The chromosomal localization of the human 12-lipoxygenase gene was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and the gene was assigned to the sub-band p13.1 of chromosome 17.",1

8713776,Safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibody purified factor IX concentrate in previously untreated patients with hemophilia B,"The safety and efficacy of a monoclonal antibody purified factor IX concentrate were evaluated in two continuing trials of 32 previously untreated patients with mild, moderate, or severe hemophilia B. Patients were evaluated every 2 weeks for 24 weeks and every 3 months thereafter for at least 1 year. No patients became positive for human immunodeficiency virus antibody or hepatitis C virus antibody during the trial. Two patients developed a false-positive hepatitis B core antibody, one transiently, but neither had elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). None of the 25 patients evaluable for non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis by strict International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis criteria developed elevated levels of ALT indicative of posttransfusion infection. Anaphylaxis occurred in one subject who also developed an inhibitor to factor IX (19.3 Bethesda units). Five of the eight adverse events reported (63%) were mild in severity, and the relationship of three of these to therapy was considered remote. Hemostasis with monoclonal antibody purified factor IX concentrate was excellent in all patients.",0

Nymphs were exposed for 35 d on a concrete surface treated with 2.3 mg of active ingredient/m2 pyriproxyfen. Exposure to pyriproxyfen significantly reduced the numbers of both adults and nymphs in comparison with untreated controls. In adults, the greatest reduction (> 90%) was for L. decolor and L. bostrychophila, whereas for L. paeta it was 49%. Few adults of any species were found in the pyriproxyfen treatments. The greatest numbers of nymphs were recorded for L. bostrychophila for both pyriproxyfen treatments and controls. Few adults of any species were found in the pyriproxyfen treatments. The results indicate that pyriproxyfen is effective for control of L. bostrychophila, L. decolor, and L. paeta on concrete, and although complete control was not achieved, the results warrant further long-term study to determine whether pyriproxyfen can completely eliminate psocid populations over time.",0

Here we describe the frequency, origin and stability of this mutation in ALS+/-FTD from five European cohorts (total n=1347). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms defining the risk haplotype in linked kindreds were genotyped in cases (n=434) and controls (n=856). Haplotypes were analysed using PLINK and aged using DMLE+. In a London clinic cohort, the HREM was the most common mutation in familial ALS+/-FTD: C9ORF72 29/112 (26%), SOD1 27/112 (24%), TARDBP 1/112 (1%) and FUS 4/112 (4%) and detected in 13/216 (6%) of unselected sporadic ALS cases but was rare in controls (3/856, 0.3%). HREM prevalence was high for familial ALS+/-FTD throughout Europe: Belgium 19/22 (86%), Sweden 30/41 (73%), the Netherlands 10/27 (37%) and Italy 4/20 (20%). The HREM did not affect the age at onset or survival of ALS patients. Haplotype analysis identified a common founder in all 137 HREM carriers that arose around 6300 years ago. The haplotype from which the HREM arose is intrinsically unstable with an increased number of repeats (average 8, compared with 2 for controls, P<10(-8)). We conclude that the HREM has a single founder and is the most common mutation in familial and sporadic ALS in Europe.",1

Overlapping cDNA clones representing a complete 4.7-kilobase mdr1 transcript have been obtained from multidrug-resistant KB cells. Primer extension and S1 nuclease protection experiments show that two transcripts initiate 136 and 140 bases upstream from the first ATG codon in all human multidrug-resistant cell lines. The mdr1 gene is expressed in human normal kidney cells and HepG2 liver cells as a poly(A)+ RNA which starts from the same sites. Less prominent transcripts were found to initiate 155-180 bases upstream from the first ATG codon in vinblastine- or adriamycin-selected cell lines and 480-630 bases upstream in colchicine-selected cell lines. Southern hybridization analyses with different portions of a full-length cDNA indicate that the human mdr1 gene encompasses at least 70 kilobases of DNA amplified in all highly multidrug-resistant cell lines.",1
33126906,Impact of free maternal health care policy on maternal health care utilization and perinatal mortality in Ghana: protocol design for historical cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Ghana introduced what has come to be known as the 'Free' Maternal Health Care Policy (FMHCP) in 2008 via the free registration of pregnant women to the National Health Insurance Scheme to access healthcare free of charge. The policy targeted every pregnant woman in Ghana with a full benefits package covering comprehensive maternal healthcare. PURPOSE: This study seeks to measure the contribution of the FMHCP to maternal healthcare utilization; antenatal care uptake, and facility delivery and determine the utilization impact on stillbirth, perinatal, and neonatal deaths using quasi-experimental methods. The study will also contextualize the findings against funding constraints and operational bottlenecks surrounding the policy operations in the Upper East Region of Ghana. METHODS: This study adopts a mixed-method design to estimate the treatment effect using variables generated from historical data of Ghana and Kenya Demographic and Health Survey data sets of 2008/2014, as treatment and comparison groups respectively. As DHS uses complex design, weighting will be applied to the data sets to cater for clustering and stratification at all stages of the analysis by setting the data in STATA and prefix Stata commands with 'svy'. Thus, the policy impact will be determined using quasi-experimental designs; propensity score matching, and difference-in-differences methods. Prevalence, mean difference, and test of association between outcome and exposure variables will be achieved using the Rao Scot Chi-square. Confounding variables will be adjusted for using Poisson and multiple logistics regression models. Statistical results will be reported in proportions, regression coefficient, and risk ratios. This study then employs intrinsic-case study technique to explore the current operations of the 'free' policy in Ghana, using qualitative methods to obtain primary data from the Upper East Region of Ghana for an in-depth analysis. DISCUSSION: The study discussions will show the contributions of the 'free' policy towards maternal healthcare utilization and its performance towards stillbirth, perinatal and neonatal healthcare outcomes. The discussions will also centre on policy designs and implementation in resource constraints settings showing how SDG3 can be achievement or otherwise. Effectiveness of policy proxy and gains in the context of social health insurance within a broader concept of population health and economic burden will also be conferred. PROTOCOL APPROVAL: This study protocol is registered for implementation by the Ghana Health Service Ethical Review Committee, number: GHS-ERC 002/04/19.",0

Therefore, inhibition caspase-1 may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we have reported structure-based design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivatives (6a-6w) as potential caspase-1 inhibitors. Six compounds 6m, 6n, 6o, 6p, 6q and 6r showed significant enzymatic inhibition with IC50 ranging from 0.022 to 0.078microM. These compounds also displayed excellent cellular potency at sub-micromolar concentration. Moreover, molecular docking studies provided the useful binding insights specific for caspase-1 inhibition. All these results indicated that compounds 6m, 6n and 6o could be potential leads for the development of newer caspase-1 inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents.",0

Fast-growing tumours, N+ greater than 3, showed a prognosis significantly worse (P less than 0.01) than that of slow-growing tumours of the same class; no significant differences were found among N- or N+ (1-3) fast-, intermediate- and slow-growing tumours. Highly significant differences were found among fast- and intermediate-growing tumours with different degrees of lymph node involvement (respectively P less than 0.0001 and P less than 0.001), with the worst prognosis for N+ greater than 3 tumours. In contrast, no significant differences were found among slow-growing tumours of the different N classes. When the Cox model was applied, the relationship between lymph node involvement and doubling time was significant, as was the interaction term. It is suggested that growth rate and metastatic potential are not the same in primary breast cancers, and their relation should be investigated.",0

All of the phytoconstituents in the formulation have been tested individually but this is the first study where such a formulation has been evaluated against chemotherapy-induced cognitive decline (CICD) in a mouse model. CICD was induced by cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg), methotrexate (5 mg/kg), and 5-fluorouracil (5 mg/kg) (CMF), administered intraperitonially. CMF was administered in three cycles, with one injection per week for three weeks. The decline in cognition of the mice was evaluated by a test of locomotor activity (Open Field Test) followed by a test for spatial memory (Morris Water Maze). Biochemical parameters evaluated include brain cytokine levels and BDNF levels via ELISA. Hematological counts were also performed to evaluate any changes in blood profile using a veterinary blood cell counter. Levels of oxidative stress markers with respect to catalase activity and lipid peroxidation were also evaluated in the brain using UV-spectrophotometric analysis. Mulmina was able to show significant improvement in cognitive function post chemotherapy when compared to the untreated animals. Apart from improvement in spatial memory, there was also an improvement in biochemical parameters. The particular combination of phytochemicals in Mulmina proved themselves successful in alleviating the CICD in this preliminary study and pave a path for future studies which can establish the solid grounds with respect to molecular and pharmacological basis for the mechanism of action of Mulmina.",0
3188859,Knot strength of cerclage bands and wires,"I compared the knot strength of loop- and twist-knotted cerclage wires, and Parham and CPC bands, using a knot-slip resistance test. Two twist-knot devices and one loop-knot device were used to apply cerclage wires, and a band clamp was used to apply bands to a 5-cm-diameter split circular jaw mounted on a tensile testing machine. For all the wire sizes tested, the twisted knot provided greater resistance to knot failure than did the loop knot. Knot resistance increased with increase in wire size for all the devices tested. Neither band produced knot-slip resistance as great as 1.2-mm twist-knotted wire.",0
23525150,Comparative proteomic analysis of ductal breast carcinoma demonstrates an altered expression of chaperonins and cytoskeletal proteins,"The aim of the present study was to analyze the protein composition of ductal breast carcinoma and the surrounding normal tissue in individual patients using comparative 2D proteomics and mass spectrometry to detect candidate disease biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. Samples of normal and cancerous tissue obtained form 28 patients were analyzed. Chaperonins and cytoskeletal proteins predominated among the 11 proteins for which major changes in abundance were detected. Of these 11 proteins with an altered expression, 2 had a decreased expression and 9 had an increased expression. In addition, the abundance of a few cytokeratins was also altered; however, they were not capable of serving as specific circulatory biomarkers. The proteins which we observed to exhibit an altered expression in infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma may be exploited as novel targets for therapeutic interventions or represent novel diagnostic/prognostic markers for the early detection of aggressive tumors, particularly those with multridrug-resistant phenotypes during the earlier stages of the disease.",0
12010880,Novel human and mouse genes encoding an acid phosphatase family member and its downregulation in W/W(V) mouse jejunum,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are pacemakers and mediators of motor neurotransmission in gastrointestinal smooth muscles. ICC require cellular signalling via Kit, a receptor tyrosine kinase, for development and maintenance of phenotype. Much of the evidence demonstrating the functions of ICC comes from studies of W/W(V) mice, which have reduced Kit function and reductions in specific populations of ICC. The aim of the present study was to differentially examine gene expression in the small intestines of wild-type and W/W(V) mutant mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: RNA from the jejunums of wild-type and W/W(V) mutants was analysed using a differential gene display method. Eighteen queries were identified as novel genes that were differentially displayed in wild-type and W/W(V) mice. One candidate gene, encoding a novel acid phosphatase-like protein, was significantly suppressed in fed and starved W/W(V) mice. The full length clone of the murine gene and its human counterpart were designated acid phosphatase-like protein 1 (ACPL1). Human ACPL1 cDNA encodes a protein of 428 amino acids with homology to human prostatic acid phosphatase protein. This gene is located at 1q21. ACPL1 was abundantly expressed in the human small intestine and colon. Gene products were found to be cytoplasmic in transfected COS-7 cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed expression of ACPL1 mRNA within single isolated ICCs. CONCLUSIONS: Gene analysis showed that ACPL1 was differentially expressed in the small intestines of normal and W/W(V) mice. ICC within the small intestine expressed mRNA for ACPL1. Specific downregulation of ACPL1 in the jejunums of W/W(V) mice and high expression in human intestinal tissue suggest that the ACPL1 gene could be associated with ICC function in mice and humans.",1

10531067,Apoptosis of T cells mediated by Ca2+-induced release of the transcription factor MEF2,"T cell receptor (TCR)-induced apoptosis of thymocytes is mediated by calcium-dependent expression of the steroid receptors Nur77 and Nor1. Nur77 expression is controlled by the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), but how MEF2 is activated by calcium signaling is still obscure. Cabin1, a calcineurin inhibitor, was found to regulate MEF2. MEF2 was normally sequestered by Cabin1 in a transcriptionally inactive state. TCR engagement led to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration and the dissociation of MEF2 from Cabin1, as a result of competitive binding of activated calmodulin to Cabin1. The interplay between Cabin1, MEF2, and calmodulin defines a distinct signaling pathway from the TCR to the Nur77 promoter during T cell apoptosis.",1
11321598,"Cytokeratin, vimentin and E-cadherin immunodetection in the embryonic palate in two strains of mice with different susceptibility to glucocorticoid-induced clefting","An immunohistochemical study analyzing the pattern of distribution of some intermediate filament proteins, keratin and vimentin and, one adhesion molecule, cadherin in different stages of developing secondary palate in two strains of mice with different H-2 backgrounds was undertaken to investigate differences between a strain that is susceptible to glucocorticoid-induced cleft palate (A/Sn) and one that is resistant to glucocorticoid-induced cleft palate (C57/BL). The heads of embryos were processed by standard immunohistochemistry with antipancytokeratin (KAE1), antikeratins 18 (K18) and 19 (K19), antivimentin, and anti E-cadherin antibodies. Immunostaining with KAE1 antibody showed differences between the strains. The reaction was stronger in the medial edge epithelia of palatal processes in the A/Sn strain at all stages of palatogenesis. The C57/BL strain showed a weak immunostain to KAE1. Antivimentin antibody stained the mesenchymal cells of palatal processes and K18 and K19 showed no reaction in either strain of mice. Anti E-cadherin antibody was detected in the medial palatal epithelium of both strains of mice and in all stages of palate development. No differences were observed in E-cadherin and vimentin immunostain in palatal epithelium between the strains. The different expression of some cytokeratins in the embryonic palatal epithelium suggests that these intermediate filament proteins may be involved in different susceptibility to glucocorticoid-induced cleft palate in the mouse. The decreased immunoreaction of cytokeratins observed in the resistant strain would facilitate the disappearance of this molecule during the transformation from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype that takes place during the development of the palate. These results may be related to the loss of cytokeratin expression observed during epithelial-mesenchymal transformation in the embryonic palate.",1
29227198,Novel platinum compounds and nanoparticles as anticancer agents,"Since the approval of cisplatin in 1979, platinum-based drugs have been regularly used in cancer chemotherapy as a first-line treatment or with the combination of other nonplatinum drugs. Subsequent approval of second- and third-generation drugs such as carboplatin and oxaliplatin respectively, has widened the therapeutic achievement of platinum compounds. There are few other platinum drugs approved recently and many other new drugs as well as the formulations of the old ones are going through clinical trials now. Considering the astonishing achievement of these drugs, analyses on the overall scenario of the patent applications on platinum compounds have become the priority to the scientific community. This review summarizes the published patent applications on the novel platinum anticancer compounds from 2012 to 2017 (August).",0
1280732,"Effects of a cardiotonic quinolinone derivative Y-20487 on the isoproterenol-induced positive inotropic action and cyclic AMP accumulation in rat ventricular myocardium: comparison with rolipram, Ro 20-1724, milrinone, and isobutylmethylxanthine","The effect of a new cardiotonic agent Y-20487 [6-(3,6-dihydro-2-oxo-2H-1,3,4-thiadiazin-5-yl)-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)- quinolinone] on cyclic AMP levels of rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and the contractile force of papillary muscles was investigated in comparison with selective cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, milrinone (PDE-III selective), rolipram and Ro 20-1724 (PDE-IV selective), and a nonselective inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Rolipram and Ro 20-1724 did not elicit cyclic AMP accumulation and positive inotropy, but they potentiated the isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cyclic AMP accumulation more effectively than IBMX. Rolipram was more effective than Ro 20-1724 in enhancing ISO-induced cyclic AMP accumulation but was less effective in enhancing the ISO-induced positive inotropic effect, indicating that these agents produce a differential action on cyclic AMP metabolism and inotropy. Milrinone and Y-20487 elicited cyclic AMP accumulation and positive inotropy by themselves. Whereas milrinone scarcely affected the ISO-induced effects, Y-20487 shifted the concentration-response curve for the positive inotropic effect of ISO to the left to the same extent that IBMX did. Y-20487, however, was much less effective than IBMX in enhancing the ISO-induced cyclic AMP accumulation. The present results indicate that in rat ventricular myocardium, PDE-IV may play a crucial role in breakdown of cyclic AMP generated by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, whereas other types of PDE isoenzymes, including PDE-III, may be responsible for the cyclic AMP accumulation and direct positive inotropic effect induced by PDE inhibitors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
20042384,Regulation of compaction initiation in mouse embryo,"Developmental events in preimplantation mouse embryos include the first cleavage, the activation of the embryonic genome, the compaction of the blastomeres to form morula (MO), and the formation of the blastocyst (BL). Compaction, the first cell differentiation event in mammalian development, occurs at the late eight-cell stage in the mouse and may be described in terms of some types of morphological change, which involve reorganization within a cell and intercellular reorganization. Surface microvilli became restricted to a few basal sites and to an externally facing (apical) pole. Prior to compaction, the blastomeres are spherical and lack specialized intercellular junctions. During compaction, the cells were flattened against one another, thus maximizing intercellular contact and obscuring intercellular boundaries. It is believed that the events of compaction have an important influence on the processes involved in blastocyst formation, namely the initiation of inner cell mass and trophectoderm differentiation. The inner cell mass will form the future embryo proper, whereas the trophectoderm cells will form only extraembryonic tissues. Compaction is initiated by E-cadherin mediated cell adhesion, which is regulated post-translationally via protein kinase C. With E-cadherin knock-out, maternal E-cadherin is able to mediate the compaction process at the morula stage. Initial adhesion is mediated by homophilic interactions between E-cadherin extracellular domains.In this review, we attempted to describe this process in detail.",0
23721764,"Lymphovascular invasion, ureteral reimplantation and prior history of urothelial carcinoma are associated with poor prognosis after partial cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer with negative pelvic lymph nodes","PURPOSE: To identify predictive factors underlying recurrence and survival after partial cystectomy for pelvic lymph node-negative muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) (urothelial carcinoma) and to report the results of partial cystectomy among select patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 101 cases that received partial cystectomy for MIBC (pT2-3N0M0) between 2000 and 2010. The log-rank test and a Cox regression analyses were performed to identify factors that were predictive of recurrence and survival. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 53.0 months (range 9-120), the 5-year overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 58%, 65% and 50%, respectively. A total of 33 patients died of bladder cancer and 52 patients survived with intact bladder. Of the 101 patients included, 55 had no recurrence, 12 had non-muscle-invasive recurrence in the bladder that was treated successfully, and 34 had recurrence with advanced disease. The multivariate analysis showed that prior history of urothelial carcinoma (PH.UC) was associated with both CSS and RFS and weakly associated with OS; lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and ureteral reimplantation (UR) were associated with OS, CSS and RFS. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with pelvic lymph node-negative MIBC, PH.UC and UR should be considered as contraindications for partial cystectomy, and LVI is predictive of poor outcomes after partial cystectomy. Highly selective partial cystectomy is a rational alternative to radical cystectomy for the treatment of MIBC with negative pelvic lymph nodes.",0
6202424,A variant form of beta-actin in a mutant of KB cells resistant to cytochalasin B,Lines of KB cells resistant to cytochalasin B have been isolated and characterized. The mutant Cyt 1 exhibits increased cross-resistance to cytochalasin E. Cyt 1 cells bind less cytochalasin B than parental KB cells. Two-dimensional gel analysis shows that Cyt 1 cells carry an alteration in beta-actin. This is further confirmed by one-dimensional peptide analysis. The altered beta-actin (beta'-actin) is synthesized when poly(A)+ RNA from Cyt 1 cells is translated in a reticulocyte-cell-free translation system. These results suggest that the primary site of action of cytochalasin B on cellular motility processes is beta-actin.,1
22935193,The gut microbiome of kittens is affected by dietary protein:carbohydrate ratio and associated with blood metabolite and hormone concentrations,"High-protein, low-carbohydrate (HPLC) diets are common in cats, but their effect on the gut microbiome has been ignored. The present study was conducted to test the effects of dietary protein:carbohydrate ratio on the gut microbiota of growing kittens. Male domestic shorthair kittens were raised by mothers fed moderate-protein, moderate-carbohydrate (MPMC; n 7) or HPLC (n 7) diets, and then weaned at 8 weeks onto the same diet. Fresh faeces were collected at 8, 12 and 16 weeks; DNA was extracted, followed by amplification of the V4-V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene using 454 pyrosequencing. A total of 384 588 sequences (average of 9374 per sample) were generated. Dual hierarchical clustering indicated distinct clustering based on the protein:carbohydrate ratio regardless of age. The protein:carbohydrate ratio affected faecal bacteria. Faecal Actinobacteria were greater (P< 0.05) and Fusobacteria were lower (P< 0.05) in MPMC-fed kittens. Faecal Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Blautia and Eubacterium were greater (P< 0.05) in HPLC-fed kittens, while Dialister, Acidaminococcus, Bifidobacterium, Megasphaera and Mitsuokella were greater (P< 0.05) in MPMC-fed kittens. Principal component analysis of faecal bacteria and blood metabolites and hormones resulted in distinct clusters. Of particular interest was the clustering of blood TAG with faecal Clostridiaceae, Eubacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Fusobacteriaceae and Lachnospiraceae; blood ghrelin with faecal Coriobacteriaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae and Veillonellaceae; and blood glucose, cholesterol and leptin with faecal Lactobacillaceae. The present results demonstrate that the protein:carbohydrate ratio affects the faecal microbiome, and highlight the associations between faecal microbes and circulating hormones and metabolites that may be important in terms of satiety and host metabolism.",0
11283620,Mutations in the APC tumour suppressor gene cause chromosomal instability,"Two forms of genetic instability have been described in colorectal cancer: microsatellite instability and chromosomal instability. Microsatellite instability results from mutations in mismatch repair genes; chromosomal instability is the hallmark of many colorectal cancers, although it is not completely understood at the molecular level. As truncations of the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene are found in most colorectal tumours, we thought that mutations in APC might be responsible for chromosomal instability. To test this hypothesis, we examined mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells homozygous for Min (multiple intestinal neoplasia) or Apc1638T alleles. Here we show that Apc mutant ES cells display extensive chromosome and spindle aberrations, providing genetic evidence for a role of APC in chromosome segregation. Consistent with this, APC accumulates at the kinetochore during mitosis. Apc mutant cells form mitotic spindles with an abundance of microtubules that inefficiently connect with kinetochores. This phenotype is recapitulated by the induced expression of a 253-amino-acid carboxy-terminal fragment of APC in microsatellite unstable colorectal cancer cells. We conclude that loss of APC sequences that lie C-terminal to the beta-catenin regulatory domain contributes to chromosomal instability in colorectal cancer.",1
16932808,"Casq2 deletion causes sarcoplasmic reticulum volume increase, premature Ca2+ release, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia","Cardiac calsequestrin (Casq2) is thought to be the key sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ storage protein essential for SR Ca2+ release in mammalian heart. Human CASQ2 mutations are associated with catecholaminergic ventricular tachycardia. However, homozygous mutation carriers presumably lacking functional Casq2 display surprisingly normal cardiac contractility. Here we show that Casq2-null mice are viable and display normal SR Ca2+ release and contractile function under basal conditions. The mice exhibited striking increases in SR volume and near absence of the Casq2-binding proteins triadin-1 and junctin; upregulation of other Ca2+ -binding proteins was not apparent. Exposure to catecholamines in Casq2-null myocytes caused increased diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, resulting in premature spontaneous SR Ca2+ releases and triggered beats. In vivo, Casq2-null mice phenocopied the human arrhythmias. Thus, while the unique molecular and anatomic adaptive response to Casq2 deletion maintains functional SR Ca2+ storage, lack of Casq2 also causes increased diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, rendering Casq2-null mice susceptible to catecholaminergic ventricular arrhythmias.",1
10653020,Levels of alpha- and beta-secretase cleaved amyloid precursor protein in the cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's disease patients,"Alternative cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) results in generation and secretion of both soluble APP (sAPP) and beta-amyloid (Abeta). Abeta is the main component of the amyloid depositions in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Using Western blotting, we compared the levels of alpha-secretase cleaved sAPP, beta-secretase cleaved sAPP and total sAPP, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 13 sporadic AD patients and 13 healthy controls. Our findings show significant amounts of beta-secretase cleaved sAPP in CSF. There was no statistically significant difference in the levels of beta-secretase cleaved sAPP between AD patients and controls. The levels of alpha-secretase cleaved sAPP and total sAPP were, however, found to be significantly lower in the AD patients than in the controls.",1
9849891,Phosphorylation site independent single R-domain mutations affect CFTR channel activity,"We investigated CFTR channel activity of mature R-domain mutants showing single alterations at sites other than the predicted phosphorylation sites. All mutations were found in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (H620Q, E822K and E826K). The macroscopic CFTR chloride conductance induced by phosphorylation was significantly enhanced in Xenopus oocytes injected with mRNA of H620Q but reduced in the E822K and E826K mutants compared to wild type CFTR. The anion permeability sequence for all three mutants was the same as that of wild type CFTR. Cell attached single channel studies in COS cells revealed that both open channel probability and/or the number of functional channels were either higher (H620Q) or lower (E822K and E826K) than in wild type CFTR. Single channel conductances were unchanged in all mutants. Our results suggest that additional sites in the R-domain other than phosphorylation sites influence gating of CFTR channels.",1

The translocation involved very small terminal segments. The unbalanced products resulting in partial trisomy 20q and monosomy 3p were observed in the retarded subjects. Gene localisation studies of the ADA gene, with a presumed locus on the long arm of chromosome 20, were also carried out and seem to exclude this gene from the distal part of 20q (20q13.1----qter).",1
30365212,A comparison of global coagulation assays between normal controls and patients with thrombocytopenia,"INTRODUCTION: Some patients with thrombocytopenia may be at risk of bleeding although quantitative platelet count is not always a sufficient predictive factor. Global coagulation assays such as thromboelastography (TEG((R)) ), calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT) and overall haemostatic potential (OHP) may provide a better assessment of an individual's haemostatic profile. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from thrombocytopenic patients. TEG((R)) was performed on citrated whole blood, while CAT and OHP were performed on platelet-poor plasma. Results were compared to our previously collected normal controls. RESULTS: Fifty-eight participants (24 immune thrombocytopenia, 34 chemotherapy/malignancy-related) with mean age of 57.5 years were recruited. Compared to normal controls, thrombocytopenic participants had comparable maximum amplitude but reduced clot lysis (0.0% vs 0.6%; P < 0.001) on TEG((R)) with reduced endogenous thrombin potential on CAT (1252.2 vs 1353.0 nmol/L/min; P = 0.040). No differences were seen in the OHP parameters. TEG((R)) showed significant difference between marked and mild thrombocytopenia groups with minimal differences seen on CAT and OHP. Those with marked thrombocytopenia showed reduced maximum amplitude (47.2 vs 57.8 mm; P = 0.002) as expected while participants with mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100-150 x 10(9) /L) paradoxically demonstrated increased maximum amplitude (66.4 vs 57.8 mm; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Global coagulation assays, particularly TEG((R)) , can detect subtle differences in coagulation in thrombocytopenic patients. While patients with marked thrombocytopenia showed reduced maximum amplitude, patients with mild thrombocytopenia appear to paradoxically show increased maximum amplitude, suggesting compensatory activity within the coagulation pathway which may in part explain why not all thrombocytopenic patients have bleeding complications.",0
20132244,Novel and recurrent p14 mutations in Italian familial melanoma,"CDKN2A and CDK4 are the only known high-penetrant genes conferring proneness to cutaneous melanoma. The CDKN2A locus consists of four exons and encodes several alternate transcripts, two of which are p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), and originate from different open reading frames. Exon 1alpha is specific for p16(INK4a), while exon 1beta characterizes p14(ARF). Most CDKN2A mutations are located in exons 1alpha and 2, while exon 1beta variations have been identified in rare melanoma-prone pedigrees. In a previous study, we investigated 155 Italian melanoma cases, including 94 familial melanomas (FAMs) and 61 sporadic multiple primary melanomas (MPMs), for p16(INK4a)/CDK4 germline alterations and identified 15 p16(INK4a) and 1 CDK4 point mutations. In the present work, we extended our search to p14(ARF) mutations and CDKN2A deletions in the remaining samples. We identified the recurrent g.193+1G> A mutation in two FAM cases, while an additional pedigree displayed the previously undescribed variant g.161G> A. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) screening for copy variations resulted negative in all cases. In Italy, the overall frequency of p14(ARF) mutations is 3.2% in FAM and 0% in sporadic MPM. Re-evaluation of our patients' cohort emphasizes that the chance of identifying CDKN2A/CDK4 mutations in FAM is mainly influenced by the number of affected family members and the presence of one or more MPM cases. Accordingly, mutation rate rises to 61% in selected cases. Further studies are expected in order to investigate CDKN2A rarer mutations, including atypical deletions and inherited epimutations.",1
20941092,Split of surface plasmon resonance of gold nanoparticles on silicon substrate: a study of dielectric functions,The split of surface plasmon resonance of self-assembled gold nanoparticles on Si substrate is observed from the dielectric functions of the nanoparticles. The split plasmon resonances are modeled with two Lorentz oscillators: one oscillator at ~1 eV models the polarization parallel to the substrate while the other at ~2 eV represents the polarization perpendicular to the substrate. Both parallel and perpendicular resonances are red-shifted when the nanoparticle size increases. The red shifts in both resonances are explained by the image charge effect of the Si substrate.,0
12509412,Effects of mutations of ABCA1 in the first extracellular domain on subcellular trafficking and ATP binding/hydrolysis,"ABCA1 mediates release of cellular cholesterol and phospholipid to form high density lipoprotein (HDL). The three different mutants in the first extracellular domain of human ABCA1 associated with Tangier disease, R587W, W590S, and Q597R, were examined for their subcellular localization and function by using ABCA1-GFP fusion protein stably expressed in HEK293 cells. ABCA1-GFP expressed in HEK293 was fully functional for apoA-I-mediated HDL assembly. Immunostaining and confocal microscopic analyses demonstrated that ABCA1-GFP was mainly localized to the plasma membrane (PM) but also substantially in intracellular compartments. All three mutant ABCA1-GFPs showed no or little apoA-I-mediated HDL assembly. R587W and Q597R were associated with impaired processing of oligosaccharide from high mannose type to complex type and failed to be localized to the PM, whereas W590S did not show such dysfunctions. Vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping was examined to elucidate the mechanism for the dysfunction in the W590S mutant. Photoaffinity labeling of W590S with 8-azido-[alpha-(32)P]ATP was stimulated by adding ortho-vanadate in the presence of Mn(2+) as much as in the presence of wild-type ABCA1. These results suggest that the defect of HDL assembly in R587W and Q597R is due to the impaired localization to the PM, whereas W590S has a functional defect other than the initial ATP binding and hydrolysis.",1
22298428,The Ankrd 13 family of UIM-bearing proteins regulates EGF receptor endocytosis from the plasma membrane,"The mechanism of ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis of cell surface proteins is not completely understood. Here we examine the role of the ankyrin repeat domain (Ankrd) 13A, 13B, and 13D proteins, which constitute a functionally unknown family of ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)-bearing proteins, in the process. Stimulation of human HeLa cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) rapidly induced direct binding of Ankrd 13 proteins to ubiquitinated EGF receptor (EGFR) via the UIMs. The binding was inhibited when the Ankrd 13 proteins underwent UIM-dependent monoubiquitination, suggesting that their activity is regulated by ubiquitination of themselves. Ankrd 13 proteins bound specifically to Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains, which was consistent with a previous report that EGFR mainly undergoes Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination. Ankrd 13 proteins were anchored, via the central region and UIMs, to the plasma membrane, where they colocalized with EGFR. Finally, overexpression of wild-type as well as truncated-mutant Ankrd 13 proteins strongly inhibited rapid endocytosis of ubiquitinated EGFR from the surface in EGF-treated cells. We conclude that by binding to the Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin moiety of EGFR at the plasma membrane, Ankrd 13 proteins regulate the rapid internalization of ligand-activated EGFR.",1
2936465,Two Ca2+ ATPase genes: homologies and mechanistic implications of deduced amino acid sequences,"Rabbit genomic DNA contains two genes that encode Ca2+ ATPases of fast twitch and of slow twitch (and cardiac) sarcoplasmic reticulum, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of the products of the two genes are highly conserved in putative Ca2+ binding regions, in sectors leading from cytoplasmic domains into transmembrane domains, and in transmembrane helices. A transport mechanism is proposed in which Ca2+ binds to negatively charged groups on amphipathic stalk sectors, becoming occluded during enzyme phosphorylation by bound ATP. Rotation of the stalk sectors is induced as the energy in the phosphorylated enzyme (E1P) is utilized in conformational changes leading to the low energy form, E2P. Rotation leads to disruption of high affinity Ca2+ binding sites and release of Ca2+ into a charge-lined membrane channel. Ca2+ then traverses the membrane by exchange diffusion.",1
15770227,"Novel mutations in BCOR in three patients with oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome, but none in Lenz microphthalmia syndrome","Oculo-facio-cardio-dental (OFCD) syndrome is a rare X-linked dominant condition with male lethality characterized by microphthalmia, congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphic features, congenital heart defects, and dental anomalies. Mutations in BCOR (BCL6 co-repressor) located in Xp11.4 have been described to cause OFCD syndrome. Lenz microphthalmia syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern comprising microphthalmia/anophthalmia, mental retardation, malformed ears, digital, skeletal, and urogenital anomalies (synonym: microphthalmia with associated anomalies (MAA)). One locus for MAA has been mapped to Xq27-q28. Nonetheless, linkage and subsequent mutation analysis revealed a single missense mutation (p.P85L) in BCOR in a large family with presumed Lenz microphthalmia syndrome (MAA2). We describe novel mutations in BCOR in three patients with OFCD syndrome, two small deletions (c.2488_2489delAG and c.3286delG) and a submicroscopic deletion of about 60 kb encompassing at least BCOR exons 2-15. No BCOR mutation was detected in eight patients with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome. Our data confirm that BCOR is the causative gene for OFCD syndrome; however, the failure to identify any mutation in patients with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome together with the oligosymptomatic phenotype in the reported MAA2 patients suggest that BCOR is not the major gene for this syndrome.",1
3441523,The sleeping and waking states of infants: correlations across time and person,"Study of the sleeping and waking states of infants was extended to the time domain by analyzing their temporal covariation over a 4-week interval using the intra-person correlation coefficient. As a methodological question, inter-person and intra-person correlation matrices were compared. Twenty-eight fullterm, normal infants were observed in the home weekly from 2 to 5 weeks of age. Over each 7-hour observation, the following states were recorded every 10 seconds: Alert, Non-Alert Waking Activity, Fussing, Crying, Daze, Drowse, Sleep-Wake Transition, Active Sleep, Quiet Sleep, and Unclassified Sleep (sleep during periods of the day when a mother was holding her baby). Data were obtained in two social contexts: when the baby was with the mother and when alone. Significant individual differences were found for each of the states in both social contexts. When the baby was alone, there were a greater number of intra-person correlations than inter-person correlations. All correlations between the waking states and Active Sleep or Quiet Sleep were negative, suggesting the hypothesis that the underlying neurobiological mechanisms may allow a degree of substitution among coupled sleep and wake states. This is an extension of the original hypothesis by Roffwarg, Muzio, and Dement. There were fewer systematic relationships among the states when the babies were with their mother in comparison with periods when they were alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0

To facilitate the identification of candidate genes we have sublocalized and ordered 39 ESTs assigned to this interval by radiation hybrid mapping. This was achieved by generating PAC contigs containing the ESTs, genetic markers, and random STSs. For full integration into previously published data a single YAC contig spanning 6p23-p25 was used to unambiguously order the PAC contigs and ESTs along the chromosome. The majority of the ESTs (31/39) were positioned in the 6p23-p24 interval at the proximal half of the map, and of these 8 are located within a single PAC clone. The order of known genes in this region is cen-CD83-ZNF40-EDN1-(GCNT2, CAPZB)-TFAP2-BMP6-DSP-tel.",1
6988707,Genetic analysis of gamma-ray mutagenesis in yeast. III. Double-mutant strains,"Comparisons between the 60Co gamma-ray survival curves of diploid strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are homozygous for two non-allelic radiation-sensitive mutations and the corresponding single-mutant diploids suggest that there are two main types of repair of ionizing radiation damage in this organism. The first, which is defined by the rad52 epistasis group, depends on the activities of the RAD50 through RAD57 genes and is responsible for repairing the larger amount of lethal damage. Previous work [22] shows that this type of repair is essentially error-free. The second, defined by the rad6 epistasis group, depends on the activities of the RAD6, RAD9, RAD18, REV1 and REV3 genes and repairs a smaller, though still substantial, amount of lethal damage. It is also responsible for induced mutagenesis [22, 23]. Data for survival and mutation induction after irradiation in air and partial anoxia show that oxygen-dependent damage can be repaired by either of these two pathways. They also show similar oxygen-enhancement ratios for survival and mutagenesis.",0
17158447,Glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphorylates CdGAP at a consensus ERK 1 regulatory site,"Rho GTPases regulate a multitude of cellular processes from cytoskeletal reorganization to gene transcription and are negatively regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein (CdGAP) is a ubiquitously expressed GAP for Rac1 and Cdc42. In this study, we set out to identify CdGAP-binding partners and, using a yeast two-hybrid approach, glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha (GSK-3alpha) was identified as a partner for CdGAP. GSK-3 exists in two isoforms, alpha and beta, and is involved in regulating many cellular functions from insulin response to tumorigenesis. We show that GSK-3alpha and -beta interact with CdGAP in mammalian cells. We also demonstrate that GSK-3 phosphorylates CdGAP both in vitro and in vivo on Thr-776, which we have previously shown to be an ERK 1/2 phosphorylation site involved in CdGAP regulation. We report that the mRNA and protein levels of CdGAP are increased upon serum stimulation and that GSK-3 activity is necessary for the up-regulation of the protein levels of CdGAP but not for the increase in mRNA. We conclude that GSK-3 is an important regulator of CdGAP and that regulation of CdGAP protein levels by serum presents a novel mechanism for cells to control Cdc42/Rac1 GTPase signaling pathways.",1
32055648,"VEGFD Protects Retinal Ganglion Cells and, consequently, Capillaries against Excitotoxic Injury","In the central nervous system, neurons and the vasculature influence each other. While it is well described that a functional vascular system is trophic to neurons and that vascular damage contributes to neurodegeneration, the opposite scenario in which neural damage might impact the microvasculature is less defined. In this study, using an in vivo excitotoxic approach in adult mice as a tool to cause specific damage to retinal ganglion cells, we detected subsequent damage to endothelial cells in retinal capillaries. Furthermore, we detected decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGFD) in retinal ganglion cells. In vivo VEGFD supplementation via neuronal-specific viral-mediated expression or acute intravitreal delivery of the mature protein preserved the structural and functional integrity of retinal ganglion cells against excitotoxicity and, additionally, spared endothelial cells from degeneration. Viral-mediated suppression of expression of the VEGFD-binding receptor VEGFR3 in retinal ganglion cells revealed that VEGFD exerts its protective capacity directly on retinal ganglion cells, while protection of endothelial cells is the result of upheld neuronal integrity. These findings suggest that VEGFD supplementation might be a novel, clinically applicable approach for neuronal and vascular protection.",0
18337722,Opposing effects of polyglutamine expansion on native protein complexes contribute to SCA1,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a glutamine-encoding repeat in ataxin 1 (ATXN1). In all known polyglutamine diseases, the glutamine expansion confers toxic functions onto the protein; however, the mechanism by which this occurs remains enigmatic, in light of the fact that the mutant protein apparently maintains interactions with its usual partners. Here we show that the expanded polyglutamine tract differentially affects the function of the host protein in the context of different endogenous protein complexes. Polyglutamine expansion in ATXN1 favours the formation of a particular protein complex containing RBM17, contributing to SCA1 neuropathology by means of a gain-of-function mechanism. Concomitantly, polyglutamine expansion attenuates the formation and function of another protein complex containing ATXN1 and capicua, contributing to SCA1 through a partial loss-of-function mechanism. This model provides mechanistic insight into the molecular pathogenesis of SCA1 as well as other polyglutamine diseases.",1
8799128,"The redox/DNA repair protein, Ref-1, is essential for early embryonic development in mice","The DNA-binding activity of AP-1 proteins is modulated, in vitro, by a posttranslational mechanism involving reduction oxidation. This mode of regulation has been proposed to control both the transcriptional activity and the oncogenic potential of Fos and Jun. Previous studies revealed that reduction of oxidized Fos and Jun by a cellular protein, Ref-1, stimulates sequence-specific AP-1 DNA-binding activity. Ref-1, a bifunctional protein, is also capable of initiating the repair of apurinic/apyrymidinic sites in damaged DNA. The relationship between the redox and DNA repair activities of Ref-1 is intriguing; both activities have been suggested to play an important role in the cellular response to oxidative stress. To investigate the physiological function of Ref-1, we used a gene targeting strategy to generate mice lacking a functional ref-1 gene. We report here that heterozygous mutant mice develop into adulthood without any apparent abnormalities. In contrast, homozygous mutant mice, lacking a functional ref-1 gene, die during embryonic development. Detailed analysis indicates that death occurs following blastocyst formation, shortly after the time of implantation. Degeneration of the mutant embryos is clearly evident at embryonic day 5.5. These findings demonstrate that Ref-1 is essential for early embryonic development.",1
2339692,"Identification of a frameshift mutation responsible for the silent phenotype of human serum cholinesterase, Gly 117 (GGT----GGAG)","A frameshift mutation that causes a silent phenotype for human serum cholinesterase was identified in the DNA of seven individuals of two unrelated families. The mutation, identified using the polymerase chain reaction, causes a shift in the reading frame from Gly 117, where GGT (Gly)----GGAG (Gly+ 1 base) to a new stop codon created at position 129. This alteration is upstream of the active site (Ser 198), and, if any protein were made, it would represent only 22% of the mature enzyme found in normal serum. Results of analysis of the enzymatic activities in serum agreed with the genotypes inferred from the nucleotide sequence. Rocket immunoelectrophoresis using alpha-naphthyl acetate to detect enzymatic activity showed an absence of cross-reactive material, as expected. One additional individual with a silent phenotype did not show the same frameshift mutation. This was not unexpected, since there must be considerable molecular heterogeneity involved in causes for the silent cholinesterase phenotype. This is the first report of a molecular mechanism underlying the silent phenotype for serum cholinesterase. The analytical approach used was similar to the one we recently employed to identify the mutation that causes the atypical cholinesterase variant.",1

25962671,Combined Preclinical Magnetic Particle Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Initial Results in Mice,"PURPOSE: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a new radiologic imaging modality. For the first time, a commercial preclinical scanner is installed. The goal of this study was to establish a workflow between MPI and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners for a complete in vivo examination of a mouse and to generate the first co-registered in vivo MR-MP images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vivo examination of five mice were performed on a preclinical MPI scanner and a 7 Tesla preclinical MRI system. MRI measurements were used for anatomical referencing and validation of the injection of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles during a dynamic MPI scan. We extracted MPI data of the injection phase and co-registered it with MRI data. RESULTS: A workflow process for a combined in vivo MRI and MPI examination was established. A successful injection of ferucarbotran was proven in MPI and MRI. MR-MPI co-registration allocated the SPIOs in the inferior vena cava and the heart during and shortly after the injection. CONCLUSION: The acquisition of preclinical MPI and MRI data is feasible and allows the combined analysis of MR-MPI information.",0
28469040,Mutations in the vesicular trafficking protein annexin A11 are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder. We screened 751 familial ALS patient whole-exome sequences and identified six mutations including p.D40G in the ANXA11 gene in 13 individuals. The p.D40G mutation was absent from 70,000 control whole-exome sequences. This mutation segregated with disease in two kindreds and was present in another two unrelated cases (P = 0.0102), and all mutation carriers shared a common founder haplotype. Annexin A11-positive protein aggregates were abundant in spinal cord motor neurons and hippocampal neuronal axons in an ALS patient carrying the p.D40G mutation. Transfected human embryonic kidney cells expressing ANXA11 with the p.D40G mutation and other N-terminal mutations showed altered binding to calcyclin, and the p.R235Q mutant protein formed insoluble aggregates. We conclude that mutations in ANXA11 are associated with ALS and implicate defective intracellular protein trafficking in disease pathogenesis.",1
10958651,SCA8 CTG repeat: en masse contractions in sperm and intergenerational sequence changes may play a role in reduced penetrance,"We recently described an untranslated CTG expansion that causes a previously undescribed form of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA8). The SCA8 CTG repeat is preceded by a polymorphic but stable CTA tract, with the configuration (CTA)(1-21)(CTG)(n). The CTG portion of the repeat is elongated on pathogenic alleles, which nearly always change in size when transmitted from generation to generation. To better understand the reduced penetrance and maternal penetrance bias associated with SCA8 we analyzed the sequence configurations and instability patterns of the CTG repeat in affected and unaffected family members. In contrast to other triplet repeat diseases, expanded alleles found in affected SCA8 individuals can have either a pure uninterrupted CTG repeat tract or an allele with one or more CCG, CTA, CTC, CCA or CTT interruptions. Surprisingly, we found six different sequence configurations of the CTG repeat on expanded alleles in a seven generation family. In two instances duplication of CCG interruptions occurred over a single generation and in other instances duplications that had occurred in different branches of the family could be inferred. We also evaluated SCA8 instability in sperm samples from individuals with expansions ranging in size from 80 to 800 repeats in blood. Surprisingly the SCA8 repeat tract in sperm underwent contractions, with nearly all of the resulting expanded alleles having repeat lengths of <100 CTGs, a size that is not often associated with disease. These en masse repeat contractions in sperm likely underlie the reduced penetrance associated with paternal transmission.",1
25756500,Inhibition of Bcl-2 sensitizes mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening in ischemia-damaged mitochondria,"BACKGROUND: Mitochondria are critical to cardiac injury during reperfusion as a result of damage sustained during ischemia, including the loss of bcl-2. We asked if bcl-2 depletion not only leads to selective permeation of the outer mitochondrial membrane (MOMP) favoring cytochrome c release and programmed cell death, but also favors opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). An increase in MPTP susceptibility would support a role for bcl-2 depletion mediated cell death in the calcium overload setting of early reperfusion via MPTP as well as later in reperfusion via MOMP as myocardial calcium content normalizes. METHODS: Calcium retention capacity (CRC) was used to reflect the sensitivity of the MPTP opening in isolated cardiac mitochondria. To study the relationship between bcl-2 inhibition and MPTP opening, mitochondria were incubated with a bcl-2 inhibitor (HA14-1) and CRC measured. The contribution of preserved bcl-2 content to MPTP opening following ischemia-reperfusion was explored using transgenic bcl-2 overexpressed mice. RESULTS: CRC was decreased in mitochondria following reperfusion compared to ischemia alone, indicating that reperfusion further sensitizes to MPTP opening. Incubation of ischemia-damaged mitochondria with increasing HA14-1concentrations increased calcium-stimulated MPTP opening, supporting that functional inhibition of bcl-2 during simulated reperfusion favors MPTP opening. Moreover, HA14-1 sensitivity was increased by ischemia compared to non-ischemic controls. Overexpression of bcl-2 attenuated MPTP opening in following ischemia-reperfusion. HA14-1 inhibition also increased the permeability of the outer membrane in the absence of exogenous calcium, indicating that bcl-2 inhibition favors MOMP when calcium is low. CONCLUSIONS: The depletion and functional inhibition of bcl-2 contributes to cardiac injury by increasing susceptibility to MPTP opening in high calcium environments and MOMP in the absence of calcium overload. Thus, ischemia-damaged mitochondria with decreased bcl-2 content are susceptible to MPTP opening in early reperfusion and MOMP later in reperfusion when cytosolic calcium has normalized.",0
25335338,Effect of curcumin on caspase-12 and apoptosis in pulmonary ischemia/reperfusion injury mice,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of curcumin (CUR) on cycteinyl aspirate specific protease-12 (Caspase-12) and pneumocyte apoptosis in pulmonary ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury mice. METHODS: The in vivo unilateral in situ pulmonary I/R injury mouse model was established in C57BL/6J mice. Sixty experimental mice were randomly divided into six groups by random digit table, i. e., the sham-operation group (Sham), the I/R group, the I/R + dimethyl sulfoxide group (I/R + DMSO), the I/R + low dose CUR pre-treated group (I/R + CUR-100), the I/R + middle dose CUR pre-treated group (I/R + CUR-150), the I/R + high dose CUR pre-treated group (I/R + CUR-200), 10 in each group. Mice were euthanized and their left lungs were excised. Wet lung weight to dry lung weight (W/D) and the total lung water content (TLW) were tested. The morphological changes of the lung tissue were observed and index of quantitative evaluation for alveolar damage (IQA) detected under light microscope. The ultra-microstructure of the lung tissue was observed under electron microscope. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Caspase-12 and glucose regulated protein (GRP78) were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. Apoptosis index (AI) of the lung tissue was determined by terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. RESULTS: Compared with the Sham group, expression levels of Caspase-12, GRP78 mRNA and protein all significantly increased in the I/R group (P < 0.05); W/D, TLW, IQA, and AI were all notably higher (P < 0.05, P < 0.01); the morphological and ultrastructural injury of the lung tissue were notably observed in I/R group. Compared with the I/R + DMSO group, expression levels of GRP78 mRNA and protein were increasingly higher in the I/R + CUR-100 group, the I/R + CUR-150 group, and the I/R +CUR-200 group (P < 0.05), expression levels of Caspase-12 mRNA and protein were lower (P < 0.05); W/D, TLW, IQA, and AI also decreased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01); the morphological and ultrastructural injury of the lung tissue were gradually alleviated in the I/R + CUR groups. CONCLUSION: CUR had better effect on the lung protection against I/R injury, which might be related to inhibition for pneumocyte apoptosis associated with Caspase-12 in excessive unfolded protein response (UPR).",0
15026335,A polymorphism in the CDKN1B gene is associated with increased risk of hereditary prostate cancer,"The loss of cell cycle control is believed to be an important mechanism in the promotion of carcinogenesis. CDKN1B (p27) belongs to the Cip/Kip family and functions as an important cell cycle gatekeeper. Several lines of evidence from clinical studies and laboratory experiments demonstrate that CDKN1B is an important tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer etiology. In addition, a case-control study has shown that the 326T/G (V109G) polymorphism in CDKN1B is associated with advanced prostate cancer. In light of the evidence for linkage between the chromosomal location of the CDKN1B gene (12p13) and prostate cancer susceptibility in several hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) populations, we hypothesized that sequence variants of CDKN1B play a role in HPC. To test this hypothesis, we first resequenced this gene in 96 HPC probands to identify germ-line mutations and sequence variants. We then genotyped the identified sequence variants among all family members of 188 HPC families and tested for their cosegregation with prostate cancer. In total, 10 sequence variants were identified, including three nonsynonymous changes. A family-based test, which is free from the effects of population stratification, revealed a significant association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -79C/T and prostate cancer (with a nominal P of 0.0005). The C allele of -79C/T was overtransmitted from parents to their affected offspring. Evidence for this association was primarily contributed by affected offspring whose age at diagnosis was <65 years. Together with the previous association study in a sporadic prostate cancer population, our new findings additionally suggest that germ-line variants of this gene play a role in prostate cancer susceptibility.",1
18604523,Influence of beta-Endorphin on anxious behavior in mice: interaction with EtOH,"RATIONALE: The opioid peptide beta-endorphin (beta-E) is synthesized by the pro-opiomelanocortin gene in response to environmental stressors and alcohol administration and is implicated in the behavioral sequelae associated with these stimuli. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the influence of beta-E on the stress response by evaluating basal measures of anxiety as well as on EtOH-induced anxiolytic behavior using transgenic mice that differ with respect to beta-E. METHODS: Anxious behavior was evaluated for male and female heterozygous, wild-type, and beta-E knockout mice using the Light-Dark Box and Plus Maze assays. Subsequent tests evaluated behavior 20 min after administration of intraperitoneal saline or EtOH (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g/kg). RESULTS: We observed a direct relationship between beta-E levels and the percentage of entries into open arms of the Plus Maze as well as the time spent in either the open arms or the light compartment of the Light-Dark box during basal conditions, suggesting that this peptide normally inhibits anxious behavior. However, mice lacking beta-E demonstrated an exaggerated anxiolytic response to EtOH in these assays. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that beta-E moderates the response to stressful stimuli and supports the hypothesis that this peptide influences the behavioral effects of EtOH.",0
20157635,Migraine in affectively ill Mexican adolescents,"The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine the prevalence of migraine headache among depressed Latino adolescents of Mexican American origin. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study of the prevalence of migraine among depressed adolescents of any ethnic/racial background. In a mental health clinic for the indigent, 132 consecutive Latino adolescents fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode were compared with a sample of adolescents with other mental disorders. Logistic regression was used to test for associations and control for confounding effects. The prevalence of migraine headache among depressed adolescents was 6 times greater than that of the comparison patients (OR = 5.98, z = 2.35, p = 0.019). This finding is consistent with previously published reports involving adult samples, in which the prevalence of migraine was found to exceed that in the general population. However, contrary to what we previously found in Latino adults, the prevalence of migraine was not higher in bipolar than in unipolar adolescents.",0
12782654,"Dwarfism, impaired skin development, skeletal muscle atrophy, delayed bone development, and impeded adipogenesis in mice lacking Akt1 and Akt2","To elucidate the functions of the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB in vivo, we generated mice lacking both akt1 and akt2 genes. Akt1/Akt2 double-knockout (DKO) mice exhibit severe growth deficiency and die shortly after birth. These mice display impaired skin development because of a proliferation defect, severe skeletal muscle atrophy because of a marked decrease in individual muscle cell size, and impaired bone development. These defects are strikingly similar to the phenotypes of IGF-1 receptor-deficient mice and suggest that Akt may serve as the most critical downstream effector of the IGF-1 receptor during development. In addition, Akt1/Akt2 DKO mice display impeded adipogenesis. Specifically, Akt1 and Akt2 are required for the induced expression of PPARgamma, the master regulator of adipogenesis, establishing a new essential role for Akt in adipocyte differentiation. Overall, the combined deletion of Akt1 and Akt2 establishes in vivo roles for Akt in cell proliferation, growth, and differentiation. These functions of Akt were uncovered despite the observed lower level of Akt activity mediated by Akt3 in Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells, suggesting that a critical threshold level of Akt activity is required to maintain normal cell proliferation, growth, and differentiation.",1
11092760,The Menkes copper transporter is required for the activation of tyrosinase,"Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive copper deficiency disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7A (MNK) gene. The MNK gene encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, MNK, which is localized predominantly in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The MNK protein relocates to the plasma membrane in cells exposed to elevated copper where it functions in copper efflux. A role for MNK at the TGN in mammalian cells has not been demonstrated. In this study, we investigated whether the MNK protein is required for the activity of tyrosinase, a copper-dependent enzyme involved in melanogenesis that is synthesized within the secretory pathway. We demonstrate that recombinant tyrosinase expressed in immortalized Menkes fibroblast cell lines was inactive, whereas in normal fibroblasts known to express MNK protein there was substantial tyrosinase activity. Co-expression of the Menkes protein and tyrosinase from plasmid constructs in Menkes fibroblasts led to the activation of tyrosinase and melanogenesis. This MNK-dependent activation of tyrosinase was impaired by the chelation of copper in the medium of cells and after mutation of the invariant phosphorylation site at aspartic acid residue 1044 of MNK. Collectively, these findings suggest that the MNK protein transports copper into the secretory pathway of mammalian cells to activate copper-dependent enzymes and reveal a second copper transport role for MNK in mammalian cells. These findings describe a single cell-based system that allows both the copper transport and trafficking functions of MNK to be studied. This study also contributes to our understanding of the molecular basis of pigmentation in mammalian cells.",1
31258721,UBE2C overexpression in melanoma and its essential role in G2/M transition,"Ubiquitinconjugating enzyme E2C (UBE2C) is a key regulator of cell cycle progression, and its aberrant expression has been implicated in various malignancies. However, its clinical and biological roles in malignant melanoma is still unclear. In this study, we found a significant high expression level of UBE2C in melanoma by an in silico analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, which was further validated using fresh melanoma samples. The KM plotter showed that UBE2C level was statistically related to the overall survival (OS) of melanoma patients (p<0.01). RNA interference of UBE2C inhibited the growth of melanoma cells via deactivating ERK/Akt signaling pathways, and blocked the G2/M transition through downregulation of both the level and the activity of mitosis promoting factor (MPF), triggering the apoptosis of melanoma cells. Further, silencing of UBE2C significantly inhibited the xenografted tumor growth on nude mice, indicating an important role of UBE2C in melanoma growth in vivo. Together, our results show that UBE2C may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker as well as a potential therapeutic target for melanoma.",0
17088546,Angiopoietin-like protein 4 converts lipoprotein lipase to inactive monomers and modulates lipase activity in adipose tissue,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) has a central role in lipoprotein metabolism to maintain normal lipoprotein levels in blood and, through tissue specific regulation of its activity, to determine when and in what tissues triglycerides are unloaded. Recent data indicate that angiopoietin-like protein (Angptl)-4 inhibits LPL and retards lipoprotein catabolism. We demonstrate here that the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Angptl-4 binds transiently to LPL and that the interaction results in conversion of the enzyme from catalytically active dimers to inactive, but still folded, monomers with decreased affinity for heparin. Inactivation occurred with less than equimolar ratios of Angptl-4 to LPL, was strongly temperature-dependent, and did not consume the Angptl-4. Furthermore, we show that Angptl-4 mRNA in rat adipose tissue turns over rapidly and that changes in the Angptl-4 mRNA abundance are inversely correlated to LPL activity, both during the fed-to-fasted and fasted-to-fed transitions. We conclude that Angptl-4 is a fasting-induced controller of LPL in adipose tissue, acting extracellularly on the native conformation in an unusual fashion, like an unfolding molecular chaperone.",1
10221464,Identification and cloning of putative human neuronal voltage-gated calcium channel gamma-2 and gamma-3 subunits: neurologic implications,"OBJECTIVE: To identify human genes encoding neuronal voltage-gated calcium channel gamma subunits corresponding to the gamma subunit recently described in mice with hereditary epilepsy, confirm their expression in adult brain, and determine whether a gamma subunit resides in human chromosomal regions with marker genes linked to convulsions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human homologues of a recently described mouse gamma subunit were sought by a computerized search of National Center for Biotechnology Information databases. Sequences of interest were mapped electronically to specific chromosomal regions. The proximity of these chromosomal regions to markers linked to convulsive disorders was determined by a MEDLINE search. Predicted gamma subunit sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a human adult brain complementary DNA (cDNA) library and were subcloned, and full-length sequences were determined or confirmed. Secondary structure and transmembrane regions were predicted by using the TMpredict program. RESULTS: Two putative isoforms (human gamma-2 and gamma-3 calcium channel subunits) were identified, cloned, and sequenced. They mapped to chromosomes 22 and 16, respectively. A marker very close to the gamma-3 gene gives maximal lod scores for an autosomal dominant syndrome of familial infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis. CONCLUSION: Genomic DNA sequence data already existed in GenBank (partial for gamma-2 and complete for gamma-3) for the two putative neuronal calcium channel gamma subunits that we identified. By cloning both of these molecules from a cerebellar cDNA library, we demonstrated for the first time their expression in human brain. The gamma-3 gene is adjacent to a marker for a convulsive disorder. The convulsive phenotype of gamma channelopathies occurring in mice makes the human gamma subunit genes attractive candidate genes for hereditary convulsive disorders.",1
17326097,Argininosuccinate lyase deficiency: mutational spectrum in Italian patients and identification of a novel ASL pseudogene,"Argininosuccinic aciduria (ASAuria) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) gene, which leads to the accumulation of argininosuccinic acid (ASA) in body fluids and severe hyperammonemia. A severe neonatal form and a milder late-onset variant are described. We report a novel ASL pseudogene located in the centromeric region of chromosome 7, 14 novel mutations in the ASL gene, and a novel intronic polymorphism found in a cohort of Italian patients. Our approach relied exclusively on genomic DNA analysis. We found seven missense mutations, two nonsense, three small insertions/deletions, and two splicing mutations. Only two patients harbored previously described mutations, and among the novel variants only two were present in more than one kindred. The pathogenicity of the splicing mutations was demonstrated by a functional splicing assay that employed a hybrid minigene. We also performed molecular modeling using the reported three-dimensional structure of ASL to predict the functional consequences of the missense mutations. There was no genotype-phenotype correlation. Patients with neonatal onset display developmental delay and seizures despite adequate metabolic control. Moreover, hepatomegaly, fibrosis, and abnormal liver function tests are common complications in these patients, but not in patients with the late infancy form. We stress the importance of mutation analysis in patients with ASAuria, to confirm the clinical diagnosis, and to perform DNA-based prenatal diagnosis in future pregnancies of these families.",1
19690175,Chemical interrogation of FOXO3a nuclear translocation identifies potent and selective inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinases,"Activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is one the most frequent genetic events in human cancer. A cell-based imaging assay that monitored the translocation of the Akt effector protein, Forkhead box O (FOXO), from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was employed to screen a collection of 33,992 small molecules. The positive compounds were used to screen kinases known to be involved in FOXO translocation. Pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives were found to be potent FOXO relocators as well as biochemical inhibitors of PI3Kalpha. A combination of virtual screening and molecular modeling led to the development of a structure-activity relationship, which indicated the preferred substituents on the pyrazolopyrimidine scaffold. This leads to the synthesis of ETP-45658, which is a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinases and demonstrates mechanism of action in tumor cell lines and in vivo in treated mice.",0

7540613,"Molecular characterization of NDP52, a novel protein of the nuclear domain 10, which is redistributed upon virus infection and interferon treatment","The nuclear domain (ND)10 also described as POD or Kr bodies is involved in the development of acute promyelocytic leukemia and virus-host interactions. Immunofluorescence analysis using a variety of human autoimmune sera and monoclonal antibodies showed a typical dot like nuclear staining for ND10, suggesting that this structure consists of several proteins. Two of the ND10 proteins, Sp100 and PML are genetically characterized and show homology with several transcription factors. Here we describe NDP52, an additional novel protein of the ND10. We raised a new mAb C8A2, that specifically recognizes NDP52. Immunofluorescence analysis using this mAb showed a typical nuclear dot staining as it was described for ND10. Isolation and sequencing of the corresponding cDNA revealed that NDP52 has a predicted molecular mass of 52 kD. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibits an extended central coiled coil domain containing a leucine zipper motif. The COOH terminus of NDP52 shows homology with LIM domains, that have recently been described to mediate protein interactions, which let NDP52 appear as a suitable candidate for mediating interactions between ND10 proteins. In vivo, NDP52 is transcribed in all human tissues analyzed. Furthermore, we show that NDP52 colocalizes with the ND10 protein PML and can be redistributed upon viral infection and interferon treatment. These data suggest that ND10 proteins play an important role in the viral life cycle.",1
11941370,"Mutation of ALMS1, a large gene with a tandem repeat encoding 47 amino acids, causes Alstrom syndrome","Alstrom syndrome (OMIM 203800) is an autosomal recessive disease, characterized by cone-rod retinal dystrophy, cardiomyopathy and type 2 diabetes mellitus, that has been mapped to chromosome 2p13 (refs 1-5). We have studied an individual with Alstrom syndrome carrying a familial balanced reciprocal chromosome translocation (46, XY,t(2;11)(p13;q21)mat) involving the previously implicated critical region. We postulated that this individual was a compound heterozygote, carrying one copy of a gene disrupted by the translocation and the other copy disrupted by an intragenic mutation. We mapped the 2p13 breakpoint on the maternal allele to a genomic fragment of 1.7 kb which contains exon 4 and the start of exon 5 of a newly discovered gene (ALMS1); we detected a frameshift mutation in the paternal copy of the gene. The 12.9-kb transcript of ALMS1 encodes a protein of 4,169 amino acids whose function is unknown. The protein contains a large tandem-repeat domain comprising 34 imperfect repetitions of 47 amino acids. We have detected six different mutations (two nonsense and four frameshift mutations causing premature stop codons) in seven families, confirming that ALMS1 is the gene underlying Alstrom syndrome. We believe that ALMS1 is the first human disease gene characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance to be identified as a result of a balanced reciprocal translocation.",1
24979153,Effects of duodenal switch alone or in combination with sleeve gastrectomy on body weight and lipid metabolism in rats,"BACKGROUND: A combined procedure of sleeve gastrectomy and duodenal switch (SG+DS) has been applied to the treatment of super obesity. The aim of the present study was to test whether duodenal switch alone (DS) leads to similar weight loss and changes in lipid metabolism as SG+DS. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent sham surgery (Sham, N=7), duodenal switch alone (DS, N=5) or sleeve gastrectomy followed by duodenal switch (SG+DS, N=5). Body weight, feed and water intakes, and ambulatory activity were recorded 2 months post surgery. Tissue and faecal lipids, faecal bile acids, plasma cytokines and lipid metabolism-related gene expression in adipose tissue and liver were analysed. RESULTS: Daily energy intake, relative feed uptake, ambulatory activity and body weight reduction were similar between DS and SG+DS rats. The hepatic triacylglycerol content was higher and faecal secretion of triacylglycerol was lower after SG+DS compared to DS (P<0.05). Faecal bile acid secretion was higher in SG+DS than in DS rats (P<0.05) despite similar hepatic CYP7A1mRNA level. Plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and tumour necrosis factor alpha were higher in SG+DS than in DS rats (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although DS and SG+DS had similar efficacy in terms of body weight loss, SG+DS resulted in a poorer regulation of lipid metabolism than DS.",0
7902134,Protein and DNA sequence analysis of a 'private' genetic variant: albumin Ortonovo (Glu-505-->Lys),"Albumin Ortonovo is a slow moving variant of human serum albumin which has been found only in people coming from the small villages of Ortonovo and Nicola (Liguria, Italy) and reaches polymorphic frequency (> or = 1%) in the poorly admixed population group living in that area. This is the first report of a 'private' variant detected in a Caucasian population. It probably originated as a mutation in a founder individual many generations ago. Isoelectric focusing analysis of CNBr fragments from the purified variant localized the mutation in fragment CNBr VI (residues 447-548). This fragment was isolated on a preparative scale by reversed-phase HPLC and subjected to V8 proteinase digestion. Sequence analysis of the abnormal V8 peptide revealed that the variant arises from a previously unreported substitution at position 505 where glutamic acid has been replaced by lysine. The protein data were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis which indicated a single nucleotide change of GAA-->AAA in the corresponding codon of the structural gene. Since the amino acid substitution found in albumin Ortonovo accords with its electrophoretic mobility on cellulose acetate, residue 505 is probably exposed to the solvent. The clustering of the mutations in the intersubdomain connection linking subdomains IIIA and IIIB (residues 492-511) accords with the fact that this region lies on the molecular surface and is accessible to solvent.",1
18823936,The role of respiration in the activation of photosynthesis upon illumination of dark adapted Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,"It is reported that O(2) is required for the activation of photosynthesis in dark adapted Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in State 1, under low light intensity. The concentration of dissolved O(2) of ca. 9 microM is sufficient to saturate the requirement. When the concentration of O(2) is 3 muM or below, the activation of photosynthesis is strongly inhibited by myxothiazol, a specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1). The effect of this inhibitor decreases as the O(2) concentration is raised, to disappear completely above 50 muM. Low concentrations of uncouplers delay the activation of photosynthesis, but do not inhibit it when steady state is reached. It is concluded that in State 1 C. reinhardtii mitochondrial respiration is required for the activation of photosynthesis upon illumination of dark adapted cells only when the concentration of O(2) is too low (less than 5 muM) to allow an appreciable activity of the Mehler reaction. The role of respiration does not seem to be due to the synthesis of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, because photosynthesis activation is not sensitive to oligomycin.",0
7543026,"LDL receptor-related protein, a multifunctional ApoE receptor, binds secreted beta-amyloid precursor protein and mediates its degradation","The secreted form of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing the Kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain, also called protease nexin II, is internalized and degraded by cells. We show that the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP) is responsible for the endocytosis of secreted APP. APPs770 degradation is inhibited by an LRP antagonist called the receptor-associated protein (RAP) and by LRP antibodies and is greatly diminished in fibroblasts genetically deficient in LRP. APPs695, which lacks the KPI domain, is a poor LRP ligand. Since LRP also binds apolipoprotein E (apoE)-enriched lipoproteins and inheritance of the epsilon 4 allele of the apoE gene is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), these data link in a single metabolic pathway two molecules strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of AD.",1
9285778,Characterization of a new BLM mutation associated with a topoisomerase II alpha defect in a patient with Bloom's syndrome,"Bloom's syndrome (BS), a human recessive disorder associated with an increased risk of malignancy, arises through mutations in both alleles of the BLM gene, which was recently identified as a member of the RecQ helicase family. BS cells are characterized by an increased rate of sister chromatid exchange (SCE). However, a subpopulation of lymphocytes exhibiting a normal level of SCE is observed in some patients. It has been proposed that reversion to a low-SCE phenotype involves an intragenic crossing over between the paternal and maternal BLM alleles, generating a wild-type allele. In this study we characterize a new BLM mutation in a BS patient leading to the replacement, in the C-terminal region of Blm, of a highly conserved cysteine by a phenylalanine in codon 1036. Moreover, our data show that this patient also inherited a BLM allele carrying a mutation affecting its expression and that a somatic intragenic crossing over was involved in reversion to the low-SCE phenotype. Further, we show that both topoisomerase II alpha mRNA and protein levels are decreased in the high-SCE cells derived from this patient, whereas they are normal in the corresponding low-SCE cells. Altogether, our data led us to propose that besides its putative helicase activity, Blm could be involved in transcription regulation.",1

We describe an integral membrane protein that allows trapping of endogenous heme to elucidate trafficking mechanisms. We show that CcsBA, a representative of a superfamily of integral membrane proteins involved in cytochrome c biosynthesis, exports and protects heme from oxidation. CcsBA has 10 transmembrane domains (TMDs) and reconstitutes cytochrome c synthesis in the Escherichia coli periplasm; thus, CcsBA is a cytochrome c synthetase. Purified CcsBA contains heme in an ",0
11351074,An early tobacco mosaic virus-induced oxidative burst in tobacco indicates extracellular perception of the virus coat protein,"Induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed within seconds of the addition of exogenous tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) to the outside of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Samsun NN, EN, or nn) epidermal cells. Cell death was correlated with ROS production. Infectivity of the TMV virus was not a prerequisite for this elicitation and isolated coat protein (CP) subunits could also elicit the fast oxidative burst. The rapid induction of ROS was prevented by both inhibitors of plant signal transduction and inhibitors of NAD(P)H oxidases, suggesting activation of a multi-step signal transduction pathway. Induction of intracellular ROS by TMV was detected in TMV-resistant and -susceptible tobacco cultivars isogenic for the N allele. The burst was also detected with strains of virus that either elicit (ToMV) or fail to elicit (TMV U1) N' gene-mediated responses. Hence, early ROS generation is independent or upstream of known genetic systems in tobacco that can mediate hypersensitive responses. Analysis of other viruses and TMV CP mutants showed marked differences in their ability to induce ROS showing specificity of the response. Thus, initial TMV-plant cell interactions that lead to early ROS induction occur outside the plasma membrane in an event requiring specific CP epitopes.",0
22609319,Improving the prediction of stroke or death after transient ischemic attack (TIA) by adding diffusion-weighted imaging lesions and TIA etiology to the ABCD2 score,"The present study investigated the addition of transient ischemic attack (TIA) etiology and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to the ABCD2 score, creating the ABCDE+ score, to improve the predictive ability of stroke risk or death at 6 months after TIA. We performed a cohort study of 150 consecutive patients with TIA. All patients underwent DWI and all had an etiologic workup and were followed up for 6 months. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare the scores' ability to predict the outcome of stroke or death. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between the measured variables and subsequent stroke or death. Thirty patients (20%) experienced future stroke, and 12 patients (8%) died within the 6-month follow-up. A comparison of AUCs demonstrated the superiority of the ABCDE+ score over the ABCD2 score for predicting stroke (0.64 vs 0.60) and for predicting death (0.62 vs 0.56). ABCD2 score >4, ABCDE+ score >6, large-artery disease, and lesions detected on DWI were found to be independent predictors of future stroke, and ABCDE+ score >6, age, and heart disease were independent predictors of death. We conclude that incorporating DWI positivity and etiology of TIA into the ABCD2 score can improve the ability to predict stroke and death within 6 months after TIA. ",0
9506519,Intestinal tumorigenesis in compound mutant mice of both Dpc4 (Smad4) and Apc genes,"The DPC4 (SMAD4) gene plays a key role in the TGFbeta signaling pathway. We inactivated its mouse homolog Dpc4 (Smad4). The homozygous mutants were embryonic lethal, whereas the heterozygotes showed no abnormality. We then introduced the Dpc4 mutation into the Apc(delta716) knockout mice, a model for human familial adenomatous polyposis. Because both Apc and Dpc4 are located on chromosome 18, we constructed compound heterozygotes carrying both mutations on the same chromosome by meiotic recombination. In such mice, intestinal polyps developed into more malignant tumors than those in the simple Apc(delta716) heterozygotes, showing an extensive stromal cell proliferation, submucosal invasion, cell type heterogeneity, and in vivo transplantability. These results indicate that mutations in DPC4 (SMAD4) play a significant role in the malignant progression of colorectal tumors.",1

Treatment groups were fed one of three doses of GGS in their diet (0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0%, w/w), and the IBD vaccine was administered at 1 and 3 weeks of age. At Weeks 8, 12 and 16, changes in serum IBD antibody titers were measured via the micro-method and T cell proliferation. In gene expression experiments, GGS-treated peripheral T lymphocytes were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA) for 24 h. The mRNA expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) was determined using a semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay. The results showed that a low dose of GGS could significantly raise the antibody titers. Medium and high doses of GGS enhanced IL-2 and IFN-gamma production. GGS altered the expression of IL-4 and IL-12 in T lymphocytes. CD4(+) T lymphocyte development was also skewed towards the Th1 phenotype. GGS enhanced cell-mediated immunity and augmented the effects of IBD vaccination in strengthening subsequent anti-viral responses.",0
2581245,Nucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding human alpha 2-macroglobulin and assignment of the chromosomal locus,"Six alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) cDNA clones were isolated from a human liver cDNA library by using synthetic oligonucleotides as hybridization probes. One of these, p alpha 2M1, carries a 4.6 kilobase-pair insert, which was sequenced. The insert contains the coding sequences for the mature alpha 2M polypeptide (1451 amino acids) and for a 23-amino acid signal peptide at the NH2 terminus of the precursor pro-alpha 2M. At the 3' end of the insert a poly(A) addition signal A-A-T-A-A-A and part of the poly(A) tail of the messenger RNA were found. The protein sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence agrees with the published alpha 2M amino acid sequence for all except three residues. The alpha 2M locus was assigned to human chromosome 12 by Southern blot analysis with DNA from a panel of mouse/human somatic cell hybrids, using alpha 2M cDNA as a hybridization probe.",1

Currently, Pygicera is composed of one species and two subspecies: Pygicera scripta scripta Laporte Gory, 1837 and the Valdivian rainforest subspecies Pygicera scripta krahmeri Moore 1981 (Figs 2-6). The first subspecies is distributed from Limari in the Coquimbo Region to Curico in the Maule Region, both in the coast as well as Andean foothills. This is considered the common subspecies (Moore, 1981; Moore Vidal, 2015). The southern subspecies is distributed from Victoria in the Araucania Region to La Union in Los Rios Region (Moore, 1981; Moore Vidal, 2015) and is the rarest and less abundant subspecies.

3144273,"Identification of the full-length coding sequence for human galactosyltransferase (beta-N-acetylglucosaminide: beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase)","A lambda gt11 human placenta cDNA library was screened using a cDNA probe encoding the COOH-terminal region of human beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase and with a synthetic oligonucleotide having a sequence corresponding to that of the 5' end of the cDNA probe. The newly isolated cDNA was found to code for the NH2-terminal and the 5'-untranslated region, primed at an (A)8 region in the coding sequence. A complete amino acid sequence has been deduced which shows only one membrane anchoring domain near the NH2-terminus. Comparison of the sequence to the soluble enzyme suggests proteolytic cleavage at Arg 77. Presently obtained information of human beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase makes it possible to study DNA mutations responsible for genetic defects such as the altered expression of galactosyltransferase found in a variant of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (HEMPAS).",1
8350835,Tumor localization using fundus view photography for episcleral plaque therapy,"The accurate localization of ophthalmic tumors on the scleral surface is important when calculating radiation dose to the tumor and adjacent structures from episcleral I-125 plaques. This is particularly true for tumors close to the fovea or optic nerve. A fundus view diagram of the eye is often used by ophthalmologists to describe the size and shape of the tumor perimeter as well as its geographical location on the retinal surface. There is, however, an inherent inaccuracy associated with the use of a hand drawn diagram to obtain physical measurements. A computer planning program has been developed which uses CT and a digitized photographic montage of the posterior hemisphere to estimate the size and location of posteriorly located tumors. A simple phantom was constructed to test the software and a direct comparison made between planned versus measured tumor size and location in an excised eye.",0

In parasitology, the most important discovery was lung fluke, followed by research achievement in clinical and basic sciences. In Taiwan, studies on poisonous snake were proceeded rather early. The special medical system in this period included the Gynecological Hospital and medical insurance system. In the medical staff, not a few Japanese were included.

11018263,"Characterisation of the human plunc gene, a gene product with an upper airways and nasopharyngeal restricted expression pattern","Here we report the cloning and characterization of the human homologue of plunc, a murine gene expressed specifically in the upper airways and nasopharyngeal regions. The human plunc cDNA codes for a leucine-rich protein of 256 amino acids which is 72% identical to the murine protein. RNA blot analysis suggests that expression of plunc is restricted to the trachea, upper airway, nasopharyngeal epithelium and salivary gland. The human plunc gene contains nine exons and is localised to chromosome 20q11.2. The unique expression pattern of the human plunc suggest that it may prove a useful model gene with which to study the regulatory mechanisms which direct expression of genes specifically to the upper airways.",1
8797160,Intrinsic versus extrinsic factors in determining the regeneration of the central processes of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons: the influence of a peripheral nerve graft,"The relative contribution of intrinsic growth capacity versus extrinsic growth-promoting factors in determining the capacity of transected dorsal root axons to regenerate long distances was studied. L4 dorsal root axons regenerating into 4-cm peripheral nerve grafts on transected dorsal roots were counted. Few dorsal root myelinated axons regenerated to the distal end of the grafts by 10 weeks unless the sciatic nerve was also crushed. Regeneration of unmyelinated axons was also increased by peripheral lesions. Crush or transection of the dorsal roots without grafting did not alter GAP-43 mRNA expression in L4 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells. Grafting a peripheral nerve onto the cut end of an L4 dorsal root doubled the number of DRG cells expressing high levels of GAP-43 mRNA after a delay of several weeks. Peripheral nerve crush at the time of nerve grafting resulted in a very rapid rise in GAP-43 mRNA expression, which then declined to a steady level, twice that of controls, by 7 weeks. Thus, the rapid increase in the number of DRG neurons expressing high levels of GAP-43 mRNA after peripheral but not central axotomy correlates with the regeneration of central axons through nerve grafts. Because GAP-43 mRNA is slowly upregulated in a subpopulation of sensory neurons in response to exposure of their central axons to a peripheral nerve environment, environments favourable for axonal growth may act by increasing the intrinsic growth response of neurons. Lack of intrinsic growth capacity may contribute to the failure of dorsal root axons to regenerate into the spinal cord.",0
28009069,Test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of in vivo myelin content indices: Myelin water fraction and calibrated T1 w/T2 w image ratio,"In an age-heterogeneous sample of healthy adults, we examined test-retest reliability (with and without participant repositioning) of two popular MRI methods of estimating myelin content: modeling the short spin-spin (T2 ) relaxation component of multi-echo imaging data and computing the ratio of T1 -weighted and T2 -weighted images (T1 w/T2 w). Taking the myelin water fraction (MWF) index of myelin content derived from the multi-component T2 relaxation data as a standard, we evaluate the concurrent and differential validity of T1 w/T2 w ratio images. The results revealed high reliability of MWF and T1 w/T2 w ratio. However, we found significant correlations of low to moderate magnitude between MWF and the T1 w/T2 w ratio in only two of six examined regions of the cerebral white matter. Notably, significant correlations of the same or greater magnitude were observed for T1 w/T2 w ratio and the intermediate T2 relaxation time constant, which is believed to reflect differences in the mobility of water between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. We conclude that although both methods are highly reliable and thus well-suited for longitudinal studies, T1 w/T2 w ratio has low criterion validity and may be not an optimal index of subcortical myelin content.

14685937,Variation in a repeat sequence determines whether a common variant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene is pathogenic or benign,"An abbreviated tract of five thymidines (5T) in intron 8 of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene is found in approximately 10% of individuals in the general population. When found in trans with a severe CFTR mutation, 5T can result in male infertility, nonclassic cystic fibrosis, or a normal phenotype. To test whether the number of TG repeats adjacent to 5T influences disease penetrance, we determined TG repeat number in 98 patients with male infertility due to congenital absence of the vas deferens, 9 patients with nonclassic CF, and 27 unaffected individuals (fertile men). Each of the individuals in this study had a severe CFTR mutation on one CFTR gene and 5T on the other. Of the unaffected individuals, 78% (21 of 27) had 5T adjacent to 11 TG repeats, compared with 9% (10 of 107) of affected individuals. Conversely, 91% (97 of 107) of affected individuals had 12 or 13 TG repeats, versus only 22% (6 of 27) of unaffected individuals (P<.00001). Those individuals with 5T adjacent to either 12 or 13 TG repeats were substantially more likely to exhibit an abnormal phenotype than those with 5T adjacent to 11 TG repeats (odds ratio 34.0, 95% CI 11.1-103.7, P<.00001). Thus, determination of TG repeat number will allow for more accurate prediction of benign versus pathogenic 5T alleles.",1
21710558,Maximum likelihood estimation in generalized linear models with multiple covariates subject to detection limits,"The analysis of data subject to detection limits is becoming increasingly necessary in many environmental and laboratory studies. Covariates subject to detection limits are often left censored because of a measurement device having a minimal lower limit of detection. In this paper, we propose a Monte Carlo version of the expectation-maximization algorithm to handle large number of covariates subject to detection limits in generalized linear models. We model the covariate distribution via a sequence of one-dimensional conditional distributions, and sample the covariate values using an adaptive rejection metropolis algorithm. Parameter estimation is obtained by maximization via the Monte Carlo M-step. This procedure is applied to a real dataset from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in which values of urinary heavy metals are subject to a limit of detection. Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed approach can lead to a significant reduction in variance for parameter estimates in these models, improving the power of such studies.",0

15616186,The forkhead-associated domain protein Cep170 interacts with Polo-like kinase 1 and serves as a marker for mature centrioles,"We report the characterization of Cep170, a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain protein of previously unknown function. Cep170 was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for interactors of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1). In human cells, Cep170 is constantly expressed throughout the cell cycle but phosphorylated during mitosis. It interacts with Plk1 in vivo and can be phosphorylated by Plk1 in vitro, suggesting that it is a physiological substrate of this kinase. Both overexpression and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion studies suggest a role for Cep170 in microtuble organization and cell morphology. Cep170 associates with centrosomes during interphase and with spindle microtubules during mitosis. As shown by immunoelectron microscopy, Cep170 associates with subdistal appendages, typical of the mature mother centriole. Thus, anti-Cep170 antibodies stain only one centriole during G1, S, and early G2, but two centrioles during late G2 phase of the cell cycle. We show that Cep170 labeling can be used to discriminate bona fide centriole overduplication from centriole amplification that results from aborted cell division.",1

2357969,Hepatocyte dedifferentiation and extinction is accompanied by a block in the synthesis of mRNA coding for the transcription factor HNF1/LFB1,"The promoter proximal sequences of a group of liver-specific genes including that of albumin interact with the same hepato-specific factor named HNF1, LFB1, APF or HP1, a distant member of the homeoprotein family. A distinct protein, termed variant HNF1 (vHNF1), of lower mol. wt but displaying identical sequence specificity is found both in dedifferentiated variants and in an extinguished somatic hybrid that fail to express most or all of the tissue-specific traits, including albumin. We show here that HNF1 transcripts are present only in differentiated hepatoma cells. No transcripts are detected in dedifferentiated variants or in the extinguished cell hybrid, strongly suggesting that the vHNF1 protein is encoded by a distinct gene. Finally, HNF1 transcripts reappear in revertants to the hepatic phenotype. Run-on transcription analysis in isolated nuclei demonstrates that the expression of HNF1 in these cell lines is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. Contrary to HNF1, the mRNAs coding for two other nuclear factors involved in albumin transcription, C/EBP and NF1, do not follow the distribution of albumin transcripts in these cell lines. These results indicate that extinction in somatic hybrids or loss of expression upon dedifferentiation of liver-specific genes possessing an HNF1 recognition site is caused, at least in part, by a block in HNF1 gene expression.",0

Studies published from 1996 to 2017 in English were considered.Study selectionTwo independent reviewers screened the literature. Randomised clinical trials, non-randomised clinical trials with parallel groups or single group, retrospective studies) evaluating different posterior restorations (class I, class II restorations and crowns) with different materials (amalgam, compomer, composite, glass ionomer cement, stainless steel crown) placed in primary teeth by reporting different outcomes measures (survival rate, success rate, annual failure rate).Data extraction and synthesisTwo independent reviewers extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A qualitative analysis was conducted.ResultsThirty-one studies were included. Seven different materials were used for restorations: amalgam (six studies), compomer (nine studies), composite (six studies), conventional glass ionomer cement (five studies), metal-reinforced glass ionomer cement (MRGIC) (four studies), resin-modified glass ionomer cement (ten studies), and stainless steel crown (SSC) (three studies). When considering the annual failure rate (AFR), composite showed the lowest (1.7-12.9%) and MRGIC showed the highest (10.0-29.9%). For the success rate, SSC presented the highest (96.1%) and MRGIC presented the lowest (57.4%). Class I restorations and restorations placed under the use of rubber dam revealed better results in both AFR and success rate. The main reason for failure was secondary caries.ConclusionsThere is a large variation in longevity of posterior restorations in primary teeth. Secondary caries is the main reason causing failure.",0
18663352,Genome-wide analysis of genetic alterations in Barrett's adenocarcinoma using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays,"We performed genome-wide analysis of copy-number changes and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to identify associated genomic alterations. DNA from 27 esophageal adenocarcinomas and 14 matching normal tissues was subjected to SNP microarrays. The data were analyzed using dChipSNP software. Copy-number changes occurring in at least 25% of the cases and LOH occurring in at least 19% were regarded as relevant changes. As a validation, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of 8q24.21 (CMYC) and 8p23.1 (SOX7) was performed. Previously described genomic alterations in esophageal adenocarcinomas could be confirmed by SNP microarrays, such as amplification on 8q (CMYC, confirmed by FISH) and 20q13 or deletion/LOH on 3p (FHIT) and 9p (CDKN2A). Moreover, frequent gains were detected on 2p23.3, 7q11.22, 13q31.1, 14q32.31, 17q23.2 and 20q13.2 harboring several novel candidate genes. The highest copy numbers were seen on 8p23.1, the location of SOX7, which could be demonstrated to be involved in amplification by FISH. A nuclear overexpression of the transcription factor SOX7 could be detected by immunohistochemistry in two amplified tumors. Copy-number losses were seen on 18q21.32 and 20p11.21, harboring interesting candidate genes, such as CDH20 and CST4. Finally, a novel LOH region could be identified on 6p in at least 19% of the cases. In conclusion, SNP microarrays are a valuable tool to detect DNA copy-number changes and LOH at a high resolution. Using this technique, we identified several novel genes and DNA regions associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma.",0
16871021,Primary structure of mature SAG1 gene of an Indonesian Toxoplasma gondii and comparison with other strains,"Toxoplasma gondii is a persistent protozoan parasite capable of infecting almost any warm-blooded vertebrates. SAG1 (p30) is the prototypic member of a superfamily of surface antigens called SRS (SAG1-related sequence). It constitutes the most abundant and predominant antigen. In this paper the primary structure of mature SAG1 gene of an Indonesian T. gondii isolate is described and sequence comparison is made with published sequence data of 7 other strains or isolates. Sequence comparison indicated that SAG1 is highly conserved through evolution and despite parasite spreading world-wide. Sequences may be divided into two major families, independent of the strain/isolate geographic origin. Variations were mainly localized at the C-terminal half or domain 2 and some clustered in restricted areas. Sequence comparison allowed us to define the Indonesian isolate as genuine virulent RH strain. A phylogenetic tree of Toxoplasma strains/isolates was constructed based on SAG1.",0
12099691,Alu DNA polymorphism in ACE gene is protective for age-related macular degeneration,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. We report an association between an Alu polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene with the dry/atrophic form of AMD. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on genomic DNA isolated from patients with AMD (n=173), and an age-matched control population (n=189), we amplified a region polymorphic for an Alu element insertion in the ACE gene. The Alu(+/+) genotype occurred 4.5 times more frequently in the control population than the dry/atrophic AMD patient population, (p=0.004). The predominance of the Alu(+/+) genotype within the unaffected control group represents a protective insertion with respect to the human ocular disease, dry/atrophic AMD. This is the first demonstration of an Alu element insertion exerting protective effects against a known human disease.",1

Critical pathways are one means of supporting systematic use of evidence-based recommendations. METHODS: Patients admitted for HF in one hospital in 2009 and included in a critical pathway were compared with a control group of patients admitted in 2007. The primary endpoint was the risk of death or readmission within 90 days after discharge. The hazard ratio of death or readmission was evaluated in a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model adjusting for age, sex, co-morbidities, and length of stay. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-three patients were evaluated (151 in the critical pathway and 212 in the control group). Adjusted hazard ratio for death or readmission at 90 days was 0.72 (95 CI 0.51-1.00, p=0.049). Adhesion to guidelines was significantly better for patients included in the critical pathway (p=0.004), with more frequent prescription of beta-blockers (70.9% (95% CI 62.9-78.0) vs. 56.6% (95% CI 49.6-63.4), p=0.006), and evaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, 73.5% (95% CI 65.7-80.3) vs. 57.5% (95% CI 50.6-64.3), p=0.002). Patients with reduced LVEF seem to have benefited the most from the inclusion in the critical pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a critical pathway for patients hospitalized for HF was associated with a 28% reduction of the relative risk of death or readmission and improved adhesion to guidelines.",0
11298701,The effects of variable pulse width of Er:YAG laser on facial skin,"BACKGROUND: The use of CO2 and Er:YAG lasers for resurfacing has increased significantly in the past few years. Er:YAG laser causes pinpoint bleeding during and after treatment with a typical pulse width of 250 microsec. A longer pulse of Er:YAG laser can potentially coagulate dermal blood vessels and increase the residual thermal damage (RTD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of various pulse durations of Er:YAG laser on the depth of RTD and bleeding. METHODS: The preauricular skin of a volunteer was exposed to Er:YAG laser at 250-, 350-, and 700-microsec pulse durations, with a fluence of 5 J/cm2. The number of passes varied between 6 and 16. The treated skin was excised and a histologic evaluation was done. RESULTS: The maximum depth of RTD was 50 microm and there was decreased bleeding with a 700-microsec pulse duration. CONCLUSION: The increased pulse duration of Er:YAG laser of 700 micros does not increase the maximum reported RTD and therefore would not change the recovery time and may have a beneficial effect on hemostasis.",0
3855405,Linkage relationships of the gene for apolipoprotein CII with loci on chromosome 19,"Two common restriction fragment length polymorphisms detected with cloned gene probes for apolipoprotein CII (apo CII) have been used to study the inheritance of the gene in families segregating for loci on chromosome 19. Lod scores for APOC2 with the gene for complement component 3 (C3) exclude close linkage and give a maximum at a male recombination fraction of 0.25-0.30. Lod scores for APOC2 and FHC, the gene causing familial hypercholesterolaemia, are negative in males and suggest the genes may not be linked. However, it appears that APOC2 may be closely linked to the blood group loci Lutheran (Lu) and Secretor (Se), and probably less closely linked to Lewis (Le). These data are consistent with the gene order: FHC-----C3-----(Lu, Se, APOC2)",1

21107324,Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F,"In all animal cells, phospholipids are asymmetrically distributed between the outer and inner leaflets of the plasma membrane. This asymmetrical phospholipid distribution is disrupted in various biological systems. For example, when blood platelets are activated, they expose phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) to trigger the clotting system. The PtdSer exposure is believed to be mediated by Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid scramblases that transport phospholipids bidirectionally, but its molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here we show that TMEM16F (transmembrane protein 16F) is an essential component for the Ca(2+)-dependent exposure of PtdSer on the cell surface. When a mouse B-cell line, Ba/F3, was treated with a Ca(2+) ionophore under low-Ca(2+) conditions, it reversibly exposed PtdSer. Using this property, we established a Ba/F3 subline that strongly exposed PtdSer by repetitive fluorescence-activated cell sorting. A complementary DNA library was constructed from the subline, and a cDNA that caused Ba/F3 to expose PtdSer spontaneously was identified by expression cloning. The cDNA encoded a constitutively active mutant of TMEM16F, a protein with eight transmembrane segments. Wild-type TMEM16F was localized on the plasma membrane and conferred Ca(2+)-dependent scrambling of phospholipids. A patient with Scott syndrome, which results from a defect in phospholipid scrambling activity, was found to carry a mutation at a splice-acceptor site of the gene encoding TMEM16F, causing the premature termination of the protein.",1
19896973,The role of antihistaminic effects in the misuse of quetiapine: a case report and review of the literature,"Recent case reports and case series suggest that the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine has the potential for misuse. This includes drug-seeking behaviors motivated by quetiapine as well as inappropriate (intranasal or intravenous) administration. We present an additional case of quetiapine misuse and review other published cases. In general, quetiapine misuse is associated with prior CNS depressant use and is more common in forensic settings. The mechanism of reinforcement for this misuse is unknown, but we hypothesize that it is related to quetiapine's pharmacological profile as an antihistamine with a relative low affinity for dopamine receptors. The risks to individuals and society of exaggerating/simulating symptoms to obtain high-dose quetiapine in the absence of a clinical indication are discussed. This includes the unwelcome possibility of restricting access to this effective medication.",0
15110771,A genetic variant of ACE increases cell survival: a new paradigm for biology and disease,"The human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphism is caused by an Alu element insertion resulting in three genotypes (Alu+/+, Alu+/-, Alu-/-, or ACE-II, ACE-ID, and ACE-DD, respectively), with ACE-II displaying lower ACE activity. The polymorphism is associated with athletic performance, aging, and disease. Population studies, however, were confounding because variants of the polymorphism appeared to fortuitously correlate with health and various pathological states. To clarify the functional role of the polymorphism, we studied its direct effect on cell survival. ACE-II (Alu+/+) human endothelial cells (EC) had lower angiotensin-II levels and 20-fold increased viability after slow starvation as compared to ACE-DD cells (Alu-/-). By RT-PCR, only ACE-II cells expressed the pluripotent/stem cell-maintenance factors nanog, numb, and klotho. ACE inhibition by captopril in ACE-DD cells mimicked the ACE-II genotype. These results provide the first evidence of a functional role for a naturally occurring polymorphism, having broad implications for human biology, longevity, and disease.",1

29861820,TOWARD BAYESIAN INFERENCE OF THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF PROTEINS FROM THREE-CUBE FORSTER RESONANCE ENERGY TRANSFER DATA,"Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a quantum-physical phenomenon where energy may be transferred from one molecule to a neighbor molecule if the molecules are close enough. Using fluorophore molecule marking of proteins in a cell, it is possible to measure in microscopic images to what extent FRET takes place between the fluorophores. This provides indirect information of the spatial distribution of the proteins. Questions of particular interest are whether (and if so to which extent) proteins of possibly different types interact or whether they appear independently of each other. In this paper we propose a new likelihood-based approach to statistical inference for FRET microscopic data. The likelihood function is obtained from a detailed modeling of the FRET data-generating mechanism conditional on a protein configuration. We next follow a Bayesian approach and introduce a spatial point process prior model for the protein configurations depending on hyperparameters quantifying the intensity of the point process. Posterior distributions are evaluated using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We propose to infer microscope-related parameters in an initial step from reference data without interaction between the proteins. The new methodology is applied to simulated and real datasets.",0
3879968,Genetic polymorphism of complement component C8,"Extensive genetic polymorphism of complement component C8 was demonstrated by isoelectric focusing of serum or plasma samples followed by immunoblotting procedures. Using these methods, we could detect both alpha-gamma (C81) and beta (C82) chain polymorphisms in the same gel. Two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis of C8 immunoprecipitates was used to obtain further information of the C8 patterns. Evidence was obtained that the C81 polymorphism resides in the structural gene of the C8 alpha chain. Both C8 systems show autosomal, chiefly codominant inheritance, and the distribution of phenotypes agrees with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Our findings suggest at least five different alleles in the C81 system; the gene frequencies of the two most common ones, C81*A and C81*B being 0.59 and 0.39, respectively. In C82 we found evidence for at least three codominant alleles, the gene frequencies for the two most common ones, C82*B and C82*A being 0.94 and 0.05, respectively. In addition, family studies disclosed the existence of a null allele, C82*Q0.",1
29170278,A mitosis-specific and R loop-driven ATR pathway promotes faithful chromosome segregation,"The ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase is crucial for DNA damage and replication stress responses. Here, we describe an unexpected role of ATR in mitosis. Acute inhibition or degradation of ATR in mitosis induces whole-chromosome missegregation. The effect of ATR ablation is not due to altered cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity, DNA damage responses, or unscheduled DNA synthesis but to loss of an ATR function at centromeres. In mitosis, ATR localizes to centromeres through Aurora A-regulated association with centromere protein F (CENP-F), allowing ATR to engage replication protein A (RPA)-coated centromeric R loops. As ATR is activated at centromeres, it stimulates Aurora B through Chk1, preventing formation of lagging chromosomes. Thus, a mitosis-specific and R loop-driven ATR pathway acts at centromeres to promote faithful chromosome segregation, revealing functions of R loops and ATR in suppressing chromosome instability.",1
31689079,Aluminum Metasurface with Hybrid Multipolar Plasmons for 1000-Fold Broadband Visible Fluorescence Enhancement and Multiplexed Biosensing,"Aluminum (Al)-based nanoantennae traditionally suffer from weak plasmonic performance in the visible range, necessitating the application of more expensive noble metal substrates for rapidly expanding biosensing opportunities. We introduce a metasurface comprising Al nanoantennae of nanodisks-in-cavities that generate hybrid multipolar lossless plasmonic modes to strongly enhance local electromagnetic fields and increase the coupled emitter's local density of states throughout the visible regime. This results in highly efficient electromagnetic field confinement in visible wavelengths by these nanoantennae, favoring real-world plasmonic applications of Al over other noble metals. Additionally, we demonstrate spontaneous localization and concentration of target molecules at metasurface hotspots, leading to further improved on-chip detection sensitivity and a broadband fluorescence-enhancement factor above 1000 for visible wavelengths with respect to glass chips commonly used in bioassays. Using the metasurface and a multiplexing technique involving three visible wavelengths, we successfully detected three biomarkers, insulin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and thrombin relevant to diabetes, ocular and cardiovascular diseases, respectively, in a single 10 muL droplet containing only 1 fmol of each biomarker.",0
12192049,"A Mammalian bromodomain protein, brd4, interacts with replication factor C and inhibits progression to S phase","Brd4 belongs to the BET family of nuclear proteins that carry two bromodomains implicated in the interaction with chromatin. Expression of Brd4 correlates with cell growth and is induced during early G(1) upon mitogenic stimuli. In the present study, we investigated the role of Brd4 in cell growth regulation. We found that ectopic expression of Brd4 in NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells inhibits cell cycle progression from G(1) to S. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that endogenous and transfected Brd4 interacts with replication factor C (RFC), the conserved five-subunit complex essential for DNA replication. In vitro analysis showed that Brd4 binds directly to the largest subunit, RFC-140, thereby interacting with the entire RFC. In line with the inhibitory activity seen in vivo, recombinant Brd4 inhibited RFC-dependent DNA elongation reactions in vitro. Analysis of Brd4 deletion mutants indicated that both the interaction with RFC-140 and the inhibition of entry into S phase are dependent on the second bromodomain of Brd4. Lastly, supporting the functional importance of this interaction, it was found that cotransfection with RFC-140 reduced the growth-inhibitory effect of Brd4. Taken as a whole, the present study suggests that Brd4 regulates cell cycle progression in part by interacting with RFC.",1
27632686,Loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked biglycan gene cause a severe syndromic form of thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections,"PURPOSE: Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but rare X-linked families have been described. So far, the only known X-linked gene is FLNA, which is associated with the periventricular nodular heterotopia type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. However, mutations in this gene explain only a small number of X-linked TAAD families. METHODS: We performed targeted resequencing of 368 candidate genes in a cohort of 11 molecularly unexplained Marfan probands. Subsequently, Sanger sequencing of BGN in 360 male and 155 female molecularly unexplained TAAD probands was performed. RESULTS: We found five individuals with loss-of-function mutations in BGN encoding the small leucine-rich proteoglycan biglycan. The clinical phenotype is characterized by early-onset aortic aneurysm and dissection. Other recurrent findings include hypertelorism, pectus deformity, joint hypermobility, contractures, and mild skeletal dysplasia. Fluorescent staining revealed an increase in TGF-beta signaling, evidenced by an increase in nuclear pSMAD2 in the aortic wall. Our results are in line with those of prior reports demonstrating that Bgn-deficient male BALB/cA mice die from aortic rupture. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, BGN gene defects in humans cause an X-linked syndromic form of severe TAAD that is associated with preservation of elastic fibers and increased TGF-beta signaling.Genet Med 19 4, 386-395.",1
25697777,Structures and functions of protein disulfide isomerase family members involved in proteostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential cellular compartment in which an enormous number of secretory and cell surface membrane proteins are synthesized and subjected to cotranslational or posttranslational modifications, such as glycosylation and disulfide bond formation. Proper maintenance of ER protein homeostasis (sometimes termed proteostasis) is essential to avoid cellular stresses and diseases caused by abnormal proteins. Accumulating knowledge of cysteine-based redox reactions catalyzed by members of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family has revealed that these enzymes play pivotal roles in productive protein folding accompanied by disulfide formation, as well as efficient ER-associated degradation accompanied by disulfide reduction. Each of PDI family members forms a protein-protein interaction with a preferential partner to fulfill a distinct function. Multiple redox pathways that utilize PDIs appear to function synergistically to attain the highest quality and productivity of the ER, even under various stress conditions. This review describes the structures, physiological functions, and cooperative actions of several essential PDIs, and provides important insights into the elaborate proteostatic mechanisms that have evolved in the extremely active and stress-sensitive ER.

24497763,The management of incidental findings of reduction mammoplasty specimens,"Reduction mammoplasty is one of the most commonly performed procedures in plastic surgery. Occasionally, there are findings reported by pathologists that are unfamiliar to the treating surgeon. The aim of the present study was to determine the types of pathologies encountered in reduction mammoplasty specimens. From this list of diagnoses, a best practice guideline for management will be organized to better assist plastic surgeons in the management of patients with incidental findings on pathology reports. A total of 441 pathology reports from patients who underwent bilateral or unilateral reduction mammoplasty in the past three years were identified. A list of 21 different pathologies was generated from the pathology reports, along with supplemental data from recent texts and articles. Occult carcinomas were encountered in two cases (0.45%) and high-risk lesions were found in three cases (0.68%) at the authors' institution. An algorithm was then constructed to organize the pathologies according to risk of malignancy and assign them to a management guideline. There are many different lesions encountered incidentally in reduction mammoplasty specimens that may or may not confer some cancer risk. It is important for plastic surgeons to know which lesions need closer follow-up to provide the best care for their patients. ",0
27392039,Neuroprotective Properties of a Macrolide Antibiotic in a Mouse Model of Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion: Characterization of the Immunomodulatory Effects and Validation of the Efficacy of Intravenous Administration,"Repurposing the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin has recently been suggested as a promising neuroprotective strategy for the acute treatment of ischemic stroke. Here, we aim at further characterizing the immunomodulatory properties of intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of this drug and, more importantly, at assessing whether neuroprotection can also be achieved by the more clinically relevant intravenous (i.v.) route of administration in a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia induced by transient (30-min) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). A single i.p. injection of azithromycin (150 mg/kg) upon reperfusion prevented ischemia-induced spleen contraction and increased the number of MAC-1-immunopositive microglia/macrophages in the ischemic hemisphere 48 h after the insult. This was paralleled by an elevation of alternatively activated phenotypes (i.e., Ym1-immunopositive M2-polarized cells) and by a reduced expression of the pro-inflammatory marker myeloperoxidase. More importantly, i.v. administration of azithromycin upon reperfusion reduced MCAo-induced infarct volume and cerebral edema to an extent comparable to that obtained via the i.p. route. Although the i.p. route is often used for research purposes, it is impractical in the clinical setting; however, i.v. administration can easily be used in ischemic stroke patients who usually have i.v. access already established on hospital admission. The neuroprotective efficacy of the clinically relevant i.v. administration of azithromycin, together with its beneficial immunomodulatory properties reported in mice subjected to transient MCAo, suggests that this macrolide antibiotic can be effectively repurposed for the acute treatment of ischemic stroke. To this end, further work is needed to validate the efficacy of azithromycin in the clinical setting.",0
14985318,Caspase-3 in postnatal retinal development and degeneration,"PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of caspase-3 ablation on photoreceptor degeneration in the rd-1 mouse. Concurrently, the role of caspase-3 in postnatal retinal development was evaluated. Caspase-3 is an important effector caspase that mediates many of the terminal proteolytic events of apoptosis. Its activation has been demonstrated in rodent models of photoreceptor degeneration and its ablation results in exencephaly and neonatal death. METHODS: Retinal morphometry was performed at the light microscopic level in caspase-3 mutant mice from PN0 through PN23, and in rd-1/caspase-3 double mutant mice at PN14, -16, and -18. This was supplemented by terminal dUTP transferase nick end labeling (TUNEL) and immunohistochemical staining for activated caspase-3, rhodopsin, factor VII-related antigen and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). RESULTS: Caspase-3-deficient animals display marginal microphthalmia, peripapillary retinal dysplasia, delayed regression of vitreal vasculature, and retarded apoptotic kinetics of the inner nuclear layer. Ablation of caspase-3 provided transient photoreceptor protection in rd-1, but TUNEL-positive rod death proceeded, despite the absence of caspase-3 activation. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo, caspase-3 is not critical for rod photoreceptor development, nor does it play a significant role in mediating pathologic rod death. Peripapillary dysplastic lesions suggest that there is delayed fusion of the optic fissure, and inner nuclear layer abnormalities indicate a cell-specific dependency on the mitochondria-caspase axis during development. The temporal nature of apoptotic retardation in the absence of caspase-3 implies the presence of caspase-independent mechanisms of developmental and pathologic cell death.",1

16984283,Role of non-HLA genetic polymorphisms in graft-versus-host disease after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation,"Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is the main complication after haematopoietic stem cells transplantation (HSCT) and acute forms (aGvHD) occur in 20-40% of cases even after donor (D) and recipient (R) HLA matching, apparently because of D/R minor histocompatibility antigen (mHA) mismatches and cytokine polymorphisms. The genotype of cytokines and mHA of 77 haematological R following HSCT from HLA identical siblings were determined to detect genetic polymorphisms correlated with GvHD. We analysed TNFA (-863 C/A, -857 C/T and G/A at positions -574, -376, -308, -244, -238), IL-10 (-1082 G/A, -819 C/A, -592 C/T), IL-1B (T/C +3953), IL-1RA (VNTR), HA-1 (H/R allele) and CD-31 (C/G at codon 125, A/G at codon 563). Allele frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and similar to those of 77 healthy controls. We observed positive correlations between a lower risk of clinically significant aGvHD and both the presence of -1082G -819C -592C IL-10 haplotype when both R and D are considered together and the absence of R IL-1RA allele 2. Furthermore, we observed an association between the absence of TNF-A -238 A allele and the risk of extensive chronic GvHD. mHA and cytokines genotyping would thus seem a valid source of information for the prior identification of recipients with a higher risk of aGvHD.",0
14986940,A synthetic antibacterial peptide from Mytilus galloprovincialis reduces mortality due to white spot syndrome virus in palaemonid shrimp,"White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) isolated from Penaeus monodon was found to be highly infective for the western Mediterranean shrimp, Palaemon sp. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), it was demonstrated that such shrimp are not naturally carriers of WSSV. Following challenge with virus, mortality reached 100% 3.5-4 days after injection at 22 degrees C. Incubation of infected shrimp at 10 degrees C totally suppressed the mortality which rapidly developed when shrimp were returned to 18 or 22 degrees C. Preincubation of WSSV with mature synthetic mytilin significantly reduced shrimp mortality with a 50% efficient dose of about 5 microM. Survival of shrimp was not due to the development of an active mechanism of defence as re-injection of WSSV produced the same mortality pattern. Mortality was probably due to WSSV replication as dot blot failed to detect viral DNA in the injection sample but was positive 1 day post-injection. Protection by mytilin was by interaction at the virus level, preventing replication as no WSSV nucleic acid was detected by PCR even after 7 days in shrimp injected with WSSV preincubated with 10 or 50 microM mytilin.",0
21820953,A comparative study on the ionic liquid [bmim][BF4] and its solution with transient absorption spectroscopy,"A detailed study was explored to compare the transient absorption spectra of the neat 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim][BF(4)]) with its solution in water or acetonitrile. It was concluded that the excited triplet state (3)[bmim](+*) was produced after 266 nm laser irradiation, and then the neutral radical [bmim] and the cation radical [bmim] (2+) were formed through two possible paths. The transient absorption spectra of the neat [bmim][BF(4)] and its solution were similar but the reaction kinetics were different due to their different local structures such as dimeric or cluster. The energy transfer between excited [bmim][BF(4)] and beta-carotene further affirmed the existence of (3)[bmim](+*). And the reaction that the hydrated electron captured by [bmim](+) to produce [bmim] in solution was observed.",0
10518500,"A novel WD40 protein, CHE-2, acts cell-autonomously in the formation of C. elegans sensory cilia","To elucidate the mechanism of sensory cilium formation, we analyzed mutants in the Caenorhabditis elegans che-2 gene. These mutants have extremely short cilia with an abnormal posterior projection, and show defects in behaviors that are mediated by ciliated sensory neurons. The che-2 gene encodes a new member of the WD40 protein family, suggesting that it acts in protein-protein interaction. Analysis of mutation sites showed that both the amino-terminal WD40 repeats and the carboxyl-terminal non-WD40 domain are necessary for the CHE-2 function. CHE-2-tagged green fluorescent protein is localized at the cilia of almost all the ciliated sensory neurons. Expression of che-2 in a subset of sensory neurons of a che-2 mutant by using a heterologous promoter resulted in restoration of the functions and cilium morphology of only the che-2-expressing neurons. Thus, che-2 acts cell-autonomously. This technique can be used in the future for determining the function of each type of che-2-expressing sensory neuron. Using green fluorescent protein, we found that the extension of cilia in wild-type animals took place at the late embryonic stage, whereas the cilia of che-2 mutant animals remained always short during development. Hence, the abnormal posterior projection is due to the inability of cilia to extend, rather than degeneration of cilia once correctly formed. Expression of che-2 in a che-2 mutant under a heat shock promoter showed that the extension of cilia, surprisingly, can occur even at the adult stage, and that such cilia can function apparently normally in behavior.",0
15502844,Aggressive amyloidosis in mice expressing human amyloid peptides with the Arctic mutation,"The Arctic mutation within the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide causes Alzheimer disease. In vitro, Arctic-mutant Abeta forms (proto)fibrils more effectively than wild-type Abeta. We generated transgenic mouse lines expressing Arctic-mutant human amyloid precursor proteins (hAPP). Amyloid plaques formed faster and were more extensive in Arctic mice than in hAPP mice expressing wild-type Abeta, even though Arctic mice had lower Abeta(1-42/1-40) ratios. Thus, the Arctic mutation is highly amyloidogenic in vivo.",1
12586813,Barriers to hospice care among older patients dying with lung and colorectal cancer,"PURPOSE: To identify factors associated with hospice enrollment and length of stay in hospice among patients dying with lung or colorectal cancer. METHODS: We used the Linked Medicare-Tumor Registry Database to conduct a retrospective analysis of the last year of life among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with lung or colorectal cancer at age > or = 66 years between January 1, 1973, and December 31, 1996, in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program who died between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1998. Our outcomes of interest were time from cancer diagnosis to hospice enrollment and length of stay in hospice care. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to adjust for demographic and clinical information. RESULTS: We studied elderly patients dying with lung cancer (n = 62,117) or colorectal cancer (n = 57,260). Overall, 27% of patients (n = 16,750) with lung cancer and 20% of patients (n = 11,332) with colorectal cancer received hospice care before death. Median length of stay for hospice patients with lung and colorectal cancer was 25 and 28 days, respectively. Overall, 20% of patients entered hospice within 1 week of death, whereas 6% entered more than 6 months before death. Factors associated with later hospice enrollment include being male; being of nonwhite, nonblack race; having fee-for-service insurance; and residing in a rural community. Many of these factors also were associated with shorter stays in hospice. CONCLUSION: Although use of hospice care has increased dramatically over time, specific patient groups, including men, patients residing in rural communities, and patients with fee-for-service insurance continue to experience delays in hospice enrollment.",0
16804045,"The A645D mutation in the hinge region of the human androgen receptor (AR) gene modulates AR activity, depending on the context of the polymorphic glutamine and glycine repeats","BACKGROUND: Sufficient androgen receptor (AR) activity is crucial for normal male sexual differentiation. Here we report on two unrelated 46, XY patients suffering from undervirilization and genital malformations. Both patients had a short polyglycine (polyG) repeat of 10 residues and a relatively long polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat of 28 and 30 residues within the transactivation domain of the AR. In addition, they also harbor a rare A645D substitution. OBJECTIVE: We made a set of AR expression plasmid constructs with varying polyQ and polyG tract sizes in context with or without the A645D substitution and analyzed their in vitro transactivation capacity in transfected CHO cells. RESULTS: We found that a short polyG repeat downmodulated AR activity to approximately 60-65% of the wild-type receptor. This effect was aggravated by A645D in context of a long polyQ repeat to less than 50% activity. In contrast, in the context of a short polyQ and a short polyG repeat, the A645D mutation rescues AR activity to almost wild-type levels, demonstrating a contradictory effect of this mutation, depending on the size of the polymorphic repeats. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of a short polyG repeat with a long polyQ repeat and an A645D substitution might contribute to the development of virilization disorders and explain the observed phenotypes of our patients as a form of androgen insensitivity. The whole recreation of AR sequence variations including individual polymorphic repeat sizes could unravel possible interference of mutations and variations on AR activity by in vitro transfection.",1
16504017,"Willingness to pay for health care services in common cold, retinal detachment, and myocardiac infarction: an internet survey in Japan","BACKGROUND: The application of Willingness To Pay (WTP) measurement with Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) to medical services is gradually increasing. Knowing what influences WTP is an important matter because validity of CVM in medical services remains controversial. The objective of this survey is to measure WTP for the treatment of typical acute illnesses and to analyze the factors affecting WTP. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted over the Internet, in which 795 men and women between 40 and 59 years old responded to questions about WTP for medical expenses in three hypothetical scenarios: common cold (CC), retinal detachment (RD) and myocardiac infarction (MI). RESULTS: Mean WTP was $29.9 for CC, $2,233 for RD, and $8,976 for MI. WTP for RD and MI was lower in the low-income group. While WTP for CC did not vary with income, WTP was higher in groups whose current subjective fitness levels were low. CONCLUSION: Although WTP measurements are criticized frequently for their validity and reliability, they are still useful for determining the economic value of medical services. Based on the results of this study, it is deemed necessary to enhance safety nets for low-income earners in regards to serious illnesses that incur high medical expenses. Further, it is recommended that the rate of co-payments be set relatively high with respect to mild illnesses for which alternative services are available.",0
23347463,Integrating genetic and imaging investigations into the clinical management of congenital hyperinsulinism,"Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a rare but important cause of hypoglycaemia in infancy. CHI is a heterogeneous disease, but has a strong genetic basis; a number of genetic causes have been identified with CHI in about a third of individuals, chiefly in the genes that code for the ATP sensitive K(+) channels (KATP ) in the pancreatic beta-cells. Rapid KATP channel gene testing is a critical early step in the diagnostic algorithm of CHI, with paternal heterozygosity correlating with the occurrence of focal lesions. Imaging investigations to diagnose and localize solitary pancreatic foci have evolved over the last decade with (18)F-DOPA PET-CT scanning as the current diagnostic tool of choice. Although clinical management of CHI has improved significantly with the application of genetic screening and imaging investigations, much remains to be uncovered. This includes a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms for dysregulated insulin release in those patients without known genetic mutations, and the development of biomarkers that could characterize CHI, including long-term prognosis and targeted treatment planning, i.e. 'personalised medicine'. From the perspective of pancreatic imaging, it would be important to achieve greater specificity of diagnosis not only for focal lesions but also for diffuse and atypical forms of the disease.",0
10469362,Gender differences in renal growth and function after uninephrectomy in adult rats,"BACKGROUND: It is known that compensatory renal growth (CRG) following unilateral nephrectomy (UNX) increases both the size of the kidney and its functional capacity; however, few studies have investigated whether differences in CRG exist between the sexes. Our study examined the sex-related differences in remnant kidney growth and function two months following UNX. METHODS: Adult male and female Wistar rats underwent either left UNX or sham operation and recovered for 8 to 10 weeks. Another group of female rats underwent ovariectomy (Ox), with vehicle, estrogen, or testosterone replacement: two-weeks postsurgery animals underwent UNX and recovered for 8 to 10 weeks. Metabolic studies, acute renal function studies [response to acute saline volume expansion (2 to 4% of body wt) or phosphate (Pi) infusions in thyroparathyroidectomized rats (to determine the transport maximum (TmPi)], and renal morphology were assessed at the end of the experimental period. RESULTS: Two months post-UNX, male remnant kidneys grew 114+/-7% of their excised kidney weight (KW), whereas female remnant kidneys grew only 57+/-4% (P<0.05). There was a significant increase in the glomerular volume of male remnant kidneys (126.2+/-13.4%, P<0.001) compared with control kidney volume, whereas there was no change in glomerular volume in female remnant kidneys (20.2+/-16.1%, P = NS). There was also glomerular and tubular damage in the male remnant kidneys, whereas female remnant kidneys were intact. Studies in Ox female rats supplemented with gonadal steroids determined that testosterone is the driving force for the enhanced remnant kidney growth and glomerular hypertrophy. Renal function studies determined that UNX males had significantly higher glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) than UNX females, although the GFR/single KW was not different between the sexes, indicating a proportional increase in GFR. Basal urinary sodium excretion and urine flow rates were significantly higher in anesthetized UNX rats than their sham-operated controls, and urinary sodium excretion and urine flow rates in UNX males were significantly higher than in UNX females. Both male and female UNX rats responded to volume expansion with an exaggerated initial sodium and urine excretion compared with their controls. Phosphate handling was not altered in UNX male rats; however, UNX female rats had increases in fractional Pi excretion that were associated with significant reductions in the maximum capacity for Pi reabsorption (2.10+/-0.07 vs. 3.43+/-0.24 micromol/ml GFR in female controls, P<0.0001). This difference was also observed in Ox rats treated with estrogen and testosterone (2.31+/-0.07 vs. 3.12+/-0.11 micromol/ml GFR, P<0.0007). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that sexual dimorphism exists in remnant kidney growth and function two months following UNX. Indeed, morphological abnormalities and impairment in renal phosphate handling are affected by gonadal steroids by two-months post-UNX. The fact that renal Pi transport was reduced in female but not male UNX rats may also have important implications during periods of high metabolic demand for phosphate in the female.",0
10480357,Genetic variation in the apolipoprotein H (beta2-glycoprotein I) gene affects plasma apolipoprotein H concentrations,"Apolipoprotein H (apoH, protein; APOH, gene) is a single chain glycoprotein that exists in plasma both in a free form and in combination with lipoprotein particles. ApoH has been implicated in several physiologic pathways, including lipid metabolism, coagulation, and the production of antiphospholipid antibodies. The wide range of interindividual variation in plasma apoH levels is thought to be under genetic control, but its molecular basis is unknown. APOH displays a common structural polymorphism with the occurrence of three common alleles (APOH*1, APOH*2, and APOH*3), the APOH*2 allele being the most frequent in all populations. The relationship between the APOH polymorphism and plasma apoH levels is unknown. In this study, we have determined the impact of this APOH polymorphism on apoH levels in 455 normoglycemic non-Hispanic Whites (220 men and 235 women) from the San Luis Valley, Colorado. Mean plasma apoH levels, determined by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were 20.0 +/- 0.2 mg/dl (range: 3.4-31.2 mg/dl) with no significant difference between men and women. In women, but not in men, age had a significant effect on plasma apoH levels explaining 3.4% of its phenotypic variance. ApoH levels also correlated positively with cholesterol (P = 0.015), HDL-cholesterol (P = 0.044), and triglyceride (P = 0.037) in women, but not in men. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) of adjusted plasma apoH levels showed significant association with the APOH polymorphism in both men and women (P < 0.0001), and the APOH polymorphism accounted for 11.4% and 13.6% of the variation in apoH levels in men and women, respectively. Compared with the APOH*1 and APOH*2 alleles, the APOH*3 allele was associated with significantly lower plasma apoH levels. At the molecular level, APOH*3 can be further subdivided into two distinct forms, called APOH*3W and APOH*3B. The APOH*3W form is more common in US Whites and is the result of a missense mutation at codon 316. An ANOVA for the codon 316 polymorphism revealed that this polymorphism is a major determinant of plasma apoH variation (P < 0.0001). This study indicates that common genetic variation in the APOH gene is a significant determinant of plasma apoH levels in non-Hispanics Whites and should be useful in evaluating the role of the APOH genetic variation in various metabolic pathways in which apoH has been implicated.",1
8530022,RNA expression and chromosomal location of the mouse long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene,"The cDNA for mouse long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadl, gene symbol; LCAD, enzyme) was cloned and characterized. The cDNA was obtained by library screening and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The deduced amino acid sequence showed a high degree of homology to both the rat and the human LCAD sequence. Northern analysis of multiple tissues using the mouse Acadl cDNA as a probe showed two bands in all tissues examined. We found a total of three distinct mRNAs for Acadl. These three mRNAs were encoded by a single gene that we mapped to mouse chromosome 1. The three transcripts differed in the 3' untranslated region due to use of alternative polyadenylation sites. Quantitative evaluation of a multitissue Northern blot showed a varied ratio of the larger transcript as compared with the smaller transcripts.",1
8505380,Molecular cloning of a human homologue of Drosophila heterochromatin protein HP1 using anti-centromere autoantibodies with anti-chromo specificity,"We have identified a novel autoantibody specificity in scleroderma that we term anti-chromo. These antibodies recognize several chromosomal antigens with apparent molecular mass of between 23 and 25 kDa, as determined by immunoblots. Anti-chromo autoantibodies occur in 10-15% of sera from patients with anti-centromere antibodies (ACA). We used anti-chromo antibodies to screen a human expression library and obtained cDNA clones encoding a 25 kDa chromosomal autoantigen. DNA sequence analysis reveals this protein to be a human homologue of HP1, a heterochromatin protein of Drosophila melanogaster. We designate our cloned protein HP1Hs alpha. Epitope mapping experiments using both human and Drosophila HP1 reveal that anti-chromo antibodies target a region at the amino terminus of the protein. This region contains a conserved motif, the chromo domain (or HP1/Pc box), first recognized by comparison of Drosophila HP1 with the Polycomb gene product. Both proteins are thought to play a role in creating chromatin structures in which gene expression is suppressed. Anti-chromo thus defines a novel type of autoantibody that recognizes a conserved structural motif found on a number of chromosomal proteins.",1
28626351,Measurement of RF propagation around corners in underground mines and tunnels,"This paper reports measurement results for radio frequency (RF) propagation around 90 degrees  corners in tunnels and underground mines, for vertically, horizontally and longitudinally polarized signals. Measurements of signal power attenuation from a main entry into a crosscut were performed at four frequencies - 455, 915, 2450 and 5800 MHz - that are common to underground radio communication systems. From the measurement data, signal power loss was determined as a function of signal coupling from the main entry into the crosscut. The resultant power loss data show there are many factors that contribute to power attenuation from a main entry into a crosscut, including frequency, antenna polarization and cross-sectional entry dimensions.",0

2661589,Glucose and free fatty acid metabolism in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Evidence for multiple sites of insulin resistance,"The effect of graded, physiologic hyperinsulinemia (+5, +15, +30, +70, +200 microU/ml) on oxidative and nonoxidative pathways of glucose and FFA metabolism was examined in nine lean non-insulin dependent diabetic patients (NIDDM) and in eight age- and weight-matched control subjects. Glucose and FFA metabolism were assessed using stepwise insulin clamp in combination with indirect calorimetry and infusion of [3H]3-glucose/[14C]palmitate. The basal rate of hepatic glucose production (HGP) was higher in NIDDM than in control subjects, and suppression of HGP by insulin was impaired at all but the highest insulin concentration. Glucose disposal was reduced in the NIDD patients at the three highest plasma insulin concentrations, and this was accounted for by defects in both glucose oxidation and nonoxidative glucose metabolism. In NIDDs, suppression of plasma FFA by insulin was impaired at all five insulin steps. This was associated with impaired suppression by insulin of plasma FFA turnover, FFA oxidation (measured by [14C]palmitate) and nonoxidative FFA disposal (an estimate of reesterification of FFA). FFA oxidation and net lipid oxidation (measured by indirect calorimetry) correlated positively with the rate of HGP in the basal state and during the insulin clamp. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that insulin resistance is a general characteristic of glucose and FFA metabolism in NIDDM, and involves both oxidative and nonoxidative pathways. The data also demonstrate that FFA/lipid and glucose metabolism are interrelated in NIDDM, and suggest that an increased rate of FFA/lipid oxidation may contribute to the impaired suppression of HGP and diminished stimulation of glucose oxidation by insulin in these patients.",1
26123588,From Nf1 to Sdhb knockout: Successes and failures in the quest for animal models of pheochromocytoma,"Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL) are rare neuroendocrine tumors characterized by a high frequency of hereditary forms. Based on transcriptome classification, PPGL can be classified in two different clusters. Cluster 1 tumors are caused by mutations in SDHx, VHL and FH genes and are characterized by a pseudohypoxic signature. Cluster 2 PPGL carry mutations in RET, NF1, MAX or TMEM127 genes and display an activation of the MAPK and mTOR signaling pathways. Many genetically engineered and allografted mouse models have been generated these past 30 years to investigate the mechanisms of PPGL tumorigenesis and test new therapeutic strategies. Among them, only Cluster 2-related models have been successful while no Cluster 1-related knockout mouse was so far reported to develop a PPGL. In this review, we present an overview of existing, successful or not, PPGL models, and a description of our own experience on the quest of Sdhb knockout mouse models of PPGL. ",0

21436454,CD40 agonists alter tumor stroma and show efficacy against pancreatic carcinoma in mice and humans,"Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments can restrain antitumor immunity, particularly in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Because CD40 activation can reverse immune suppression and drive antitumor T cell responses, we tested the combination of an agonist CD40 antibody with gemcitabine chemotherapy in a small cohort of patients with surgically incurable PDA and observed tumor regressions in some patients. We reproduced this treatment effect in a genetically engineered mouse model of PDA and found unexpectedly that tumor regression required macrophages but not T cells or gemcitabine. CD40-activated macrophages rapidly infiltrated tumors, became tumoricidal, and facilitated the depletion of tumor stroma. Thus, cancer immune surveillance does not necessarily depend on therapy-induced T cells; rather, our findings demonstrate a CD40-dependent mechanism for targeting tumor stroma in the treatment of cancer.",1

2328408,Hereditary motor system diseases (chronic juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Conditions combining a bilateral pyramidal syndrome with limb and bulbar amyotrophy,"Forty-three patients with hereditary motor system diseases belonging to 17 families were studied. The clinical features consisted of a bilateral pyramidal syndrome, weakness with atrophy and fasciculation of the hands and/or the legs, with or without a bulbar or a pseudobulbar syndrome and without sensory disturbance. Electromyography in 31 cases (including all index cases) showed evidence of denervation. Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity was normal; sensory nerve action potential amplitudes, examined in 11 cases, were also normal. Nerve and muscle biopsies taken in 29 cases (including all index cases) showed neurogenic atrophy in the peroneus brevis muscle and minor changes only in the superficial peroneal nerve. The mean age of onset was 12.06 (range 3-25 years), and progression was very slow. Inheritance appeared to be autosomal recessive. Depending on the clinical presentation, the patients were subdivided into three groups comprising (1) upper limb and sometimes bulbar amyotrophy with a bilateral pyramidal syndrome (17 patients: 11 familial and 6 isolated); (2) spastic paraplegia with peroneal muscular atrophy (14 patients: 11 familial and 3 isolated); and (3) a spastic pseudobulbar form (12 patients in a large kinship). These entities are discussed and compared with other cases reported in the literature.",1

17488330,Increased apoptosis and angiogenesis in gastric low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type lymphoma by Helicobacter heilmannii infection in C57/BL6 mice,"Helicobacter heilmannii has been reported to cause gastric low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type (MALT) lymphoma, but its precise pathophysiological mechanism remains to be clarified. We recently established a model of gastric B-cell MALT lymphoma in C57BL/6 mice by means of peroral infection of H. heilmannii primarily obtained from cynomolgus monkeys. Using this model, macroscopic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic observations of MALT lymphomas were carried out in order to examine the development of apoptosis and angiogenesis. Enhancement of the microvascular network and an increase in vascular endothelial growth factor-A were detected in the central region of the MALT lymphoma tissue in the infected mouse stomach, while vascular endothelial growth factor-C was detected at the margins of the MALT lymphomas. In addition, many H. heilmannii-invaded parietal cells showed caspase-3 immunoreactivity in the fundic mucosal tissue surrounding the MALT lymphoma. In conclusion, in H. heilmannii-induced MALT lymphoma, enhanced immunoreactivity of vascular endothelial growth factor-A and factor-C was observed in areas encircled by increased parietal cell apoptosis, which indicates the pathophysiological relevance of both angiogenesis and apoptosis in MALT lymphoma formation.",0
8911609,Unusual xanthomas in a young patient with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and type III hyperlipoproteinemia,"We report on a 20-year-old man with the combination of two independent familial lipoprotein disorders: heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP). Familial hypercholesterolemia was diagnosed by elevated total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and family history. By denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, a G --> A splice donor mutation in intron 3 of the proband's low density lipoprotein receptor gene was identified as the underlying molecular defect. This mutation was described previously as a receptor-negative founder mutation in Norway (FH-Elverum) and subsequently in 6 unrelated heterozygous English patients, creating a severe phenotype of familial hypercholesterolemia. Type III HLP was confirmed by homozygosity for apolipoprotein (apo) E2 and an elevated ratio of very low density lipoprotein cholesterol to serum triglycerides (0.40; normal ratio about 0.20). The patient has unusual flat xanthomas in the interdigital webs of the hands which are normally not found in either disease. These dermatological findings might therefore be indicative of the rare combination of both disorders of lipoprotein metabolism in one individual.",1
18650924,Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATM orthologue suppresses break-induced chromosome translocations,"Chromosome translocations are frequently associated with many types of blood-related cancers and childhood sarcomas. Detection of chromosome translocations assists in diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of these diseases; however, despite their importance to such diseases, the molecular mechanisms leading to chromosome translocations are not well understood. The available evidence indicates a role for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in their origin. Here we develop a yeast-based system that induces a reciprocal chromosome translocation by formation and ligation of breaks on two different chromosomes. We show that interchromosomal end joining is efficiently suppressed by the Tel1- and Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2-dependent pathway; this is distinct from the role of Tel1 in telomeric integrity and from Mec1- and Tel1-dependent checkpoint controls. Suppression of DSB-induced chromosome translocations depends on the kinase activity of Tel1 and Dun1, and the damage-induced phosphorylation of Sae2 and histone H2AX proteins. Tel1- and Sae2-dependent tethering and promotion of 5' to 3' degradation of broken chromosome ends discourage error-prone NHEJ and interchromosomal NHEJ, preserving chromosome integrity on DNA damage. Our results indicate that, like human ATM, Tel1 serves as a key regulator for chromosome integrity in the pathway that reduces the risk for DSB-induced chromosome translocations, and are probably pertinent to the oncogenic chromosome translocations in ATM-deficient cells.",1
1920800,"An analysis of the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide during halothane, isoflurane, or enflurane anesthesia in humans","To analyze the effects of halothane, isoflurane, or enflurane on the ventilatory response to CO2, minute volume (VE), respiratory rate (f), occlusion pressure, mean inspiratory flow rate (VT/TI), and effective elastance (Pmax/VT) were measured in 26 patients during quiet breathing and when the respiratory system was stressed by CO2. Comparison was made at equipotent anesthetic concentration (1 MAC) and all measurements were made in the absence of surgical stimulation. Respiratory rate and Pmax/VT were unchanged in all groups after end-tidal CO2 was elevated. By contrast, VE, VT/TI, and occlusion pressure increased in all the groups when the respiratory system was stressed by CO2. Among the parameters tested delta VE/delta PaCO2 and delta VT/TI/delta PaCO2 were significantly (P less than 0.05) greater during halothane anesthesia than during isoflurane or enflurane anesthesia. We conclude that, at equipotent anesthetic concentrations, isoflurane and enflurane depress CO2 chemosensitivity more than halothane does, and that such effect is primarily related to the greater depressant effects of isoflurane and enflurane on the respiratory driving mechanisms.",0
17353345,The macrophage CD163 surface glycoprotein is an erythroblast adhesion receptor,"Erythropoiesis occurs in erythroblastic islands, where developing erythroblasts closely interact with macrophages. The adhesion molecules that govern macrophage-erythroblast contact have only been partially defined. Our previous work has implicated the rat ED2 antigen, which is highly expressed on the surface of macrophages in erythroblastic islands, in erythroblast binding. In particular, the monoclonal antibody ED2 was found to inhibit erythroblast binding to bone marrow macrophages. Here, we identify the ED2 antigen as the rat CD163 surface glycoprotein, a member of the group B scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) family that has previously been shown to function as a receptor for hemoglobin-haptoglobin (Hb-Hp) complexes and is believed to contribute to the clearance of free hemoglobin. CD163 transfectants and recombinant protein containing the extracellular domain of CD163 supported the adhesion of erythroblastic cells. Furthermore, we identified a 13-amino acid motif (CD163p2) corresponding to a putative interaction site within the second scavenger receptor domain of CD163 that could mediate erythroblast binding. Finally, CD163p2 promoted erythroid expansion in vitro, suggesting that it enhanced erythroid proliferation and/or survival, but did not affect differentiation. These findings identify CD163 on macrophages as an adhesion receptor for erythroblasts in erythroblastic islands, and suggest a regulatory role for CD163 during erythropoiesis.",1
32761800,Hexyl gallate for the control of citrus canker caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp citri,"Brazil is the biggest producer of sweet oranges and the main exporter of concentrated orange juice in the world. Among the diseases that affect citriculture, Asiatic citrus canker, caused by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas citri, represents one of the most significant threats. The current Brazilian legislation regulating the control of citrus canker no longer requires the eradication of affected trees in states where the incidence of the disease is high. Instead, control involves disease control measures, including periodic preventative spraying of copper compounds. The long-term use of copper for plant disease control has raised concerns about environmental accumulation and toxicity, as well as the selective pressure it exerts leading to the emergence of copper-resistant X. citri strains. Here, we evaluated hexyl gallate (G6) as an alternative to copper compounds for citrus plant protection. G6 was able to protect citrus nursery trees against X. citri infection. Thirty days after inoculation, the trees treated with G6 developed 0.5 lesions/cm(2) leaf area compared with the 2.84 lesions/cm(2) observed in the untreated control trees. Also, G6 did not interfere with germination and root development of tomato, lettuce, and arugula, which is consistent with our previous data showing that G6 is safe for tissue culture cell lines. Membrane permeability tests showed that the primary target of G6 is the bacterial outer membrane. Finally, we could not isolate spontaneous X. citri mutants resistant to G6 nor induce resistance to G6 after long-term exposures to increasing concentrations of the compound, which suggests that G6 may have multiple cellular targets. This study demonstrated that G6 is a promising candidate for the development and use in citrus canker management.",0
28411234,Phenotype of GABA-transaminase deficiency,"OBJECTIVE: We report a case series of 10 patients with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-transaminase deficiency including a novel therapeutic trial and an expanded phenotype. METHODS: Case ascertainment, literature review, comprehensive evaluations, and long-term treatment with flumazenil. RESULTS: All patients presented with neonatal or early infantile-onset encephalopathy; other features were hypotonia, hypersomnolence, epilepsy, choreoathetosis, and accelerated linear growth. EEGs showed burst-suppression, modified hypsarrhythmia, multifocal spikes, and generalized spike-wave. Five of the 10 patients are currently alive with age at last follow-up between 18 months and 9.5 years. Treatment with continuous flumazenil was implemented in 2 patients. One patient, with a milder phenotype, began treatment at age 21 months and has continued for 20 months with improved alertness and less excessive adventitious movements. The second patient had a more severe phenotype and was 7 years of age at initiation of flumazenil, which was not continued. CONCLUSIONS: GABA-transaminase deficiency presents with neonatal or infantile-onset encephalopathy including hypersomnolence and choreoathetosis. A widened phenotypic spectrum is reported as opposed to lethality by 2 years of age. The GABA-A benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil may represent a therapeutic strategy.",1
19420170,Accuracy of commercial and reference susceptibility testing methods for detecting vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus,"We compared the results obtained with six commercial MIC test systems (Etest, MicroScan, Phoenix, Sensititre, Vitek Legacy, and Vitek 2 systems) and three reference methods (agar dilution, disk diffusion, and vancomycin [VA] agar screen [VScr]) with the results obtained by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution (BMD) reference method for the detection of VA-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA). A total of 129 S. aureus isolates (VA MICs by previous BMD tests, <or=1 microg/ml [n = 60 strains], 2 microg/ml [n = 24], 4 microg/ml [n = 36], or 8 microg/ml [n = 9]) were selected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strain collection. The results of BMD with Difco Mueller-Hinton broth were used as the standard for data analysis. Essential agreement (percent +/-1 dilution) ranged from 98 to 100% for all methods except the method with the Vitek Legacy system, for which it was 90.6%. Of the six commercial MIC systems tested, the Sensititre, Vitek Legacy, and Vitek 2 systems tended to categorize VISA strains as susceptible (i.e., they undercalled resistance); the MicroScan and Phoenix systems and Etest tended to categorize susceptible strains as VISA; and the Vitek Legacy system tended to categorize VISA strains as resistant (i.e., it overcalled resistance). Disk diffusion categorized all VISA strains as susceptible. No susceptible strains (MICs <or= 2 microg/ml) grew on the VScr, but all strains for which the VA MICs were 8 microg/ml grew on the VScr. Only 12 (33.3%) strains for which the VA MICs were 4 microg/ml grew on VScr. The differentiation of isolates for which the VA MICs were 2 or 4 microg/ml was difficult for most systems and methods, including the reference methods.",0
18958021,Efficient analysis of photonic crystal devices by Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps,"An efficient numerical method based on the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) maps of the unit cells is developed for accurate simulations of two-dimensional photonic crystal (PhC) devices in the frequency domain. The DtN map of a unit cell is an operator that maps the wave field on the boundary of the cell to its normal derivative and it can be approximated by a small matrix. Using the DtN maps of the regular and defect unit cells, we can avoid computations in the interiors of the unit cells and calculate the wave field only on the edges. This gives rise to a significant reduction in the total number of unknowns. Reasonably accurate solutions can be obtained using 10 to 15 unknowns for each unit cell. In contrast, standard finite element, finite difference or plane wave expansion methods may require a few hundreds unknowns for each unit cell at the same level of accuracy. We illustrate our method by a number of examples, including waveguide bends, branches, microcavities coupled with waveguides, waveguides with stubs, etc.",0
8626479,A new function for adducin. Calcium/calmodulin-regulated capping of the barbed ends of actin filaments,"Adducin is a membrane skeleton protein originally described in human erythrocytes that promotes the binding of spectrin to actin and also binds directly to actin and bundles actin filaments. Adducin is associated with regions of cell-cell contact in nonerythroid cells, where it is believed to play a role in regulating the assembly of the spectrin-actin membrane skeleton. In this study we demonstrate a novel function for adducin; it completely blocks elongation and depolymerization at the barbed (fast growing) ends of actin filaments, thus functioning as a barbed end capping protein (Kcap approximately 100 nM). This barbed end capping activity requires the intact adducin molecule and is not provided by the NH2-terminal globular head domains alone nor by the COOH-terminal extended tail domains, which were previously shown to contain the spectrin-actin binding, calmodulin binding, and phosphorylation sites. A novel difference between adducin and other previously described capping proteins is that it is down-regulated by calmodulin in the presence of calcium. The association of stoichiometric amounts of adducin with the short erythrocyte actin filaments in the membrane skeleton indicates that adducin could be the functional barbed end capper in erythrocytes and play a role in restricting actin filament length. Our experiments also suggest novel possibilities for calcium regulation of actin filament assembly by adducin in erythrocytes and at cell-cell contact sites in nonerythroid cells.",1
25105332,Posttraumatic stress among youths in juvenile detention,"An estimated 1.8 million juveniles were arrested in the United States for delinquency in 2009. Previous studies indicate high rates of exposure to traumatic events and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms for these youths. This study examined PTS in a sample of 170 youths in juvenile detention. The results of this study reveal higher rates of PTS symptoms (21%) compared to national rates (6%). The data also suggest youths suffering from more PTS symptoms also report higher depression, anxiety, anger, family relationship worries, thought problems, and attention problems. These factors provide a direction for continued practice targeting these youths. ",0
19295602,Activation of CaMKII in single dendritic spines during long-term potentiation,"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) plays a central part in long-term potentiation (LTP), which underlies some forms of learning and memory. Here we monitored the spatiotemporal dynamics of CaMKII activation in individual dendritic spines during LTP using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, in combination with two-photon glutamate uncaging. Induction of LTP and associated spine enlargement in single spines triggered transient ( approximately 1 min) CaMKII activation restricted to the stimulated spines. CaMKII in spines was specifically activated by NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, presumably by nanodomain Ca(2+) near the channels, in response to glutamate uncaging and depolarization, respectively. The high degree of compartmentalization and channel specificity of CaMKII signalling allow stimuli-specific spatiotemporal patterns of CaMKII signalling and may be important for synapse-specificity of synaptic plasticity.",1
32074815,Analysis of mortality relative factors in patients with ventricular septal rupture complicating myocardial infarction,"Objective: To examine the mortality rate and relative factors associate with ventricular septal rupture in myocardial infarction patients. Methods: A total of 51 patients who suffered from myocardial infarction complicating with ventricular septal rupture received operative procedures between January 2005 and December 2018 in Department of Cardiac Surgery, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, were retrospectively analyzed. There were 34 males and 17 females, with an age of (63+/-8) years (range: 44 to 82 years). The time between ventricular septal rupture and surgical procedure was (44+/-39) days (range: 3 to 187 days). The t test and chi(2) test were used for univariate analysis, Logistics regression model was used for multivariate analysis of in-hospital mortality relative factors. Results: There were 8 patients dead in hospital, 43 patients survived, the overall mortality rate was 15.7% in hospital. The post-operation mortality rate was 2/3 of who suffered ventricular septal rupture and underwent operation within 1 week, but it's markedly decreased to 6.5% if the time over 4 weeks. Univariate analysis showed that renal failure before operation, creatinine before operation, left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac function (New York Heart Association) grade , severe tricuspid regurgitation, dialysis post-operation, creatinine of the first day of post-operation, the time between and operation more than 4 weeks were in-hospital mortality relative factors. Multivariate analysis reflected that advanced age (OR=1.32, 95%CI: 1.05 to 1.75, P=0.033), cardiac function grade  (OR=2.25, 95%CI: 1.62 to 2.82, P=0.003), severe tricuspid regurgitation (OR= 1.82, 95%CI: 1.31 to 2.43, P=0.001), renal failure before operation (OR=1.78, 95%CI: 1.26 to 2.32, P=0.015), the time between ventricular septal rupture and operation less than 1 week (OR=2.50, 95%CI: 1.52 to 2.98, P=0.012), were independent in-hospital mortality relative factors. Conclusions: The surgery operation is an effective way to deal with ventricular septal rupture combined with myocardial infarction. The independent relative factors of in-hospital mortality are advanced age, cardiac function grade , renal failure before operation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, the time between ventricular septal rupture and operation less than 1 week.",0
9625172,Molecular evidence for multifocal papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum in patients with germline BRCA1 mutations,"BACKGROUND: Papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum (PSCP) diffusely involves peritoneal surfaces, while it spares or only superficially involves the ovaries. PSCP is histologically indistinguishable from serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma, and it may develop years after oophorectomy. The molecular pathogenesis of PSCP remains unresolved, although preliminary data suggest a multifocal origin in some cases. Patients with germline BRCA1 mutations may develop PSCP in addition to breast and ovarian carcinomas. The purpose of this study was to utilize the androgen receptor (AR) gene locus to test the hypothesis that some cases of PSCP have a multifocal origin and to determine if patients with germline BRCA1 mutations develop multifocal PSCP. METHODS: Specimens of normal and tumor tissues from 22 women with PSCP were obtained, and DNA was extracted. The AR gene locus was evaluated for patterns of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and X-chromosome inactivation. The methylation-sensitive Hpa II restriction enzyme was used to differentiate the active and inactive X chromosomes. Germline BRCA1 mutation status of the patients was determined previously. RESULTS: Genetic analysis of tumor specimens indicated that five (23%) of 22 case subjects had patterns of selective LOH at the AR locus, consistent with multifocal, polyclonal disease origin. Two patients with selective LOH also had alternating X-chromosome inactivation patterns. Patients with germline BRCA1 mutations were more likely to have evidence of multifocal disease (two-sided Fisher's exact test, P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that PSCP has a multifocal origin in at least some cases. Furthermore, patients with germline BRCA1 mutations are more likely to develop multifocal PSCP than are patients without BRCA1 mutations.",1
30124850,"Mice lacking the transcobalamin-vitamin B12 receptor, CD320, suffer from anemia and reproductive deficits when fed vitamin B12-deficient diet","In humans, poor nutrition, malabsorption and variation in cobalamin (vitamin B12) metabolic genes are associated with hematological, neurological and developmental pathologies. Cobalamin is transported from blood into tissues via the transcobalamin (TC) receptor encoded by the CD320 gene. We created mice carrying a targeted deletion of the mouse ortholog, Cd320. Knockout (KO) mice lacking this TC receptor have elevated levels of plasma methylmalonic acid and homocysteine but are otherwise healthy, viable, fertile and not anemic. To challenge the Cd320 KO mice we maintained them on a vitamin B12-deficient diet. After 5 weeks on this diet, reproductive failure develops in Cd320 KO females but not males. In vitro, homozygous Cd320 KO embryos from cobalamin-deficient Cd320 KO dams develop normally to embryonic day (E) 3.5, while in vivo, few uterine decidual implantation sites are observed at E7.5, suggesting that embryos perish around the time of implantation. Dietary restriction of vitamin B12 induces a severe macrocytic anemia in Cd320 KO mice after 10-12 months while control mice on this diet are anemia-free up to 2 years. Despite the severe anemia, cobalamin-deficient KO mice do not exhibit obvious neurological symptoms. Our results with Cd320 KO mice suggest that an alternative mechanism exists for mice to transport cobalamin independent of the Cd320 encoded receptor. Our findings with deficient diet are consistent with historical and epidemiological data suggesting that low vitamin B12 levels in humans are associated with infertility and developmental abnormalities. Our Cd320 KO mouse model is an ideal model system for studying vitamin B12 deficiency.",1
2307462,An insertion deletion polymorphism in the signal peptide of the human apolipoprotein B gene,"In this communication we report the genetic properties of an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the signal peptide of the human apolipoprotein B (apo b) gene. There are two alleles of the apo B signal peptide; one codes for a peptide 27 amino acids in length and the other a peptide only 24 amino acids in length. Using the polymerase chain reaction the difference of nine nucleotides between the two alleles is readily detectable after electrophoresis of the amplification products. The relative frequencies of the Ins and Del alleles are 0.655 and 0.345, respectively. The apo B signal peptide genotypes are transmitted in a manner consistent with an autosomal codominant mode of inheritance with two alleles.",1
15358736,The developmental genetics of auditory hair cells,"Loss of auditory hair cells (AHCs) is a major cause of human deafness. Considerable effort has been devoted to unraveling how these mechanotransducers of sound are specified, with a view to correcting hearing loss by gene or stem cell therapies. Recent work on signaling cascades, particularly lateral inhibition and planar cell polarity, has begun to tie together some of the known pathways. Mutations in mice and humans that cause hearing and/or balance disorders are also shedding light on how AHCs are specified and, maintained and handle ion flux. Studies on some of these genes are beginning to provide insights into the more complex genetics of later onset forms of hearing loss. Progress has also been made in solving some long-term goals of auditory biology. Cadherin23 has been identified as a component of AHC stereocilia tip links, and progress has been made towards identifying the elusive AHC mechanoreceptor channel. Preliminary steps have also been taken towards inner-ear gene therapy, and in the engineering of embryonic stem cells for eventual cell therapies. Mammals cannot regenerate AHCs, but birds and other lower vertebrates can. Genomic tools have now been brought to bear on this problem with the aim of deciphering the molecular basis of this regenerative capability. The combination of new genomic tools and the many mouse and chicken embryological and genetic resources should increasingly provide new insights into how AHCs are programed and maintained.",1
18227514,MicroRNA-373 induces expression of genes with complementary promoter sequences,"Recent studies have shown that microRNA (miRNA) regulates gene expression by repressing translation or directing sequence-specific degradation of complementary mRNA. Here, we report new evidence in which miRNA may also function to induce gene expression. By scanning gene promoters in silico for sequences complementary to known miRNAs, we identified a putative miR-373 target site in the promoter of E-cadherin. Transfection of miR-373 and its precursor hairpin RNA (pre-miR-373) into PC-3 cells readily induced E-cadherin expression. Knockdown experiments confirmed that induction of E-cadherin by pre-miR-373 required the miRNA maturation protein Dicer. Further analysis revealed that cold-shock domain-containing protein C2 (CSDC2), which possesses a putative miR-373 target site within its promoter, was also readily induced in response to miR-373 and pre-miR-373. Furthermore, enrichment of RNA polymerase II was detected at both E-cadherin and CSDC2 promoters after miR-373 transfection. Mismatch mutations to miR-373 indicated that gene induction was specific to the miR-373 sequence. Transfection of promoter-specific dsRNAs revealed that the concurrent induction of E-cadherin and CSDC2 by miR-373 required the miRNA target sites in both promoters. In conclusion, we have identified a miRNA that targets promoter sequences and induces gene expression. These findings reveal a new mode by which miRNAs may regulate gene expression.",1
7737113,Potassium-inhibited processing of IL-1 beta in human monocytes,"Agents that deplete cells of K+ without grossly disrupting the plasma membrane were found to stimulate the cleavage of pro-interleukin (IL)-1 beta to mature IL-1 beta. Agents examined in this study included staphylococcal alpha-toxin and gramicidin, both of which selectively permeabilize plasma membranes for monovalent ions, the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin, and the Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor ouabain. K+ depletion by brief hypotonic shock also triggered processing of pro-IL-1 beta. The central role of K+ depletion for inducing IL-1 beta maturation was demonstrated in cells permeabilized with alpha-toxin: processing of pro-IL-1 beta was totally blocked when cells were suspended in medium that contained high K+, but could be induced by replacing extracellular K+ with Na+, choline+ or sucrose. To test whether K+ flux might also be important in physiological situations, monocytes were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 1-2 h to trigger pro-IL-1 beta synthesis, and transferred to K(+)-rich medium. This maneuver totally suppressed IL-1 beta maturation. Even after 16 h, however, removal of K+ from the medium resulted in rapid processing and export of IL-1 beta. Ongoing export of mature IL-1 beta from cells stimulated with LPS for 2-6 h could also be arrested by transfer to K(+)-rich medium. Moreover, a combination of two K+ channel blockers inhibited processing of IL-1 beta in LPS-stimulated monocytes. We hypothesize that K+ movement and local K+ concentrations directly or indirectly influence the action of interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE) and, possibly, of related intracellular proteases.",0
17258512,Prevalence of thyroid cancer in familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome and the role of screening ultrasound examinations,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Thyroid carcinoma is an extraintestinal manifestation of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) syndrome, but the precise risk is unknown. The optimal approach for thyroid cancer screening has not been established. We sought to define the prevalence of thyroid cancer and the role of screening ultrasound in FAP patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 51 patients with a proven diagnosis of FAP at a single tertiary institution. Clinical records, genetic test results, ultrasound examinations, and histopathology were reviewed. RESULTS: Papillary thyroid cancer was diagnosed in 6 female patients (12%). The mean age of thyroid cancer diagnosis was 33 years, and mean tumor size was 12 mm. However, all patients had additional malignant foci that were small (1-9 mm), and none had suspicious features of malignancy on ultrasound. Of 28 patients who had at least one screening ultrasound, 22 (79%) had thyroid nodules, and 2 (7%) had papillary thyroid carcinoma. Of those with nodules, 68% had multinodular disease. A follow-up ultrasound in 12 patients after a mean of 15 months revealed no changes in either the number or size of nodules. CONCLUSIONS: The 12% prevalence of thyroid cancer in this series of FAP patients is significantly higher than in previous reports. Among patients undergoing screening ultrasound, 7% had thyroid cancer. Nodular thyroid disease is very common in FAP. Because small nodules (<9 mm) might also be malignant, close follow-up with ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration might be warranted.",0
12165682,Influence of peak VO2 and muscle fiber type on the efficiency of moderate exercise,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine if %Type I fibers and/or aerobic fitness (as peak .VO(2)) would predict Delta efficiency (DeltaEff) and Delta.VO(2)/Deltawork rate (WR) for moderate (below lactate threshold <LT) constant work rate exercise in subjects with diverse level of fitness and fiber type. METHODS: Twenty-two subjects (15 male, 23 +/- 6 yr) heterogenous for fitness (peak .VO(2): 43.9 +/- 7.1 mL.kg(-1).min(-1)) were tested. On 3 different days, each subject performed constant load exercise for 6 min at work rates corresponding to 30, 50, 70, and 90% LT, separated by 6 min of 10% LT pedaling. After a short rest, each subject then completed 8 min of exercise at a WR corresponding to 50% of the difference between LT and peak .VO(2) (Delta50%). The mean .VO(2) determined for the last 3 min of each <LT WR was regressed against the absolute WR for each subject and trial. RESULTS: The group mean Delta.VO(2)/DeltaWR was 10.1 mL.min(-1).W(-1) (range 8.6-11.2 mL.min(-1).W(-1)), whereas the mean DeltaEff was 28.0% (range 24.5-32.0%); both were significantly inversely correlated with each other (r = 0.972, P < 0.0001). DeltaEff was significantly negatively, and Delta.VO(2)/DeltaWR positively, correlated with peak .VO(2)(r = -0.51 and 0.57, respectively; both P < 0.01), but not to % Type I fibers (r = 0.01 and 0.11, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that aerobic fitness affects the energetic response to changes in power output during moderate exercise, such that the more aerobically fit a subject, the greater the increase in oxygen cost (.VO(2)) (reduced efficiency) as work rate increases. Further, Delta.VO(2)/DeltaWR reflects the inverse of DeltaEff for moderate-intensity exercise in healthy fed subjects.",0
3456164,Deficiency of adenosine deaminase in the wasted mouse,"Wasted (wst) is a spontaneous mutation with autosomal recessive inheritance. Abnormally low levels of adenosine deaminase have been found in erythrocytes from the wasted mouse. Enzyme activity in wst/wst mice is reduced to 38% of that found in the erythrocytes from control mice, and the apparent Km for adenosine is reduced to 51% of control. These changes imply an alteration in the catalytic properties of the enzyme arising from a change in the primary structure of the protein. We postulate that wasted is a mutation in the structural gene for adenosine deaminase. In man, the autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency is associated, in about one-third of cases, with a deficiency of adenosine deaminase. Wasted mice are immunodeficient, develop neurological abnormalities, and die soon after weaning. These features are shared with the human syndrome. We therefore further suggest that the wasted mouse is an animal model for this form of severe combined immunodeficiency that will have potential use in gene-therapy studies.",1

We have tested this prediction by determining the visual reaction time of cats over a range of spatial frequencies and contrasts by training them to respond quickly when a vertical sine-wave grating was presented. At 50% contrast, the cat's visual reaction time increased monotonically from 0.25-2.0 cpd (cycle/deg). At every spatial frequency tested, the cat's reaction time increased monotonically as contrast decreased. By determining contrast threshold (70% detection) at each spatial frequency, it was possible to determine reaction times for different spatial frequencies at equal physical contrasts and equal ",0
16208318,CCL5-CCR5 interaction provides antiapoptotic signals for macrophage survival during viral infection,"Host defense against viruses probably depends on targeted death of infected host cells and then clearance of cellular corpses by macrophages. For this process to be effective, the macrophage must presumably avoid its own virus-induced death. Here we identify one such mechanism. We show that mice lacking the chemokine Ccl5 are immune compromised to the point of delayed viral clearance, excessive airway inflammation and respiratory death after mouse parainfluenza or human influenza virus infection. Virus-inducible levels of Ccl5 are required to prevent apoptosis of virus-infected mouse macrophages in vivo and mouse and human macrophages ex vivo. The protective effect of Ccl5 requires activation of the Ccr5 chemokine receptor and consequent bilateral activation of G(alphai)-PI3K-AKT and G(alphai)-MEK-ERK signaling pathways. The antiapoptotic action of chemokine signaling may therefore allow scavengers to finally stop the host cell-to-cell infectious process.",1
18709848,Animal model of grading skeletal muscle contusion due to blunt impact in rats,"OBJECTIVE: To establish a new animal model of grading skeletal muscle contusions that could be controllable and repetitive. METHODS: The rats' gastrocnemius was injured by a new weight-dropping device designed. The force acting on gastrocnemius with a comparatively constant duration and inducing elastic deformation of the gastrocnemius was expressed with velocity (v) and deformation (DF). Instant velocity was changed to create gastrocnemius contusions. Pathological changes of gastrocnemius were graded by the gross and histological examinations of 39 rats. RESULTS: At low level of impact (v: 2 m/s, DF: 5.5 mm), mild injuries were detected in epimysium and superficial layer of gastrocnemius. At moderate level of impact (v: 2.5 m/s, DF: 6.5 mm), the injuries were observed in epimysium and whole gastrocnemius. At high level of impact (v: 3 m/s, DF: 7.5 mm), severe injuries were seen deeper to soleus with more extensive skeletal muscle damage. CONCLUSION: Grading of skeletal muscle blunt force contusion is created by parameter of velocity and muscle deformation. The model could be used for further research on skeletal muscle contusions.",0
25544610,Peters plus syndrome mutations disrupt a noncanonical ER quality-control mechanism,"BACKGROUND: O-fucose is added to cysteine-rich domains called thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) by protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) and is elongated with glucose by beta3-glucosyltransferase (B3GLCT). Mutations in B3GLCT result in Peters plus syndrome (PPS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by eye and other developmental defects. Although 49 putative targets are known, the function of the disaccharide and its role in PPS remain unexplored. RESULTS: Here we show that while POFUT2 is required for secretion of all targets tested, B3GLCT only affects the secretion of a subset, consistent with the observation that B3GLCT mutant phenotypes in PPS patients are less severe than embryonic lethal phenotypes of Pofut2-null mice. O-glycosylation occurs cotranslationally, as TSRs fold. Mass spectral analysis reveals that TSRs from mature, secreted protein are stoichiometrically modified with the disaccharide, whereas TSRs from protein still folding in the ER are partially modified, suggesting that O-glycosylation marks folded TSRs and promotes ER exit. In vitro unfolding assays demonstrate that fucose and glucose stabilize folded TSRs in an additive manner. In vitro refolding assays under redox conditions showed that POFUT2 recognizes, glycosylates, and stabilizes the folded form of TSRs, resulting in a net acceleration of folding. CONCLUSIONS: While known ER quality-control machinery rely on identifying and tagging unfolded proteins, we find that POFUT2 and B3GLCT mediate a noncanonical ER quality-control mechanism that recognizes folded TSRs and stabilizes them by glycosylation. Our findings provide a molecular basis for the defects observed in PPS and potential targets that contribute to the pathology.",1

15863807,Alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase polymorphisms in men with type I and Type II alcoholism,"OBJECTIVE: The authors examined the genetic polymorphisms of alcohol dehydrogenase 2 and 3 (ADH2 and ADH3) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) in patients diagnosed as having Cloninger's type I or type II alcoholism. METHOD: Seventy-two alcoholic men and 38 nonalcoholic, healthy men were tested for the distribution of genotypes and alleles of ADH2, ADH3, and ALDH2. Forty-eight of the alcoholic men had type I alcoholism, and 24 had type II alcoholism. RESULTS: The frequencies of ADH2*1 and ADH3*2 alleles were significantly higher in men with type II alcoholism than in men with type I alcoholism and healthy men. The frequency of the ALDH2*1 allele was significantly higher in men with alcohol dependence than in healthy men. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic characteristics of alcohol dehydrogenases in men with type I alcoholism were similar to those of healthy men, and the genetic characteristics of aldehyde dehydrogenase in men with type I alcoholism were similar to those of men with type II alcoholism. These findings suggest that the genetic characteristics of alcohol metabolism in type I alcoholism fall between nonalcoholism and type II alcoholism.",1
24146607,Model of fission yeast cell shape driven by membrane-bound growth factors and the cytoskeleton,"Fission yeast serves as a model for how cellular polarization machinery consisting of signaling molecules and the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton regulates cell shape. In this work, we develop mathematical models to investigate how these cells maintain a tubular shape of approximately constant diameter. Many studies identify active Cdc42, found in a cap at the inner membrane of growing cell tips, as an important regulator of local cell wall remodeling, likely through control of exocyst tethering and the targeting of other polarity-enhancing structures. First, we show that a computational model with Cdc42-dependent local cell wall remodeling under turgor pressure predicts a relationship between spatial extent of growth signal and cell diameter that is in agreement with prior experiments. Second, we model the consequences of feedback between cell shape and distribution of Cdc42 growth signal at cell tips. We show that stability of cell diameter over successive cell divisions places restrictions on their mutual dependence. We argue that simple models where the spatial extent of the tip growth signal relies solely on geometrical alignment of confined microtubules might lead to unstable width regulation. Third, we study a computational model that combines a growth signal distributed over a characteristic length scale (as, for example, by a reaction-diffusion mechanism) with an axis-sensing microtubules system that places landmarks at positions where microtubule tips touch the cortex. A two-dimensional implementation of this model leads to stable cell diameter for a wide range of parameters. Changes to the parameters of this model reproduce straight, bent, and bulged cell shapes, and we discuss how this model is consistent with other observed cell shapes in mutants. Our work provides an initial quantitative framework for understanding the regulation of cell shape in fission yeast, and a scaffold for understanding this process on a more molecular level in the future.

8100293,Mild cystic fibrosis and normal or borderline sweat test in patients with the 3849 + 10 kb C-->T mutation,"Different mutations in the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene appear to contribute to heterogeneity of the CF phenotype. We investigated 15 patients with CF who have the 3849 + 10 kb C-->T mutation. All were Ashkenazi Jews. Their clinical features were compared with those of CF patients with the delta F508/delta F508, W1282X/W1282X, W1282X/delta F508 mutations, which are known to be associated with a severe disease. Patients with the 3849 + 10 kb mutation were older, had been diagnosed as having CF at a more advanced age, and were in a better nutritional state. Sweat chloride values were normal (below 60 mmol/L) in 5 3849 + 10 kb patients (33%). 4 of these patients and 6 others (total 66%) had normal pancreatic function. However, age-adjusted pulmonary function did not differ between the two groups. None of the patients with 3849 + 10 kb C-->T had had meconium ileus or had liver disease or diabetes mellitus. We conclude that this mutation is associated with a mild type of CF.",1
17680275,Blood pressure in the first year of life in healthy infants born at term,"Neonatal hypertension occurs in up to 2% of neonatal intensive care survivors and in up to 3% of all neonates. Normal blood pressure (BP) measurements are required to diagnose and manage appropriately both hypotension and hypertension in the neonate and infant. The aim of this study was to provide normative BP measurements during the first year of life of healthy infants born at term, using an oscillometric method. Neonates were enrolled from August 2003 to August 2005. Exclusion criteria included: infants of mothers with hypertension or diabetes of any type, use of illicit substances, congenital or chromosomal anomaly, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit or possible sepsis. There were 406 infants enrolled, with 150 children followed at 6 months of age and 118 children at 12 months of age. There were no differences in BP measurements at 6 months or 12 months of age by gender, weight or height. A BP measurement above the 90th percentile on day 2 or at 6 months was not predictive of a BP above the 90th percentile at 12 months of age. Higher systolic and diastolic measurements at 6 months and 12 months were found, in comparison to those in previous studies using ultrasonic devices. The findings of this study provide normative BP values for infants during their first year of life, using the oscillometric method, the most frequently used method in paediatric, neonatal intensive care and emergency departments.",0

517664,Interaction between the baroreceptor and Bezold-Jarisch reflexes,"The interaction between the carotid baroreflex and Bezold-Jarisch (BJ) reflex (intravenously administered veratridine) was studied in anesthetized rabbits after aortic nerve section. The carotid sinuses were vascularly isolated to regulate the intrasinus pressure (ISP). The extent of BJ reflex bradycardia and hypotension was progressively diminished as the ISP was elevated stepwise. When the carotid baroreflex was not operative by holding the ISP constant at control, the BJ reflex changes in heart rate (HR) and systemic arterial pressure (SAP) were not significantly different from those induced at the normal condition. Thus the calculated baroreflex static loop gain was greatly decreased during the BJ reflex. However, sinus denervation, analogous to keeping ISP below 50 mmHg, significantly enhanced the BJ reflex effects. A steady-state infusion of veratridine remarkably reduced the slope of the baroreflex function ISP-SAP and ISP-HR curves. The results indicate that the BJ reflex effects are affected by the prevailing arterial baroreceptor input, varying inversely with the ISP level. An attenuation in the baroreflex sinsitivity, in terms of the loop gain or slope of the transfer function curve, was observed during the BJ reflex. The presence of tonic cardiovascular inhibitions exerted by the arterial baroreceptors tends to reduce the BJ reflex bradycardia and hypotension, but the baroreceptors do not function adequately in buffering the cardiovascular inhibition produced by the cardiogenic reflex.",0
10404494,Upper extremity augmentation of lower extremity kinetics during countermovement vertical jumps,"Twenty-five volleyball players (14 males, 11 females) were videotaped (60 Hz) performing countermovement vertical jumps with and without an arm swing. Ground reaction force and video-based coordinate data were collected simultaneously. The resultant joint force and torque at the hip, knee, ankle and shoulder for two trials per subject per condition were computed and normalized. Average kinematic, resultant joint force and torque data were compared using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Larger values were recorded for the vertical velocity of the centre of mass at take-off in the jumps with (mean 2.75, s = 0.3 m.s-1) versus without (mean 2.44, s = 0.23 m.s-1) an arm swing. The jumps with no arm swing produced larger torques at the hip during the first third of the propulsive phase (from zero to maximum vertical velocity of the centre of mass). During the final two-thirds of the propulsive phase, the arm swing augmented hip extensor torques by slowing the rate of trunk extension and placing the hip extensor muscles in slower concentric conditions that favoured the generation of larger forces and resultant joint torques. During the first two-thirds of the propulsive phase, knee extensor torque increased by 28% in the jumps with an arm swing, but maintained a relatively constant magnitude in the jumps with no arm swing.",0
23886926,European regulatory framework and practices for veterinary Leptospira vaccine potency testing,"In Europe, the legal basis for requirements for medicinal products is described in the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) In the European Union, the Ph. Eur. is supplemented by several guidelines issued by the European Medicines Agency. Immunological veterinary products must comply with the Ph. Eur. monograph on veterinary vaccines and the accompanying texts, as well as specific monographs. The Ph. Eur. includes monographs on canine leptospirosis and bovine leptospirosis vaccines (inactivated). Both monographs require that an immunogenicity test be performed once in the target species during the life of a vaccine. The hamster challenge test is applied for batch potency testing of canine vaccines. Alternatively, serological tests or suitable validated in vitro tests to determine the content of one or more antigenic components indicative of protection may be performed. Vaccines for use in cattle are tested in a serological test in guinea pigs. The acceptance criteria in alternative tests are set with reference to a batch of vaccine that has given satisfactory results in the immunogenicity test. At a January 2012 European workshop, the suitability of the hamster potency test was questioned and unanimous agreement was reached that moving toward complete in vitro testing is possible and should be promoted.",0
12824190,Kennedy's disease. Phosphorylation of the polyglutamine-expanded form of androgen receptor regulates its cleavage by caspase-3 and enhances cell death,"X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy is a degenerative disease affecting motor neurons that is caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion within the androgen receptor (AR). The polyQ-expanded form of AR is cytotoxic to cells, and proteolytic cleavage enhances cell death. The intracellular signaling pathways activated and/or required for cell death induced by the expanded form of AR (AR112) are unknown. We found that AR regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathways and, therefore, hypothesized that these pathway(s) may be required for AR112-induced cell death. The polyQ expansion in AR activates three MAP kinase pathways, causing increasing levels of phosphorylation of p44/42, p38, and SAPK/JNK MAP kinase. Inhibitors of either the JNK or p38 pathways had no effect on AR112-induced cell death, suggesting they are not required for polyQ-induced cell death. Strikingly, the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, which selectively inhibits the p44/42 MAP kinase pathway, reduces AR112-stimulated cell death. The inhibition of the MEK1/2 pathway correlates directly with a change in phosphorylation state of the androgen receptor. Mutation of the MAP kinase consensus phosphorylation site in AR at serine 514 blocked AR-induced cell death and the generation of caspase-3-derived cleavage products. We propose a mechanism by which phosphorylation at serine 514 of AR enhances the ability of caspase-3 to cleave AR and generate cytotoxic polyQ fragments.",1

Prevalence of null alleles and predominance of C-->T transition in their genesis,"We studied the molecular bases for C8 beta deficiency in 34 unrelated families from the United States and the former Soviet Union. These families represented 69 unrelated null alleles of which 59 (86%) were found to be due to a previously described C-->T transition in exon 9. Six additional null alleles were also caused by C-->T transitions, of which four (6%) were located at base 388 in exon 3, one (2%) at base 298 in exon 3, and one (2%) involved cytosine 847 in exon 6. All of the null alleles affecting cytosine 388 were linked to the sequence polymorphism at base 376, which determines the uncommon C8 beta acidic allotype. Two null alleles were caused by single base pair deletions of cytosines at positions 430 and 632 in exons 3 and 5, respectively. Of the characterized null alleles, 97% were due to C-->T transitions in which an arginine (64 alleles) or a glutamine (one allele) was replaced by a stop codon. The basis for this apparent high frequency of C-->T transitions occurring in a relatively short stretch of DNA is uncertain.",1

9371821,"Impaired granulopoiesis, myelodysplasia, and early lethality in CCAAT/enhancer binding protein epsilon-deficient mice","Polymorphonuclear leukocytes are essential for host defense to infectious diseases. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein epsilon (C/EBP epsilon) is preferentially expressed in granulocytes and lymphoid cells. Mice with a null mutation in C/EBP epsilon develop normally and are fertile but fail to generate functional neutrophils and eosinophils. Opportunistic infections and tissue destruction lead to death by 3-5 months of age. Furthermore, end-stage mice develop myelodysplasia, characterized by proliferation of atypical granulocytes that efface the bone marrow and result in severe tissue destruction. Thus, C/EBP epsilon is essential for terminal differentiation and functional maturation of committed granulocyte progenitor cells.",1
17611497,A transforming mutation in the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1 in cancer,"Although AKT1 (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1) kinase is a central member of possibly the most frequently activated proliferation and survival pathway in cancer, mutation of AKT1 has not been widely reported. Here we report the identification of a somatic mutation in human breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers that results in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at amino acid 17 (E17K) in the lipid-binding pocket of AKT1. Lys 17 alters the electrostatic interactions of the pocket and forms new hydrogen bonds with a phosphoinositide ligand. This mutation activates AKT1 by means of pathological localization to the plasma membrane, stimulates downstream signalling, transforms cells and induces leukaemia in mice. This mechanism indicates a direct role of AKT1 in human cancer, and adds to the known genetic alterations that promote oncogenesis through the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/AKT pathway. Furthermore, the E17K substitution decreases the sensitivity to an allosteric kinase inhibitor, so this mutation may have important clinical utility for AKT drug development.",1
10220140,Mutations of the human BTK gene coding for bruton tyrosine kinase in X-linked agammaglobulinemia,"X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is an immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the gene coding for Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (BTK). A database (BTKbase) of BTK mutations lists 544 mutation entries from 471 unrelated families showing 341 unique molecular events. In addition to mutations, a number of variants or polymorphisms have been found. Mutations in all the five domains of BTK cause the disease, the single most common event being missense mutations. Most mutations lead to truncation of the enzyme. The mutations appear almost uniformly throughout the molecule. About one-third of point mutations affect CpG sites, which usually code for arginine residues. The putative structural implications of all the missense mutations are provided in the database. BTKbase is available at http://www.uta.fi/imt/bioinfo.",1
16098038,Identification and characterization of a novel retroviral-like aspartic protease specifically expressed in human epidermis,"Proteases play a pivotal role in epidermal differentiation and desquamation. Separation of a total protein extract from human reconstructed epidermis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subsequent peptide analysis of a specific protein spot identified a new protein exhibiting similarities with the retroviral aspartic protease family. Cloning of the corresponding full-length cDNA revealed an open reading frame encoding for a new protease of 343 amino acids, containing a putative aspartic protease catalytic domain. We named this protein Skin ASpartic Protease (SASPase). RT-PCR and northern blot analysis of various human tissues revealed that SASPase was specifically expressed within the epidermis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed a particularly intense expression restricted to the granular layers, whereas in diseased skin, its expression was changed. Western blot analysis, using a monoclonal antibody, revealed the expression of two forms of the enzyme: a 28 kDa putative proform and the active 14 kDa form. Recombinant truncated SASPase (SASP28) was generated from a prokaryotic expression system in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with GST. SASP28 degraded insulin and to a lesser extent casein with a pH optimum of 5. As seen for retroviral proteases, an auto-activation processing was evidenced, generating a 14 kDa protein (SASP14). Site-directed mutagenesis inhibited auto-activation of the enzyme. Indinavir, a potent HIV protease inhibitor used in AIDS therapy, had a significant inhibitory effect on rSASPase auto-activation, which could explain its side effects on skin.",1
11506491,A common founder for the V126D CDKN2A mutation in seven North American melanoma-prone families,"One of the most common melanoma-related CDKN2A mutations reported in North America is the V126D mutation. We examined nine markers surrounding CDKN2A in three American and four Canadian families carrying the V126D mutation. All seven families had a haplotype consistent with a common ancestor/founder for this mutation. In addition, the mutation appears to have originated 34-52 generations ago (1-LOD-unit support interval 13-98 generations).",1
12860708,"Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences of Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys, and Wolbachia species from canine blood in Japan","In the present study, three canine blood samples from Japan, that were suspected to be ehrlichia positive were examined. After sequencing the 16S rRNA genes, each dog was found to be infected either with Ehrlichia canis (Kagoshima 1), Anaplasma platys (Okinawa 1), or Wolbachia sp. (Okinawa 2). Phylogenic analysis was performed on these sequences. The nearly entire 16S rRNA sequence of Kagoshima 1 was found to be most similar to the sequences from Oklahoma and Venezuela E. canis strains (1 base pair difference out of 1,387, 99.9% sequence identity). The 16S rRNA gene sequence of Okinawa 1 showed the closest DNA identity to the French strain of A. platys (1 base deletion out of 1,385 bp, 99.6% sequence identity). The 16S rRNA gene sequence of Okinawa 2 illustrated the closest DNA identity to that of a Wolbachia sp. from Dirofilaria immitis (98.9% sequence similarity). These data imply a low diversity within E. canis strains and within A. platys strains, including those strains reported in this study. This is also the first demonstration of Wolbachia DNA in dog blood, suggesting the involvement of Wolbachia sp. in canine febrile illnesses.",0
28813417,CMTM6 maintains the expression of PD-L1 and regulates anti-tumour immunity,"Cancer cells exploit the expression of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) ligand 1 (PD-L1) to subvert T-cell-mediated immunosurveillance. The success of therapies that disrupt PD-L1-mediated tumour tolerance has highlighted the need to understand the molecular regulation of PD-L1 expression. Here we identify the uncharacterized protein CMTM6 as a critical regulator of PD-L1 in a broad range of cancer cells, by using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen. CMTM6 is a ubiquitously expressed protein that binds PD-L1 and maintains its cell surface expression. CMTM6 is not required for PD-L1 maturation but co-localizes with PD-L1 at the plasma membrane and in recycling endosomes, where it prevents PD-L1 from being targeted for lysosome-mediated degradation. Using a quantitative approach to profile the entire plasma membrane proteome, we find that CMTM6 displays specificity for PD-L1. Notably, CMTM6 depletion decreases PD-L1 without compromising cell surface expression of MHC class I. CMTM6 depletion, via the reduction of PD-L1, significantly alleviates the suppression of tumour-specific T cell activity in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide insights into the biology of PD-L1 regulation, identify a previously unrecognized master regulator of this critical immune checkpoint and highlight a potential therapeutic target to overcome immune evasion by tumour cells.",1
1483114,Partially purified bacteriocin kills malignant cells by apoptosis: programmed cell death,"Bacterial proteins, partially purified bacteriocin (PPB), were investigated for their selective killing of malignant cells. It is shown here that upon PPB-cell interaction DNA fragmentation starts within one hour and peaks at 6 hrs. This process requires an on-going cellular metabolism. It is prevented by both actinomycin D, a DNA dependent RNA synthesis inhibitor, and cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. We show here that the DNA fragmentation is triggered by PPB-cell membrane-receptor interaction which signals the activation of endogenous cellular endonucleases rather than actually penetrating the cell and interacting directly with the DNA, or serving as a nuclease itself. Thus, it is suggested that the cell death initiated by the lethal bacterial proteins, PPB, is a programmed, step-wise cell death involving apoptosis.",0
23582218,Method for assessing the impact of emission gasses on physiology and productivity in biological methanogenesis,"This contribution presents a method for quantification of the impact of emission gasses on the methane production with hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea. The developed method allows a robust quantification of the influence of real gasses on the volumetric productivity of methanogenic cultures by uncoupling physiological and mass transfer effects. This is achieved over reference experiments with pure H2 and CO2, simulating the mass transfer influence of the non-convertible side components by addition of N2 to the reactant stream. Furthermore, this method was used to examine the performance of Methanothermobacter marburgensis on different emission gasses. None of the present side components had a negative effect on the volumetric methane production rate. The presented method showed to be ready to use as a generic tool for feasibility studies and quantification of the physiological impact regarding the use of exhaust gasses as reactant gas for the biological methanogenesis.",0
15753322,"Convergent regulation of skeletal muscle Ca2+ channels by dystrophin, the actin cytoskeleton, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase","The skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel (Ca(V)1.1), which is responsible for initiating muscle contraction, is regulated by phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in a voltage-dependent manner that requires direct physical association between the channel and the kinase mediated through A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). The role of the actin cytoskeleton in channel regulation was investigated in skeletal myocytes cultured from wild-type mice, mdx mice that lack the cytoskeletal linkage protein dystrophin, and a skeletal muscle cell line, 129 CB3. Voltage dependence of channel activation was shifted positively, and potentiation was greatly diminished in mdx myocytes and in 129 CB3 cells treated with the microfilament stabilizer phalloidin. Voltage-dependent potentiation by strong depolarizing prepulses was reduced in mdx myocytes but could be restored by positively shifting the stimulus potentials to compensate for the positive shift in the voltage dependence of gating. Inclusion of PKA in the pipette caused a negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation and restored voltage-dependent potentiation in mdx myocytes. These results show that skeletal muscle Ca2+ channel activity and voltage-dependent potentiation are controlled by PKA and microfilaments in a convergent manner. Regulation of Ca2+ channel activity by hormones and neurotransmitters that use the PKA signal transduction pathway may interact in a critical way with the cytoskeleton and may be impaired by deletion of dystrophin, contributing to abnormal regulation of intracellular calcium concentrations in dystrophic muscle.",0

16722557,Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome (selective vitamin B(12) malabsorption with proteinuria),"Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome (IGS) or selective vitamin B(12) (cobalamin) malabsorption with proteinuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by vitamin B(12) deficiency commonly resulting in megaloblastic anemia, which is responsive to parenteral vitamin B(12) therapy and appears in childhood. Other manifestations include failure to thrive and grow, infections and neurological damage. Mild proteinuria (with no signs of kidney disease) is present in about half of the patients. Anatomical anomalies in the urinary tract were observed in some Norwegian patients. Vitamin B(12) absorption tests show low absorption, not corrected by administration of intrinsic factor. The symptoms appear from 4 months (not immediately after birth as in transcobalamin deficiency) up to several years after birth. The syndrome was first described in Finland and Norway where the prevalence is about 1:200,000. The cause is a defect in the receptor of the vitamin B(12)-intrinsic factor complex of the ileal enterocyte. In most cases, the molecular basis of the selective malabsorption and proteinuria involves a mutation in one of two genes, cubilin (CUBN) on chromosome 10 or amnionless (AMN) on chromosome 14. Both proteins are components of the intestinal receptor for the vitamin B(12)-intrinsic factor complex and the receptor mediating the tubular reabsorption of protein from the primary urine. Management includes life-long vitamin B(12) injections, and with this regimen, the patients stay healthy for decades. However, the proteinuria persists. In diagnosing this disease, it is important to be aware that cobalamin deficiency affects enterocyte function; therefore, all tests suggesting general and cobalamin malabsorption should be repeated after abolishment of the deficiency.",1
27607112,Long-Term Surgical and Speech Outcomes Following Palatoplasty in Patients With Treacher-Collins Syndrome,"BACKGROUND: Cleft palate is present in one-third of patients with Treacher-Collins syndrome. The authors present long-term speech and surgical outcomes of palatoplasty in this challenging patient population. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients with Treacher-Collins syndrome and cleft palate was conducted over a 35-year period at a single institution. Demographics, palatal, mandibular, airway, and surgical outcomes were recorded. Speech outcomes were assessed by the same craniofacial speech pathologist. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients with Treacher-Collins syndrome were identified: 43% (25) had a cleft palate and 16% (9) underwent palatoplasty at our institution. Cleft palate types included 1 Veau I, 5 Veau II, 1 Veau III, and 2 Veau IV. Mean age at the time of palatoplasty was 2.0 years (range, 1.0-6.7 years). Three patients had fistulas (33%) and underwent repairs. Pruzansky classifications included 1 type IIA, 6 type IIB, and 2 type III. Seven patients completed long-term speech evaluations. Mean age at follow-up was 13.9 years (range 2.2-24.3 years). Six patients had articulatory velopharyngeal dysfunction related to Treacher-Collins syndrome. Two patients had structural velopharyngeal dysfunction and required further palatal/pharyngeal surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Cleft palate repair in patients with Treacher-Collins syndrome has a high incidence of velopharyngeal dysfunction. However, the majority of patients are articulatory-based in whom further surgery would not provide benefit. Patients with Treacher-Collins syndrome and cleft palate require close evaluation by a speech pathologist as the incidence of articulatory dysfunction is high.",0
31320604,Effect of Pretransplant Dialysis Modality on Outcomes After Simultaneous Pancreas-Kidney Transplantation,"BACKGROUND Pretransplant dialysis modality may affect outcome after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT), and it has been suspected that peritoneal dialysis (PD) is associated with more postoperative complications compared to hemodialysis (HD). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether pretransplant dialysis modality affects the risk for postoperative complications in SPKT recipients. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a retrospective longitudinal cohort study of all patients undergoing SPKT from 2010 to 2017, during which 99 simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantations were performed. Three pre-emptive transplantations were excluded. Patient groups receiving PD (n=59) or HD (n=37) were similar regarding baseline characteristics. All complications occurring during the first 3 months after transplantation, as well as patient and graft survival, were analyzed. RESULTS There were no significant differences in postoperative complications between groups, with similar rates of intra-abdominal infections (8% in HD vs. 10% in PD), pancreatitis (16% in HD vs. 17% in PD), gastrointestinal bleedings (22% in HD vs. 10% in PD), and relaparotomies (27% in HD vs. 24% in PD). None of the patients had venous graft thrombosis. Past peritonitis was not associated with increased risk for postoperative complications in PD patients. Patient and graft survival were similar between PD and HD groups. CONCLUSIONS Peritoneal dialysis is not a risk factor for postoperative complications after SPKT.",0
8855281,The human AQP4 gene: definition of the locus encoding two water channel polypeptides in brain,"The aquaporin family of membrane water transport proteins are expressed in diverse tissues, and in brain the predominant water channel protein is AQP4. Here we report the isolation and characterization of the human AQP4 cDNAs and genomic DNA. Two cDNAs were isolated corresponding to the two initiating methionines (M1 in a 323-aa polypeptide and M23 in a 301-aa polypeptide) previously identified in rat [Jung, J.S., Bhat, R.V., Preston, G.M., Guggino, W.B. & Agre, P. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 13052-13056]. Similar to other aquaporins, the AQP4 gene is composed of four exons encoding 127, 55, 27, and 92 amino acids separated by introns of 0.8, 0.3, and 5.2 kb. Unlike other aquaporins, an alternative coding initiation sequence (designated exon 0) was located 2.7 kb upstream of exon 1. When spliced together, M1 and the subsequent 10 amino acids are encoded by exon 0; the next 11 amino acids and M23 are encoded by exon 1. Transcription initiation sites have been mapped in the proximal promoters of exons 0 and 1. RNase protection revealed distinct transcripts corresponding to M1 and M23 mRNAs, and AQP4 immunoblots of cerebellum demonstrated reactive polypeptides of 31 and 34 kDa. Using a P1 and a lambda EMBL subclone, the chromosomal site of the human AQP4 gene was mapped to chromosome 18 at the junction of q11.2 and q12.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. These studies may now permit molecular characterization of AQP4 during human development and in clinical disorders.",1
27925076,Experience and coping strategies in relatives of addicts,"Objective:: to understand the experience and coping strategies in relatives of drug addicts. Method:: a study was developed with 87 relatives of addicts, registered in two Basic Health Units. The focus group was used as the study method, and content analysis was applied. Results:: four categories were chosen: perception of relatives about the drug addiction of their family members; feelings and attitudes related to being a relative of an addict; difficulties found in the process; and, coping strategies. The findings reflected the difficulty when mentioning the subject, and the need of being cared for. Relatives believed that the addict needs to have the will to get into treatment, and they faced challenges in dealing with sporadic disappearances. They pointed to feelings of pity, impotence, disgust, hate, shame, fear of aggressiveness, and humiliation. Conclusion: : the biggest difficulties were dealing with relapses, and the lack of public resources. Religiosity and faith, isolation and advice were used as coping strategies; ambivalence in thoughts and attitudes was demonstrated.",0

21954287,Phenotypic spectrum associated with CASK loss-of-function mutations,"BACKGROUND: Heterozygous mutations in the CASK gene in Xp11.4 have been shown to be associated with a distinct brain malformation phenotype in females, including disproportionate pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia. METHODS: The study characterised the CASK alteration in 20 new female patients by molecular karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridisation, sequencing, reverse transcriptase (RT) and/or quantitative real-time PCR. Clinical and brain imaging data of a total of 25 patients were reviewed. RESULTS: 11 submicroscopic copy number alterations, including nine deletions of ~11 kb to 4.5 Mb and two duplications, all covering (part of) CASK, four splice, four nonsense, and one 1 bp deletion are reported. These heterozygous CASK mutations most likely lead to a null allele. Brain imaging consistently showed diffuse brainstem and cerebellar hypoplasia with a dilated fourth ventricle, but of remarkably varying degrees. Analysis of 20 patients in this study, and five previously reported patients, revealed a core clinical phenotype comprising severe developmental delay/intellectual disability, severe postnatal microcephaly, often associated with growth retardation, (axial) hypotonia with or without hypertonia of extremities, optic nerve hypoplasia, and/or other eye abnormalities. A recognisable facial phenotype emerged, including prominent and broad nasal bridge and tip, small or short nose, long philtrum, small chin, and/or large ears. CONCLUSIONS: These findings define the phenotypic spectrum associated with CASK loss-of-function mutations. The combination of developmental and brain imaging features together with mild facial dysmorphism is highly suggestive of this disorder and should prompt subsequent testing of the CASK gene.",1
3293923,"Molecular aspects, physiological function, and clinical significance of metallothioneins","Metallothioneins (MTs) are well-characterized low molecular weight, heat-stable cytosolic proteins with exceptional high content of cysteinyl sulfur and are known to bind heavy metals like cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu). Since these proteins are induced on exposure to heavy metals, it is now accepted that they have a detoxifying role during heavy metal toxicity. It has also been suggested that the primary function of Mt is in the homeostasis of the essential metals Zn and Cu. Recently, a role MT in selenium metabolism in primates has been established. Further, MT has gained considerable importance in the clinical disorders related to trace metal metabolism.",0

28444898,An Isoquinolin-1(2H)-Imine Derivative Induces Cell Death via Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species and Activation of JNK in Human A549 Cancer Cells,"Compound 11-benzoyl-10-chloro-7,9-difluoro-6-imino-2,3,4,6-tetrahydro-1H-pyrimido[1,2-b]isoquinoline-8-carbonitrile (HC6h) is a novel polyhalo 1,3-diazaheterocycle fused isoquinolin-1(2H)-imines derivative, which displays good anticancer activity and low toxicity in vivo. However, the underlying anticancer mechanisms have not previously been identified. The proliferation of A549 was assessed by MTT assay. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was assessed in A549 with a H2 DCFDA probe. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using the JC-1 staining. Apoptosis were measured by annexin-V/PI assay and autophagy by acridine orange staining and GFP-LC3 fluorescence assay. The expression of autophagic and apoptotic proteins was determined by Western blot. The compound HC6h increased accumulation of vesicles, acridine orange-stained cells and LC3-II in A549 cells. Inhibition of compound HC6h-induced autophagy by bafilomycin A1 increased apoptosis. Compound HC6h enhanced activation of caspase-3, caspase-9 and PARP cleavage in A549 cells. Compound HC6h leads to the rapid generation of intracellular ROS. Moreover, compound HC6h induced phosphorylation of JNK and was conferred by the increased ROS levels. Furthermore, down-regulation of JNK attenuated autophagic and apoptotic effect in response to HC6h. The induction of ROS upon HC6h treatment leads to the activation of JNK that mediates autophagy and apoptosis in human A549 cancer cells. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 4394-4403, 2017.

20174756,The direct thrombin inhibitor argatroban effectively prevents cardiac catheter thrombosis in vitro,"The direct thrombin inhibitor argatroban offers some significant advantages over unfractionated heparin (UFH) and is recommended as an alternative anticoagulant during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The impact of argatroban on cardiac catheter thrombosis--a severe potential complication of PCI--has not been systematically studied yet. The aim of the present study was to test in vitro the hypothesis that argatroban is equivalent to the more established anticoagulants UFH and enoxaparin in preventing catheter thrombus formation. Blood pretreated with the anticoagulants of interest was continuously circulated through a guiding catheter by using a roller pump for a maximum experimental period of 60 minutes. In an alternate model, coagulation was mechanically induced by a magnetic stirrer. Coagulation parameters, overall thrombus weight and electron microscopic features (deposits of platelets and fibrin on the catheter surface) were quantified as endpoints. Argatroban (administered as bolus or continuous infusion), UFH (bolus), and enoxaparin (bolus) significantly reduced catheter thrombus formation compared to untreated controls. Here, neither overall thrombus weight nor platelet/fibrin deposition was different among the specific anticoagulants. Declining ACT (activated clotting time) levels--which were found in the argatroban bolus group--could be prevented by continuous infusion. In magnetic stirrer-induced coagulation, thrombus weight was lower following bolus treatment with UFH and enoxaparin compared to argatroban. These data suggest that the potential for argatroban in preventing catheter thrombosis is comparable to that of UFH and enoxaparin. However, the anticoagulatory efficacy varied, depending on the model of coagulation activation, which demonstrates the necessity for specific testing.",0
14564756,Corneal hypoxia secondary to contact lenses: the effect of high-Dk lenses,"Contact lenses made from materials of low-oxygen permeability (Dk) do not meet the oxygen requirements of the cornea for overnight wear. Long-term extended wear of these lenses results in chronic changes to all layers of the cornea, many of which are associated with hypoxia. High-Dk silicone hydrogel and gas permeable lenses are now available for 30-night continuous wear. The high-oxygen transmissibilities of these lenses have enabled the development of a successful continuous wear modality by eliminating the hypoxic effects of long-term wear. Presently, the focus is on improving lens performance by developing lenses that are more biocompatible, provide greater comfort, and maintain a stable tear film without inflammatory or mechanically induced adverse events.",0
26186032,Stressful life events and incident metabolic syndrome: the Hoorn study,"Stressful life events are associated with the metabolic syndrome in cross-sectional studies, but prospective studies addressing this issue are rare and limited. We therefore evaluated whether the number of stressful life events is associated with incident metabolic syndrome. We assessed the association between the number of stressful life events experienced in the 5 years up until baseline and incident metabolic syndrome after 6.5 years at follow-up in the Hoorn study, a middle-aged and elderly population-based cohort. Participants with prevalent metabolic syndrome at baseline were excluded. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III, including fasting plasma glucose levels, HDL-C levels, triglyceride levels, waist circumference and hypertension. We included 1099 participants (47% male; age 60 +/- 7 years). During 6.5 years of follow-up, 238 participants (22%) developed the metabolic syndrome. Logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, education level and follow-up duration showed a positive association between the number of stressful life events at baseline and incident metabolic syndrome [OR 1.13 (1.01-1.27) per event, p = 0.049]. In addition, a Poisson model showed a significant positive association between the number of stressful life events at baseline and the number of metabolic syndrome factors at follow-up [OR 1.05 (1.01-1.11) per event, p = 0.018]. Finally, we observed a significant association between the number of stressful life events at baseline and waist circumference at follow-up [adjusted for confounders beta 0.86 (0.39-1.34) cm per event, p < 0.001]. Overall, we concluded that persons who reported more stressful life events at baseline had a significantly increased risk for developing metabolic syndrome during 6.5 years of follow-up, in a middle-aged and elderly population-based cohort.

31673841,Vision-related quality of life in Japanese patients with wet age-related macular degeneration treated with intravitreal aflibercept in a real-world setting,"PURPOSE: To evaluate vision-related quality of life (QoL) in wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) patients receiving intravitreal aflibercept (IVT-AFL). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational Japanese postmarketing surveillance study. METHODS: All decisions were made by the treating physician. QoL was assessed using the 25-item National Eye Institute-Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) composite score administered at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months (primary assessment). Secondary assessments included NEI-VFQ-25 subscale scores, resource use, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA; logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR]). RESULTS: In total, 576 patients (baseline), 555 patients (6 months), and 446 patients (12 months) were included. The mean (SD) number of IVT-AFL injections was 3.5 (1.2) at 6 months and 4.6 (2.2) at 12 months. The mean (SD) improvement from baseline in the NEI-VFQ-25 composite score was 3.1 (11.1) at 6 months and 2.7 (12.3) at 12 months (P < .0001). For the NEI-VFQ-25 subscale scores, the mean change was >/= 4 (minimally important difference) for general vision, near vision, and mental health at 6 months, and for general vision and mental health at 12 months (all P < .0001). A significant improvement from baseline was found in mean BCVA (logMAR) at 6 months (-0.1) and 12 months (-0.1) (P < .0001). The mean change from baseline in the NEI-VFQ-25 scores was greatest in patients with improved BCVA (gain of </= -0.3 logMAR units or >/= 15 letters) after treatment. CONCLUSION: IVT-AFL was associated with significant improvements in QoL and visual acuity in Japanese patients with wAMD in a real-world setting.",0
23661867,Botanical pharmacognosy of stem of Gmelina asiatica Linn,"Gmelina asiatica Linn (G. parvifolia Roxb.) is a large shrub or a small tree. Roots and aerial parts are used in Ayurvedic medicine and also have ethno-medical uses. Root is reported as adulterant to G. arborea roxb roots. Pharmacognostical characters of root were reported. Owing to the shortage of genuine drug and ever-increasing demands in market, it becomes necessary to search an alternative with equal efficacy without compromising the therapeutic value. Nowadays, it becomes a common practice of using stem. In case of roots phytochemical and pharmacological analysis of stem was reported. However, there is no report on the pharmacognostical characters of stem and to differentiate it from roots. The present report describes the botanical pharmacognostical characters of stem and a note to differentiate it from root. Hollow pith, faint annual rings in cut ends, alternatively arranged macrosclereids and bundle cap fibers, and presence of abundant starch grains and calcium oxalates in pith and in ray cells are the diagnostic microscopic characters of stem. Stem pieces can be differentiated from roots by absence of tylosis.",0
17850630,Distribution and frequencies of CDH23 mutations in Japanese patients with non-syndromic hearing loss,"Mutations in the CDH23 gene are known to be responsible for both Usher syndrome type ID (USH1D) and non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB12), and the molecular confirmation of the CDH23 gene has become important in the diagnosis of these conditions. The present study was performed to find whether the CDH23 mutations are also responsible for non-syndromic hearing loss in patients in the Japanese population. A total of 51 sequence variants were found in 64 Japanese probands with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment from autosomal recessive families. Among them, at least four missense mutations in six patients from five families were confirmed to be responsible for deafness by segregation study. All mutations detected were missense mutations, corroborating the previous reports regarding DFNB12. The present data confirmed that CDH23 mutations are frequently found and significantly responsible in Japanese. Interestingly, the CDH23 mutation spectrum in Japanese is very different from that found in Caucasians. This Japanese spectrum may be representative of those in Eastern Asian populations and its elucidation is expected to facilitate the molecular diagnosis of DFNB12 and USH1D.",1
2444626,Monoclonal antibody-induced inhibition of relapsing EAE in SJL/J mice correlates with inhibition of neuroantigen-specific cell-mediated immune responses,"Relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (R-EAE) in SJL/J mice was examined in relation to the development of neuroantigen-specific T cell proliferative (Tprlf) and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses. R-EAE was induced by injecting syngeneic mouse spinal cord homogenate in CFA on days 0 and 7 over the shaved flanks of female SJL/J mice. Mice primed in this manner exhibited significant Tprlf and DTH responses specific for both major myelin proteins, myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP). A time course comparison between the induction of R-EAE and the development of neuroantigen-specific cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses (Tprlf and DTH) revealed that the MBP- and PLP-specific Tprlf and DTH responses peaked prior to the onset of initial clinical symptoms and the DTH responses remained at significant levels throughout the relapsing course of the disease. Monoclonal antibodies were used to determine whether in vivo inhibition of class II-restricted Tprlf and DTH responses correlated with inhibition of R-EAE. In vivo administration of a total of 100 micrograms anti-L3T4 antibody, but not anti-Lyt-2 antibody, resulted in delayed onset and reduced severity of clinical signs of R-EAE concomitant with significantly reduced levels of MBP- and PLP-specific Tprlf and DTH responses. Treatment with a total of 300 micrograms of purified anti-L3T4 resulted in total abrogation of R-EAE induction and neuroantigen-specific CMI. Thus, clinical signs of R-EAE were found to correlate with the activity of neuroantigen-specific, class II-restricted T cells.",0
1569163,A single amino acid substitution (Met786----Val) in the steroid-binding domain of human androgen receptor leads to complete androgen insensitivity syndrome,"Androgen receptors (ARs) in two Japanese siblings with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome were characterized, and their molecular bases were investigated. Androgen binding was undetectable in cultured pubic skin fibroblasts from the patients by whole cell assay. Sequence analysis of exons B-H, which encode the DNA- and steroid-binding domains, of the AR gene from these patients using polymerase chain reaction revealed a single nucleotide substitution in exon F, resulting in an amino acid change at 786 from methionine (ATG) to valine (GTG) within the steroid-binding domain of AR. Reconstruction of this mutation by site-directed mutagenesis into human AR cDNA followed by expression in COS-1 cells led to production of the same amount and the same molecular mass of immunodetectable AR protein as those found with expression of the normal human AR cDNA. However, in contrast to wild-type AR expressed in COS-1 cells, the mutant AR showed markedly low affinity of androgen binding by whole cell assay. These results suggest that androgen resistance in these patients is due to the point mutation in the steroid-binding domain of the AR.",1
1388654,The origin and function of tumor-associated macrophages,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) have a complex relationship with the neoplastic cells of the tumor. On the one hand, the two cell types produce reciprocal growth factors and may be considered to have a symbiotic relationship. On the other hand, TAM can be activated to inhibit tumor growth and destroy neoplastic cells. Here, Alberto Mantovani and colleagues describe this delicate balance and the prospects for its therapeutic manipulation.",1
6739285,Studies on the helminth parasites of sheep in Southern Greenland,"The nematode population of sheep on Greenland is dominated by Ostertagia circumcincta and three Nematodirus species: N. spathiger, N. helvetianus and N. abnormalis. These results are compared with those for other Nordic countries. Great similarities exist with subarctic Norway but there is a lesser degree of correlation with Iceland and lowland Norway which tend to have a richer spectrum of species. N. helvetianus and N. abnormalis, however, have not been reported from sheep in these countries. The abomasal worm population was remarkable in that it contained specimens with an abomally large body size. The epidemiology of infection followed the pattern recognized throughout Europe with an early-season periparturient rise in the faecal egg-count of the ewe being followed by increasing levels of infection in lambs in late summer. The epidemiology of Nematodirus infections was quite distinct from that seen in most of Europe. Species differences and the cool summer climate were thought to account for this disparity and a hypothesis was advanced to explain the observed pattern of events. Levels of infection were apparently similar in undergrazed and fully-utilized grazing areas. Dosing ewes during the winter (between November to March) eliminated the periparturient egg rise. Lambs could be kept almost worm free by keeping them on clean rangeland and dosing at 3-5 week intervals. A clear weight-gain advantage over conventionally reared lambs was only recorded in one year of the study.",0
9226183,Pyridoxine refractory X-linked sideroblastic anemia caused by a point mutation in the erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase gene,"To elucidate how pyridoxine-refractory X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) develops, we analyzed the erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS-E) gene of a patient with the anemia. The activity and amount of the enzyme in bone marrow cells of the patient were found to be approximately 5% of the normal control. We identified a point mutation, which introduces an amino acid substitution from Asp 190 to Val. In transient transfection analyses using quail fibroblasts, accumulation of aberrantly processed proteins, the sizes of which were larger than that of mature ALAS-E, was found in mitochondria. The proteins were reproducibly detected in assays combining in vitro transcription/translation of ALAS-E precursor and import of the precursor into isolated mouse mitochondria. These results suggest that the mutation causing pyridoxine-refractory XLSA affects the processing of the ALAS-E precursor, thus provoking instability of the ALAS-E protein.",1
344298,"The comparative synergistic activity of amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin and azlocillin, mezlocillin, carbenicillin and ticarcillin against Serratia marcescens","The synergistic activities of netilmicin, gentamicin and amikacin combined with carbenicillin, ticarcillin, azlocillin and mezlocillin were investigated against 32 Serratia marcescens isolates. Synergy could be demonstrated by killing curve technique, isobologram plots as susceptibility data with any of the aminoglycosides and penicillins combinations. No antagonism was shown with any of the combinations. The majority of the isolates were resistant to the aminoglycosides and penicillins. Combination of either ureido-penicillin or carbenicillin with gentamicin or netilmicin did not reduce the MIC values to levels achievable in serum but did reduce the MIC levels of both agents to those achievable in urine. The combination of ureido-penicillins or carbenicillin and ticarcillin with amikacin reduced the inhibitory levels of all isolates to levels achievable in both serum and urine.",0
32142093,Micro-CT analysis of the internal acoustic meatus angles as a method of sex estimation in skeletal remains,"The aim of the present study was to verify the lateral angle method for sex estimation by using computed micro-tomography. Two measurements of the anterior lateral angle of the internal acoustic meatus were assessed. The performed analysis revealed that the mean angle at the level of transverse crest of the fundus of the internal acoustic meatus in adults is significantly greater in females (45.58 degrees  vs. 39.68 degrees ; p < 0.05). A 45 degrees  sectioning point was applied, and sex allocation using this measurement was correct in 81.81% of adult samples. In turn, when utilizing the measurement at the level of modiolus of the cochlea, we did not obtain a satisfactory result in sex classification (59.09%). In subadults (male and female samples), the anterior lateral angles were undifferentiated. Thus, the conducted micro-CT analysis shows that the anterior lateral angle measurement method can be used as a preliminary indication of sex in adult individuals.",0
14506131,Genetic background regulates beta-amyloid precursor protein processing and beta-amyloid deposition in the mouse,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multigenic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by distinct neuropathological hallmarks including deposits of the beta-amyloid (A beta) peptide. A beta is a 39- to 43-amino acid peptide derived from the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). While increasing evidence suggests that altered APP processing and A beta metabolism is a common feature of AD, the relationship between the levels of A beta and various APP products and the onset of AD remains unclear. We have undertaken a screen to characterize genetic factors that modify APP processing, A beta metabolism and A beta deposition in a genomic-based yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) transgenic mouse model of AD. A mutant human APP YAC transgene was transferred to three inbred mouse strains. Despite similar levels of holo-APP expression in the congenic strains, the levels of APP C-terminal fragments as well as brain and plasma A beta in young animals varied by genetic background. Furthermore, we demonstrate that age-dependent A beta deposition in the APP YAC transgenic model is dramatically altered depending on the congenic strain examined. These studies demonstrate that APP processing, A beta metabolism and A beta deposition are regulated by genetic background and that analysis of these phenotypes in mice should provide new insights into the factors that regulate AD pathogenesis.",1
2878080,"6,7-Dichloro-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline . A structurally novel beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent","Replacement of the catecholic hydroxyl groups of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist 6,7-dihydroxy-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (trimetoquinol) with chloro substituents results in a compound with marked beta-adrenoceptor antagonist properties. This, therefore, parallels the similar transformation of the beta-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol into the antagonist dichloroisoproterenol. In a test for inhibition of isoproterenol-induced enhancement of the rate of contraction of spontaneously beating guinea pig atrial pairs the resultant 6,7-dichloro-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (6b) had a KB value of (6.7 +/- 2.3) X 10(-8) M. Although this is nearly 2 orders of magnitude less potent than propranolol (KB = 6.2 X 10(-10) M in this test), this compound represents the prototype of a new class of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, and unlike dichloroisoproterenol it is not a partial agonist. It has physicochemical properties, e.g., pKa and distribution and partition coefficients, that differ from the prototypic beta-blockers. These altered properties might impart advantageous tissue distribution and altered pharmacological properties to the new molecule. This new beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist is suggested to merit further study.",0
21455396,Cardiovascular response to ect is unaffected by extent of motor seizure modification,"Effect of the extent of motor seizure modification on cardiovascular responses in ECT was studied at the second ECT session in 50 (ULECT=25) consenting patients. Twenty five patients each received either 0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg of succinylcholine in a random design. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded on five occasions during the ECT session. Extent of motor seizure was assessed on a five point scale by two raters blind to succinylcholine dose. Two raters had good interrater agreement on the scale. Significantly more patients had poor modification with 0.5 mg/kg (68%) than with 1 mg/kg (12%) of succinylcholine. Rate-pressure-product (RPP=systolic BPx Heart rate) significantly changed over the five occasions, maximal being in ictal occasion, but the two succinylcholine dose groups did not differ. Ictal RPP positively correlated with post-anaesthesia RPP, ECT stimulus dose, seizure threshold and both seizure durations (Motor and EEG). Likewise, postictal RPP correlated with seizure threshold and actual ECT stimulus dose. Neither correlated with the motor seizure modification scores. In multiple, stepwise, linear regression models neither ictal nor post-ictal RPP variance was significantly explained by the extent of motor seizure modification scores. Hence, RPP changes during ECT may be reflecting cerebral mechanisms of ECT.",0
9427725,Molecular cloning and characterization of decay-accelerating factor deficiency in Cromer blood group Inab phenotype,"An additional decay-accelerating factor (DAF) mutation, designated as Inab phenotype in the Cromer blood group system, was recently identified in a 28-year-old Japanese woman (H.A.). The red blood cells of H.A., like those of other Inab phenotype individuals, were negative for Cromer system antigens, Cra, Tca, Dra, UMC, and IFC. The deficiency of DAF on the red blood cells of H.A. has been shown by immunoblotting with a murine monoclonal antibody to DAF. Molecular analysis has shown that H.A. is homozygous for a single nucleotide substitution, C1579-->A, at the position 24 bp upstream of the 3'-end of exon 2 of the DAF gene. This substitution causes the activation of a novel cryptic splice site and results in the production of mRNA with a 26 bp deletion. The deletion introduces a reading frame shift and creates a stop codon immediately downstream of the deletion. Translation of mRNA would be terminated at the first amino acid residue of the second short consensus repeat (SCR2) domain (exon 3) of DAF. The functional domains of DAF's complement regulatory activity and the carboxy-terminal signal domains for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring are predicted to be lacking in H.A. Thus, there would be no DAF present on the cell surface.",1

3411651,Assessing multiple trauma: is the cervical spine enough?,"This retrospective study of multiple trauma patients sustaining spinal column fractures was done to assess whether evaluation of the cervical spine alone is adequate. Sixty-three such patients were identified and further descriptive analyses performed. The majority of spinal fractures occurred not in the cervical spine, but in the thoracic and lumbosacral spine areas. Since a number of these spinal fractures have associated neurologic complications, only by prompt evaluation of the entire spinal column can further injuries be prevented. Based on our data, we feel that patients with multiple injuries and an altered sensorium should have the entire spine protected and evaluated radiologically before being cleared.",0
7692321,Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography in the planning of supratentorial glioma surgery,"The utility of gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography in the planning of supratentorial glioma surgery was evaluated. MR angiograms of the arterial and venous anatomy visualized the anatomical relationship of the main arteries to the tumor, especially on three-dimensional images. Combination with data from surface anatomical images allowed the tumor location to be determined preoperatively. Gd-enhanced MR angiography can be used non-invasively prior to tumor surgery to ascertain the spatial relationship of the vessels to the tumor mass.",0
18097414,Toll-like receptor signalling in macrophages links the autophagy pathway to phagocytosis,"Phagocytosis and autophagy are two ancient, highly conserved processes involved, respectively, in the removal of extracellular organisms and the destruction of organisms in the cytosol. Autophagy, for either metabolic regulation or defence, involves the formation of a double membrane called the autophagosome, which then fuses with lysosomes to degrade the contents, a process that has similarities with phagosome maturation. Toll-like-receptor (TLR) engagement activates a variety of defence mechanisms within phagocytes, including facilitation of phagosome maturation, and also engages autophagy. Therefore we speculated that TLR signalling might link these processes to enhance the function of conventional phagosomes. Here we show that a particle that engages TLRs on a murine macrophage while it is phagocytosed triggers the autophagosome marker LC3 to be rapidly recruited to the phagosome in a manner that depends on the autophagy pathway proteins ATG5 and ATG7; this process is preceded by recruitment of beclin 1 and phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase activity. Translocation of beclin 1 and LC3 to the phagosome was not associated with observable double-membrane structures characteristic of conventional autophagosomes, but was associated with phagosome fusion with lysosomes, leading to rapid acidification and enhanced killing of the ingested organism.",1
3032455,Molecular analysis of mbcl-2: structure and expression of the murine gene homologous to the human gene involved in follicular lymphoma,"We have cloned the mouse bcl-2 (mbcl-2) genomic locus and analyzed it in detail. The gene is comprised of two exons separated by more than 15 kb. Two species of mRNAs are produced, and DNA sequencing analysis shows that they code for two proteins differing at their C terminus: a 7.5 kb transcript codes for a polypeptide of 236 amino acids, mbcl-2 alpha, and a 2.4 kb transcript, which derives from the 5' exon only, codes for a protein of 199 amino acids, mbcl-2 beta. The gene is characterized by very long (5' about 1.4 kb, and 3' about 5.1 kb) untranslated regions surrounding the relatively short coding region. We have mapped the 5' end of the mbcl-2 mRNAs by S1 protection analysis, and we have analyzed the promoter region. The expression of the mbcl-2 gene was analyzed in different cell lines and in mouse tissues. Expression is tissue-specific in adult tissues: spleen and thymus express the highest level of mbcl-2 transcripts. The mbcl-2 gene maps to mouse chromosome 1.",1
16240341,Calcitonin gene-related peptide does not excite or sensitize meningeal nociceptors: implications for the pathophysiology of migraine,"Migraine is among the most common types of pain, but its mechanisms are poorly understood. A growing body of evidence points to a critical role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the pathophysiology of migraine headache. During migraine, CGRP is thought to be released from peripheral endings of perivascular meningeal nociceptors primary and to promote vasodilatation. A current hypothesis suggests that peripheral CGRP and its related meningeal vasodilatation results in activation and sensitization, leading to the generation of migraine headache. However, direct evidence supporting this idea is lacking. Here, using electrophysiological, extracellular, single-unit recording combined with laser-Doppler flowmetry measurements of dural blood flow (DBF), we examined whether CGRP and meningeal vasodilatation promote activation or sensitization of meningeal nociceptors. Changes in (DBF), ongoing discharge, and responsiveness to mechanical stimulation of the dura were studied after either topical administration or intravenous infusion of rat alpha-CGRP in anesthetized rats. Both topical and systemic administration of CGRP caused a significant increase in dural blood flow; however, neither method of CGRP administration resulted in activation or sensitization of meningeal nociceptors. The results of this study suggest that CGRP effects in the meninges, including meningeal vasodilatation, are not sufficient to activate or sensitize meningeal nociceptors.",1
8829784,Use of restraint and seclusion in psychiatric settings in New York State,"OBJECTIVE: The authors examined rates of use restraint and seclusion during September 1992 in 125 psychiatric settings in New York State. METHODS: Psychiatric centers and general hospitals with psychiatric services were surveyed by mail about use of restraint and seclusion during a one-month period and about facility characteristics. Four measures of use of restraint and seclusion were calculated: percentage of patients restrained, percentage of patients secluded, rate of seclusion orders, and rate of restraint orders. RESULTS: Use of restraint and seclusion varied dramatically among the psychiatric settings studied. Use of restraint was not related to use of seclusion. Of the 112 tested relationships between facility and patient characteristics and variations in the restraint and seclusion measures, only 12 proved to be significant. None of the variables correlated significantly with variations in more than two of the four measures of restraint or seclusion, and only three correlated with at least two of the four measures. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in use of restraint and seclusion in psychiatric settings in New York State are dramatic and difficult to correlate with differences in the patient populations. The authors suggest that such variations prevail because of the disparate clinical perspectives on the advisability of restraint and seclusion and the limited comparative monitoring of restraint and seclusion practices in psychiatric settings.",0
22694106,Fine-scale genetic analysis of species-specific female preference in Drosophila simulans,"Behavioural differences are thought to be the first components to contribute to species isolation, yet the precise genetic basis of behavioural isolation remains poorly understood. Here, we used a combination of behaviour assays and genetic mapping to provide the first refined map locating candidate genes for interspecific female preference isolating Drosophila simulans from D. melanogaster. First, we tested whether two genes identified as affecting D. melanogaster female intraspecific mate choice also affect interspecific mate choice; neither of these genes was found to contribute to species-specific female preference. Next, we used deficiency mapping to locate genes on the right arm of the third chromosome for species-specific female preference and identified five small significant regions that contain candidate genes contributing to behavioural isolation. All five regions were located in areas that would have low interspecific recombination, which mirrors the results of other behavioural isolation studies that used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, but without the potential concern of bias towards regions of low recombination that QTL mapping may have. As this model system may be refined to the individual gene level using the same methodology, this initial map we provide may potentially serve as a ready template for the identification and characterization of the first behavioural isolation genes.",0
10839545,ATM phosphorylation of Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein is required in a DNA damage response,"Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is characterized by extreme radiation sensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer. The phenotypes are similar to those of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) disease, where there is a deficiency in a protein kinase that is activated by DNA damage, indicating that the Nbs and Atm proteins may participate in common pathways. Here we report that Nbs is specifically phosphorylated in response to gamma-radiation, ultraviolet light and exposure to hydroxyurea. Phosphorylation of Nbs mediated by gamma-radiation, but not that induced by hydroxyurea or ultraviolet light, was markedly reduced in ATM cells. In vivo, Nbs was phosphorylated on many serine residues, of which S343, S397 and S615 were phosphorylated by Atm in vitro. At least two of these sites were underphosphorylated in ATM cells. Inactivation of these serines by mutation partially abrogated Atm-dependent phosphorylation. Reconstituting NBS cells with a mutant form of Nbs that cannot be phosphorylated at selected, ATM-dependent serine residues led to a specific reduction in clonogenic survival after gamma-radiation. Thus, phosphorylation of Nbs by Atm is critical for certain responses of human cells to DNA damage.",1
21664996,Disease-causing mutations in genes of the complement system,"Recent studies have revealed profound developmental consequences of mutations in genes encoding proteins of the lectin pathway of complement activation, a central component of the innate immune system. Apart from impairment of immunity against microorganisms, it is known that hereditary deficiencies of this system predispose one to autoimmune conditions. Polymorphisms in complement genes are linked to, for example, atypical hemolytic uremia and age-dependent macular degeneration. The complement system comprises three convergent pathways of activation: the classical, the alternative, and the lectin pathway. The recently discovered lectin pathway is less studied, but polymorphisms in the plasma pattern-recognition molecule mannan-binding lectin (MBL) are known to impact its level, and polymorphisms in the MBL-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) result in defects of complement activation. Recent studies have described roles outside complement and immunity of another MBL-associated serine protease, MASP-3, in the etiology of 3MC syndrome, an autosomal-recessive disorder involving a spectrum of developmental features, including characteristic facial dysmorphism. Syndrome-causing mutations were identified in MASP1, encoding MASP-3 and two additional proteins, MASP-1 and MAp44. Furthermore, an association was discovered between 3MC syndrome and mutations in COLEC11, encoding CL-K1, another molecule of the lectin pathway. The findings were confirmed in zebrafish, indicating that MASP-3 and CL-K1 underlie an evolutionarily conserved pathway of embryonic development. Along with the discovery of a role of C1q in pruning synapses in mice, these recent advances point toward a broader role of complement in development. Here, we compare the functional immunologic consequences of ",1
32739393,Vulnerability of the skin barrier to mechanical rubbing,"Skin barrier function is the battlefront for preventing permeation of harmful substances and infectious diseases. However, it can be destroyed by mechanical forces, as shown in many studies. Excess rubbing may increase the permeability of the skin to aqueous material. Although the skin barrier plays an important physiological role in humans, the vulnerability of skin to mechanical rubbing is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the effects of rubbing on the skin in vitro; skin damage was quantified by laser-induced fluorescence. Microscopic observation showed that keratinocytes in the stratum corneum sustained traumatic damage, which reduced the barrier function in that region. The permeability of the skin to an aqueous solution increased with rubbing frequency and load, and rubbing markedly reduced the barrier function of the stratum corneum. To understand the mechanisms underlying the skin damage, we developed a simple mathematical model assuming that the skin is a viscoelastic material. We hypothesized that the increased skin permeability was caused by the damage sustained by keratinocytes in the stratum corneum, and that the permeability was proportional to the time-averaged strain. Our theoretical results showed quantitative agreement with the experimental results and illustrated that rubbing and strain relaxation play key roles in rubbing-induced permeation.",0
30318414,Rbfox1 Mediates Cell-type-Specific Splicing in Cortical Interneurons,"Cortical interneurons display a remarkable diversity in their morphology, physiological properties, and connectivity. Elucidating the molecular determinants underlying this heterogeneity is essential for understanding interneuron development and function. We discovered that alternative splicing differentially regulates the integration of somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons into nascent cortical circuits through the cell-type-specific tailoring of mRNAs. Specifically, we identified a role for the activity-dependent splicing regulator Rbfox1 in the development of cortical interneuron-subtype-specific efferent connectivity. Our work demonstrates that Rbfox1 mediates largely non-overlapping alternative splicing programs within two distinct but related classes of interneurons.",0
18087731,Identification of new ANG gene mutations in a large cohort of Italian patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"Angiogenin (ANG) gene, coding for an angiogenic factor up-regulated by hypoxia and expressed in ventral horn motor neurons, is a novel candidate for the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of cortical and spinal motor neurons. Missense mutations in ANG gene have been identified in two ALS populations from Northern Europe and North America, both in familial (FALS) and sporadic (SALS) patients, but they do not seem to be frequent in the Italian population. We performed a mutational screening in a large cohort of 737 Italian ALS patients, including 605 SALS and 132 FALS cases. We identified seven different mutations, five of which are novel, in nine patients (six SALS and three FALS), but not in 515 healthy controls. Three mutations are located in the signal peptide region, three in the coding sequence, and one in the 3' untranslated region. In our ALS population, the observed mutational frequency of ANG gene accounts for about 1.2%, with an overrepresentation of FALS (2.3%) compared to SALS (1%) cases. We also found the previously described I46V substitution in six patients and four controls, suggesting that this mutation may represent a benign variant, at least in the Italian population. Our results provide further evidence of a tight link between angiogenesis and ALS pathogenesis and suggest that mutations in ANG gene are associated with an increased risk to develop ALS.",1
17588946,The human angiotensin II type 1 receptor +1166 A/C polymorphism attenuates microRNA-155 binding,"The adverse effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) are primarily mediated through the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R). A silent polymorphism (+1166 A/C) in the human AT1R gene has been associated with cardiovascular disease, possibly as a result of enhanced AT(1)R activity. Because this polymorphism occurs in the 3'-untranslated region of the human AT1R gene, the biological importance of this mutation has always been questionable. Computer alignment demonstrated that the +1166 A/C polymorphism occurred in a cis-regulatory site, which is recognized by a specific microRNA (miRNA), miR-155. miRNAs are noncoding RNAs that silence gene expression by base-pairing with complementary sequences in the 3'-untranslated region of target RNAs. When the +1166 C-allele is present, base-pairing complementarity is interrupted, and the ability of miR-155 to interact with the cis-regulatory site is decreased. As a result, miR-155 no longer attenuates translation as efficiently as demonstrated by luciferase reporter and Ang II radioreceptor binding assays. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that mature miR-155 is abundantly expressed in the same cell types as the AT1R (e.g. endothelial and vascular smooth muscle). Finally, when human primary vascular smooth muscle cells were transfected with an antisense miR-155 inhibitor, endogenous human AT1R expression and Ang II-induced ERK1/2 activation were significantly increased. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the AT1R and miR-155 are co-expressed and that miR-155 translationally represses the expression of AT1R in vivo. Therefore, our study provides the first feasible biochemical mechanism by which the +1166 A/C polymorphism can lead to increased AT1R densities and possibly cardiovascular disease.",1

A globus pallidus lesion reduced the resting tone and greatly increased rigidity in the contralateral leg. Lesions in the entopeduncular, subthalamic, and accumbens nuclei had no effects on rigidity, although the entopeduncular nucleus lesion reduced resting limb tone. The role of the globus pallidus in rigidity is significant in relation to work in which striatal lesions abolished tremorine-induced rigidity. Some brain regions that receive basal ganglia efferent fibers received a lesion unilaterally. Lesions in the substantia nigra, red nucleus, or pedunculopontine nucleus had no effect on tremorine-induced rigidity. A habenular lesion significantly reduced rigidity in both hind legs. Very pronounced reductions in rigidity occurred after midbrain lesions involving the central periaqueductal grey region and the superior colliculus. The basal ganglia output pathways that may mediate tremorine rigidity are discussed, together with the possibility that the superior colliculus, which has many muscarinic receptors, may be influenced directly by tremorine.",0
6313758,"Identification of a new structural variant of human apolipoprotein E, E2(Lys146 leads to Gln), in a type III hyperlipoproteinemic subject with the E3/2 phenotype","A type III hyperlipoproteinemic subject having the apolipoprotein E (apo E) phenotype E3/2 was identified. From isoelectric focusing experiments in conjunction with cysteamine treatment (a method that measures cysteine content in apo E), the E2 isoform of this subject was determined to have only one cysteine residue, in contrast to all previously studied E2 apoproteins, which had two cysteines. This single cysteine was shown to be at residue 112, the same site at which it occurs in apo E3. From amino acid and sequence analyses, it was determined that this apo E2 differed from apo E3 by the occurrence of glutamine rather than lysine at residue 146. When phospholipid X protein recombinants of the subject's isolated E3 and E2 isoforms were tested for their ability to bind to the human fibroblast apo-B,E receptor, it was found that the E3 bound normally (compared with an apo E3 control) but that the E2 had defective binding (approximately 40% of normal). Although they contained E3 as well as E2, the beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) from this subject were very similar in character to the beta-VLDL from an E2/2 type III hyperlipoproteinemic subject; similar subfractions could be obtained from each subject and were shown to have a similar ability to stimulate cholesteryl ester accumulation in mouse peritoneal macrophages. The new apo E2 variant has also been detected in a second type III hyperlipoproteinemic subject.",1
22307738,Behavioral genetics of affective and anxiety disorders,"As shown by clinical genetic studies, affective and anxiety disorders are complex genetic disorders with genetic and environmental factors interactively determining their respective pathomechanism. Advances in molecular genetic techniques including linkage studies, association studies, and genome-wide association studies allow for the detailed dissection of the genetic influence on the development of these disorders. Besides the molecular genetic investigation of categorical entities according to standardized diagnostic criteria, intermediate phenotypes comprising neurobiological or neuropsychological traits (e.g., neuronal correlates of emotional processing) that are linked to the disease of interest and that are heritable, have been proposed to be closer to the underlying genotype than the overall disease phenotype. These intermediate phenotypes are dimensional and more precisely defined than the categorical disease phenotype, and therefore have attracted much interest in the genetic investigation of affective and anxiety disorders. Given the complex genetic nature of affective and anxiety disorders with an interaction of multiple risk genes and environmental influences, the interplay of genetic factors with environmental factors is investigated by means of gene-environment interaction (GxE) studies. Pharmacogenetic studies aid in the dissection of the genetically influenced heterogeneity of psychotropic drug response and may contribute to the development of a more individualized treatment of affective and anxiety disorders. Finally, there is some evidence for genetic factors potentially shared between affective and anxiety disorders pointing to a possible overlapping phenotype between anxiety disorders and depression.",0
20375010,Claudin association with CD81 defines hepatitis C virus entry,"Viruses initiate infection by attaching to molecules or receptors at the cell surface. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) enters cells via a multistep process involving tetraspanin CD81, scavenger receptor class B member I, and the tight junction proteins Claudin-1 and Occludin. CD81 and scavenger receptor class B member I interact with HCV-encoded glycoproteins, suggesting an initial role in mediating virus attachment. In contrast, there are minimal data supporting Claudin-1 association with HCV particles, raising questions as to its role in the virus internalization process. In the present study we demonstrate a relationship between receptor active Claudins and their association and organization with CD81 at the plasma membrane by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and stoichiometric imaging methodologies. Mutation of residues 32 and 48 in the Claudin-1 first extracellular loop ablates CD81 association and HCV receptor activity. Furthermore, mutation of the same residues in the receptor-inactive Claudin-7 molecule enabled CD81 complex formation and virus entry, demonstrating an essential role for Claudin-CD81 complexes in HCV infection. Importantly, Claudin-1 associated with CD81 at the basolateral membrane of polarized HepG2 cells, whereas tight junction-associated pools of Claudin-1 demonstrated a minimal association with CD81. In summary, we demonstrate an essential role for Claudin-CD81 complexes in HCV infection and their localization at the basolateral surface of polarized hepatoma cells, consistent with virus entry into the liver via the sinusoidal blood and association with basal expressed forms of the receptors.",1
18173746,Mash1 is required for neuroendocrine cell development in the glandular stomach,"In the epithelium of the developing glandular stomach, neuroendocrine cells differentiate from common progenitors, but the mechanism of how these cells are specified remains to be determined. Here, we show that the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) gene, mammalian achaete-scute homologue 1 (Mash1), is highly expressed in the glandular stomach epithelium. In Mash1-null mice, almost all gastric neuroendocrine cells are missing, whereas development of non-neuroendocrine cells is not significantly affected. The bHLH gene Neurogenin3 (Ngn3), which is known to regulate formation of subsets of gastric neuroendocrine cells (gastrin-, glucagon- and somatostatin-producing cells), is expressed normally in the Mash1-null stomach. Thus, Ngn3 alone is not sufficient but Mash1 is additionally required for the differentiation of these neuroendocrine cells. Taken together, these results indicate that formation of gastrin-, glucagon- and somatostatin-producing cells depends on both Mash1 and Ngn3, while that of other neuroendocrine cells depends on Mash1 alone, suggesting that combinations of bHLH genes may contribute to cell type diversity.",1
12939674,Toxoplasmosis in pregnant Sudanese women,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a sero-epidemiological survey of toxoplasmosis in pregnant Sudanese women. METHODS: Four hundred and eighty-seven pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Khartoum and Omdurman, Maternity Hospitals, Sudan during the period June through to December 2000 were counselled for socio-demographic and obstetrical risk factors for toxoplasmosis, and screened for immunoglobin G (IgG) and IgM anti-toxoplasma antibodies using enzyme linked immunoassay. RESULTS: Immunoglobin G anti-toxoplasma antibodies were positive (titre > 11 IU/ml) in 166/487 (34.1%), while 321/487(65.9%) were sero-negative. The sera of 35 women showed very high titres (>100 IU/ml), 5/35 (14.3%) were IgM-positive. The risk factors for IgG anti-toxoplasma seropositivity were; Southern ethnic origin and consumption of raw meat. Thirty (18.1%) out of 166 women who were IgG anti-toxoplasma seropositive gave history of intrauterine fetal death, while 31 (9.7%) out of 321 women who were sero-negative gave history of intrauterine fetal death, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Over 65% Sudanese women screened for anti-toxoplasma IgG antibodies were sero-negative and they were at risk of sero-conversion during pregnancy. Southers and eating raw meat were the risk factors for toxoplasmosis in Sudanese pregnant women.",0
24308634,A base substitution in the donor site of intron 12 of KIT gene is responsible for the dominant white coat colour of blue fox (Alopex lagopus),"The dominant white coat colour of farmed blue fox is inherited as a monogenic autosomal dominant trait and is suggested to be embryonic lethal in the homozygous state. In this study, the transcripts of KIT were identified by RT-PCR for a dominant white fox and a normal blue fox. Sequence analysis showed that the KIT transcript in normal blue fox contained the full-length coding sequence of 2919 bp (GenBank Acc. No KF530833), but in the dominant white individual, a truncated isoform lacking the entire exon 12 specifically co-expressed with the normal transcript. Genomic DNA sequencing revealed that a single nucleotide polymorphism (c.1867+1G>T) in intron 12 appeared only in the dominant white individuals and a 1-bp ins/del polymorphism in the same intron showed in individuals representing two different coat colours. Genotyping results of the SNP with PCR-RFLP in 185 individuals showed all 90 normal blue foxes were homozygous for the G allele, and all dominant white individuals were heterozygous. Due to the truncated protein with a deletion of 35 amino acids and an amino acid replacement (p.Pro623Ala) located in the conserved ATP binding domain, we propose that the mutant receptor had absent tyrosine kinase activity. These findings reveal that the base substitution at the first nucleotide of intron 12 of KIT gene, resulting in skipping of exon 12, is a causative mutation responsible for the dominant white phenotype of blue fox.",0
16319823,Enlarged parietal foramina caused by mutations in the homeobox genes ALX4 and MSX2: from genotype to phenotype,"Heterozygous mutations of the homeobox genes ALX4 and MSX2 cause skull defects termed enlarged parietal foramina (PFM) and cranium bifidum (CB); a single MSX2 mutation has been documented in a unique craniosynostosis (CRS) family. However, the relative mutational contribution of these genes to PFM/CB and CRS is not known and information on genotype-phenotype correlations is incomplete. We analysed ALX4 and MSX2 in 11 new unrelated cases or families with PFM/CB, 181 cases of CRS, and a single family segregating a submicroscopic deletion of 11p11.2, including ALX4. We explored the correlations between skull defect size and age, gene, and mutation type, and reviewed additional phenotypic manifestations. Four PFM cases had mutations in either ALX4 or MSX2; including previous families, we have identified six ALX4 and six MSX2 mutations, accounting for 11/13 familial, but only 1/6 sporadic cases. The deletion family confirms the delineation of a mental retardation locus to within 1.1 Mb region of 11p11.2. Overall, no significant size difference was found between ALX4- and MSX2-related skull defects, but the ALX4 mutation p.R218Q tends to result in persistent CB and is associated with anatomical abnormalities of the posterior fossa. We conclude that PFM caused by mutations in ALX4 and MSX2 have a similar prevalence and are usually clinically indistinguishable. Mutation screening has a high pickup rate in PFM, especially in familial cases, but is not indicated in CRS.",1
24013174,Cyclin A regulates kinetochore microtubules to promote faithful chromosome segregation,"The most conspicuous event in the cell cycle is the alignment of chromosomes in metaphase. Chromosome alignment fosters faithful segregation through the formation of bi-oriented attachments of kinetochores to spindle microtubules. Notably, numerous kinetochore-microtubule (k-MT) attachment errors are present in early mitosis (prometaphase), and the persistence of those errors is the leading cause of chromosome mis-segregation in aneuploid human tumour cells that continually mis-segregate whole chromosomes and display chromosomal instability. How robust error correction is achieved in prometaphase to ensure error-free mitosis remains unknown. Here we show that k-MT attachments in prometaphase cells are considerably less stable than in metaphase cells. The switch to more stable k-MT attachments in metaphase requires the proteasome-dependent destruction of cyclin A in prometaphase. Persistent cyclin A expression prevents k-MT stabilization even in cells with aligned chromosomes. By contrast, k-MTs are prematurely stabilized in cyclin-A-deficient cells. Consequently, cells lacking cyclin A display higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation. Thus, the stability of k-MT attachments increases decisively in a coordinated fashion among all chromosomes as cells transit from prometaphase to metaphase. Cyclin A creates a cellular environment that promotes microtubule detachment from kinetochores in prometaphase to ensure efficient error correction and faithful chromosome segregation. ",1
28881388,Autosomal dominant calpainopathy due to heterozygous CAPN3 C.643_663del21,"INTRODUCTION: A calpain-3 (CAPN3) gene heterozygous deletion (c.643_663del21) was recently linked to autosomal dominant (AD) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. However, the possibility of digenic disease was raised. We describe 3 families with AD calpainopathy carrying this isolated mutation. METHODS: Probands heterozygous for CAPN3 c.643_663del21 were identified by targeted next generation or whole exome sequencing. Clinical findings were collected for probands and families. Calpain-3 muscle Western blots were performed in 3 unrelated individuals. RESULTS: Probands reported variable weakness in their 40s or 50s, with myalgia, back pain, or hyperlordosis. Pelvic girdle muscles were affected with adductor and hamstring sparing. Creatine kinase was normal to 1,800 U/L, independent of weakness severity. Imaging demonstrated lumbar paraspinal muscle atrophy. Electromyographic findings and muscle biopsies were normal to mildly myopathic. Muscle calpain-3 expression was reduced. DISCUSSION: This study provides further evidence for AD calpainopathy associated with CAPN3 c.643_663del21. No pathogenic variants in other genes known to cause myopathy were detected.

12442948,Induction of peripheral mononuclear cell apoptosis in asthmatic patients in remission,"Apoptosis regulates inflammatory cell survival in allergic inflammation, and decreased apoptosis contributes to the chronicity of inflammation. To investigate the mechanisms of onset and remission of mite-sensitive childhood asthma, we evaluated peripheral blood mononuclear cell apoptosis in patients with asthma and in remission. There was a similar percentage of hypodiploid cells in unstimulated mononuclear cell cultures from patients with active asthma (29.5+/-5.0%) and normal individuals (25.9+/-4.9%). In contrast, the percentage increased in patients in remission (44.5+/-3.2%). In Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) antigen-stimulated mononuclear cell, the stimulation index was lower in patients with active asthma (0.95+/-0.06%) than in normal individuals (1.31+/-0.16%). In contrast to active patients, the proportion of hypodiploid cells stimulated with Df in patients with remission was equivalent to that of normal controls. After phytohemaglutinin (PHA) stimulation, the percentage of hypodiploid cells in patients with active asthma (35.1+/-3.2%) was also lower than in normal individuals (48.5+/-4.3%) or patients in remission (49.5+/-5.7%). Apoptosis occurred predominantly in CD8+, but not CD4+, cells in patients in remission. Interleukin IL-2 inhibited apoptosis in Df-activated cells in normal individuals, whereas IL-2 did not inhibit apoptosis in cells from patients in remission as well as with active asthma. The expression of Fas receptors on resting mononuclear cells was similar in the three groups. However, Fas receptor expression in Df-stimulated mononuclear cells was greater in patients with active asthma than in healthy individuals. In patients with remission that was equivalent to healthy controls. The PHA increased Fas expression to a similar degree in the three groups. With regard to Fas ligand, the expression was lower in unstimulated cultured mononuclear cells from patients than in normal individuals. In patients in remission that was comparable to normal individuals. The Df stimulation upregulated the Fas ligand in patients with active asthma, and downregulated it in patients in remission. In conclusion, apoptosis in Df-stimulated mononuclear cells is impaired in patients with active asthma, while spontaneous apoptosis of CD8+ cells in vivo is augmented in patients in remission, and may be involved in the onset and remission of mite-sensitive asthma.",0
19038922,Characterization of human mucin (MUC15) and identification of ovine and caprine orthologs,"The glycoprotein MUC15 (mucin 15) was initially isolated from the bovine milk fat globule membrane. The present work demonstrates the existence of immunologically similar proteins ( approximately 130 kDa) in ovine, caprine, porcine, and buffalo milk samples. Purification and N-terminal amino acid sequencing confirmed the presence of ovine and caprine MUC15 orthologs in milk fat globule membranes. Expression of MUC15 in human milk was demonstrated by immunostaining ( approximately 150 kDa) as well as by mass spectrometry. Screening of a human multiple tissue expression array showed abundant MUC15 gene expression in placenta, salivary gland, thyroid gland, trachea, esophagus, kidney, testis, and the leukemia K-562 cell line. Furthermore, moderate expression was seen in the pancreas, adult and fetal lung, fetal kidney, lymph node, adult and fetal thymus, and parietal lobe. Structural motifs for interactions (epidermal growth factor receptor and Src homology 2 domains) are identified in the intracellular region. Implication of the mucin in signal transduction and the potential physiological function of MUC15 are discussed.",0
910580,Q-fever soluble vaccine effects in Coxiella burneti sensitized humans,A Q-fever soluble vaccine (phase I C. burnetitrichloro-acetic acid extract) was administered in a single dose to 28 persons formerly immunized with the same soluble vaccine one year before and to other 28 persons which had naturally been infected with C. burneti one or two years ago. All these persons were skin-tested with the same but diluted vaccine 48 hrs before vaccination. Mild local and general reactions were found only in the C. burneti previously infected vaccinees (local reactions in 9 cases and general reactions in 6 cases). Serological conversion was obtained in 92.8% (complement fixation test) and in 89.3% (mouse protection test) of the previously immunized individuals and in 96.4% (CF test) of the formerly Q-fever infected persons.,0
15005993,"Finding common ground in the study of child maltreatment, youth violence, and adult domestic violence","For several decades, we have witnessed a surge in public policies aimed at ending child maltreatment, youth violence, and adult domestic violence. Commensurate with this increased interest has been a growing body of research on each issue's etiology, affected population, and the public policy and prevention impacts. Even a cursory review of the literature suggests a number of commonalities across these forms of violence. As such, it seems timely and prudent to craft a research framework that facilitates the identification and dissemination of practice and policy innovations that can address all three concerns. This article articulates an overarching framework to guide researchers in better identifying common avenues of study. After summarizing the commonalities found across the three areas, the authors identify cross-cutting issues that have particular relevance for advancing our understanding of violence and its effects on personal and social interactions.",0
12921356,Effects of medializing calcaneal osteotomy on Achilles tendon lengthening and plantar foot pressures,"Posterior tibial tendon insufficiency, or adult acquired flatfoot deformity, involves collapse of the longitudinal arch of the foot with ensuing changes in the bony architecture of the foot as well. While it is generally accepted that a medializing calcaneal osteotomy (MCO) is a very useful treatment for restoring the fallen arch, questions regarding the effects of this procedure upon plantar foot pressures and Achilles tendon length changes need to be answered. This study focuses on changes in plantar foot pressures and Achilles tendon length as the result of performing a MCO. Fourteen fresh-frozen cadaver legs were used to test the effects of MCO on Achilles tendon length changes 2 cm proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion on the calcaneus. Differential variable reluctance transducers were anchored in ventromedial, dorsomedial, dorsolateral, and ventrolateral positions of the Achilles tendon at the aforementioned level. The effects of the MCO on plantar foot pressures were assessed simultaneously using the Tekscan HR Mat. Axial loading (100 lbs) of each specimen was performed in neutral and dorsiflexion (15 degrees). Data were gathered for Achilles tendon length changes and plantar foot pressures for three trials in both the neutral and dorsiflexed positions. A medializing calcaneal osteotomy (1 cm medial translation) was then performed and testing was repeated in the fashion outlined heretofore. Analysis of the data revealed that there was no significant increase in Achilles tendon length as a result of the MCO. The data also showed that average pressure over the first and second metatarsal regions of the forefoot decreased significantly after MCO. At the same time there was a significant increase in average pressure over the medial and lateral aspect of the heel. These findings suggest that the Achilles tendon aids in inversion of the forefoot without undergoing a significant increase in length change of Achilles tendon fibers in any of the regions tested.",0

51622,Progress in the chemotherapy of hematologic diseases,"Progress in the chemotherapy of Hodgkin's disease and experimental therapeutic, pharmacologic, and clinical studies of the antitumor antibiotic, adriamycin, are presented in this abstract. In patients with disseminated Hodgkin's disease, the combination chemotherapy program (MOPP) produces a significant increase in the complete remission rate. This has been increased to 90% by the addition of low dose bleomycin to the MOPP program. The continuation of MOPP treatment beyond 6 months and to a total of 24 months provides improved results in patients in remission as measured either from time of onset of complete remission or from end of treatment. Finally, the pattern of relapse in patients with Hodgkin's disease provides a rationale basis for the selective use of radiotherapy in patients in complete remission. Adriamycin has a broad spectrum of antitumor activity in man. Its mechanism of action involves intercalation with DNA and inhibition of DNA function. The selective effect against tumors is not understood but may relate to membrane transport. Adriamycin is a highly important new antitumor agent for the treatment, not only of hematologic malignancies, but for a variety of solid tumors as well.",0
23904880,Case reports - common and external carotid artery resection in head and neck cancer patients,"Most head and neck cancer patients are first referred to an E.N.T. specialist thus the need for that surgeon to be the leader of the multidisciplinary team. Oncological surgical interventions need to ensure clear resection margins; this means that whatever anatomic structures are involved in the tumor spread, need to be resected. The carotid artery is a vascular vessel system that provides blood supply for the head and neck region, the most important structure being the brain and its organs. The ligation or the resection of the common carotid artery leads to an abrupt decrease of blood flow towards the brain, which can cause single sided paralysis, decreased cognitive functions, shock and even death. Common or internal carotid arteries ligatures or resections can be performed in patients with malignant tumors of the head and neck. This is a synopsis of 2 successful cases of patients who underwent common and external carotid artery resection. ",0
32933701,Moringa gum and its modified form as a potential green polymer used in biomedical field,"Over the past few decades, natural gums are extensively investigated by the researchers due to their beneficial physicochemical properties. Among them, the polysaccharide exudates obtained from the stem of the plant Moringa oleifera, known as moringa gum, is investigated widely in the food, pharmaceutical, and other areas. The moringa gum is used in the form of dried powder as a pharmaceutical excipient in various formulations. It is also derivatized either by grafting or by other chemical modifications for enhancing its properties. The research on moringa gum and modified moringa gum has diversified in numerous biomedical fields. However, summarization of these progress are not available in the literature. This article gives an overview of the collection, purification, structural elucidation, and modification of moringa gum. Moreover, the present review furnishes complete information on the various aspects of moringa gum and its applications in various industrial and biomedical fields.",0
25692772,The intermolecular NOE is strongly influenced by dynamics,"The intermolecular NOE in NMR spectroscopy is analyzed theoretically via computer simulation. Our test case is the homonuclear NOE between hydrogens in the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate. A coarse-grained model of this system is developed and simulated in a 3 microseconds molecular dynamics run, subsequently used for analysis. Our findings are the following: Spin pair specific dynamics has a strong influence on the spectrum. As a consequence, structural information cannot be read off directly. Instead, different contributions to the signals must be disentangled before one can gain information about structure. We show that the extent of signal distortion through dynamics correlates with the spins' distance to their respective molecular centers of mass. Since we deal with pair distributions of spins, the extracted structure does not represent average distances between two spins but the sum of the influence of surrounding spins. In fact, we find that this influence is long-ranged. Our data explicitly shows that the usual 1/r(6) dependence is replaced by a distance dependence between 1/r(3) and 1/r. However, structural information consists of a spin pair specific short-ranged contribution and a uniform long-ranged contribution. The transition from specific to uniform is sensitive to the behavior of the underlying pair distribution functions. ",0
16485628,Prevention: the key to reducing cardiovascular disease risk in women,"More than 500,000 US women die of cardiovascular disease (CVD) annually, exceeding deaths for cancer, accidents, and diabetes combined. Yet women are largely unaware of this and fear breast cancer more. One way of changing this number is to change the way we approach CVD, that is, to practice preventive healthcare. Until recently, guidelines for women with CVD were derived largely from research conducted primarily on white middle-aged men. Although evidence-based medicine is still lacking, guidelines and recommendations specifically for women are now available and include aggressive management of the risk factors of smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Unless women are educated regarding these risk factors and are enabled to make lifestyle changes, their chances of modifying and reducing their risks are severely impaired.",0
7180842,Structural mutation in a major human aldehyde dehydrogenase gene results in loss of enzyme activity,"Most Caucasians have two major liver aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes, ALDH1 and ALDH2, while approximately 50% of Orientals have only ALDH1 isozyme, missing the ALDH2 isozyme. A remarkably higher frequency of acute alcohol intoxication among Orientals than among Caucasians could be related to the absence of the ALDH2 isozyme, which has a low apparent Km for acetaldehyde. Examination of liver extracts by two-dimensional crossed immunoelectrophoresis revealed that an atypical Japanese liver, which had no ALDH2 isozyme, contained an enzymatically inactive but immunologically cross-reactive material corresponding to ALDH2, beside the active ALDH1 isozyme. Therefore, the absence of ALDH2 isozyme in atypical Orientals is not due to regulatory mutation, gene deletion, or nonsense mutation, but must be due to a structural mutation in a gene for the ALDH2 locus, resulting in synthesis of enzymatically inactive abnormal protein.",1
21511064,Assessment of repolarization heterogeneity for prediction of mortality in cardiovascular disease: peak to the end of the T wave interval and nondipolar repolarization components,"BACKGROUND: In the canine wedge preparation, the interval from the peak to the end of the T wave (TpTe) reflects transwedge heterogeneities. Increase of ventricular dispersion of action potential durations has been repeatedly shown to be arrhythmogenic; thus, prolonged TpTe intervals were assumed to reflect increased risk. However, despite attempted extrapolation to clinical electrocardiograms, the appropriateness of this assumption has not been investigated in a large population. In another animal model, nondipolar components of the descending T-wave limb (TWRd) have been shown to correlate with TpTe interval. Although total T-wave nondipolar components (TWRt), believed to reflect heterogeneities during total repolarization, were shown associated with worse outcome of cardiac patients, this has not been investigated for TWRd. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male cardiovascular patients (n = 813) had digital 12-lead electrocardiograms recorded between 1984 and 1991 and were followed until 2000. Using commercial and previously validated technology, QT intervals, TpTe intervals, TWRd, and TWRt were calculated, heart rate corrected, and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Their predictive power was also compared with established markers of mortality risk. In contrast to former reports, TpTe(c) intervals were significantly shorter in nonsurvivors (98.76 +/- 20.63 milliseconds vs 103.14 +/- 20.87 milliseconds, P = .016) and not predictive of outcome. Although TWRd(c) was significantly higher in nonsurvivors (0.007% +/- 0.02% vs 0.005% +/- 0.08%, P = .03), it was also not predictive of outcome. Only increased TWRt(c), increased heart rate, and increased age were predictive of death. CONCLUSIONS: The findings challenge the concept that prolongation of TpTe corresponds to higher risk of death from any cause in every population. Further investigations are needed to confirm that clinically measured TpTe reflects transmural repolarization heterogeneity in all clinical populations and indeed is a useful risk marker.",0
12773388,HBXIP functions as a cofactor of survivin in apoptosis suppression,"Survivin is an anti-apoptotic protein that is overexpressed in most human cancers. We show that survivin forms complexes with a cellular protein, hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP), which was originally recognized for its association with the X protein of hepatitis B virus (HBX). Survivin-HBXIP complexes, but neither survivin nor HBXIP individually, bind pro-caspase-9, preventing its recruitment to Apaf1, and thereby selectively suppressing apoptosis initiated via the mitochondria/cytochrome c pathway. Viral HBX protein also interacts with the survivin- HBXIP complex and suppresses caspase activation in a survivin-dependent manner. Thus, HBXIP functions as a cofactor for survivin, and serves as a link between the cellular apoptosis machinery and a viral pathogen involved in hepatocellular carcinogenesis.",1
9240454,The genomic organization of the genes for human lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI) is highly conserved,"We have determined the exon/intron organization of the human lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI) genes. The LBP gene spans approximately 28.5 kb and is composed of 14 exons while the 31.5-kb-long BPI gene is composed of 15 exons. Comparison of the genomic organization of the LBP and BPI genes together with the genomic structures of the PLTP (phospholipid transfer protein) and CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) genes, which all together constitute a gene family of functionally related proteins, revealed high homology with a remarkable conservation of exon/intron transitions. The exon/intron junctions of the LBP, BPI, and PLTP genes are almost identical, with most of the exons being of the same size. In addition, functional domains are conserved in these proteins. The C-terminal octapeptide important for CETP anchoring in lipoprotein particles is also present in LBP, BPI, and PLTP. The LPS binding motif in exons 3 and 4 has been retained in LBP and BPI. Our results indicate that the LBP, BPI, and PLTP genes, and probably the CETP gene, may have evolved from a common primordial gene and may share similar functional properties.",1
10995579,"Characterization, chromosomal localization, and expression during hematopoietic differentiation of the gene encoding Arl6ip, ADP-ribosylation-like factor-6 interacting protein (ARL6)","Proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors are regulated by signals from the microenvironment, involving both secreted cytokines and adhesion molecules. The exact mechanisms by which cytokines act on hematopoietic development are still not well understood. To extend the molecular characterization of gene regulation during cytokine-induced hematopoiesis, we applied mRNA differential display to identify genes regulated when multipotent progenitor cells are allowed to differentiate into monocytes and neutrophils. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a gene that is downregulated during myeloid differentiation and encodes a 23-kDa protein with four putative transmembrane segments. The gene, which we named Arl6ip, is identical to a mouse gene recently identified by its physical interaction with ADP-ribosylation-like factor-6 (ARL6), belonging to the Ras superfamily. We add information on its full-length characterization as well as its regulation during hematopoiesis. It is expressed in all hematopoietic cell lineages, but the highest level of expression is found in early myeloid progenitor cells. Preliminary studies by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the ARL6IP protein is predominantly localized to intracytoplasmic membranes. This suggests an involvement of the Arl6ip gene in protein transport, membrane trafficking, or cell signaling during hematopoietic maturation.",1
24721231,Species-level assessment of the molecular basis of fluoroquinolone resistance among viridans group streptococci causing bacteraemia in cancer patients,"Viridans group streptococci (VGS) are a major cause of bacteraemia in neutropenic cancer patients, particularly those receiving fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. In this study, we sought to understand the molecular basis for fluoroquinolone resistance in VGS causing bacteraemia in cancer patients by assigning 115 VGS bloodstream isolates to specific species using multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), by sequencing the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE, and by testing strain susceptibility to various fluoroquinolones. Non-susceptibility to one or more fluoroquinolones was observed for 78% of isolates, however only 68.7% of patients were receiving fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. All but one of the determinative QRDR polymorphisms occurred in GyrA or ParC, yet the pattern of determinative QRDR polymorphisms was significantly associated with the fluoroquinolone prophylaxis received. By combining MLSA and QRDR data, multiple patients infected with genetically indistinguishable fluoroquinolone-resistant Streptococcus mitis or Streptococcus oralis strains were discovered. Together these data delineate the molecular mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in VGS isolates causing bacteraemia and suggest possible transmission of fluoroquinolone-resistant S. mitis and S. oralis isolates among cancer patients.

24164096,"Evidence for clinical, genetic and biochemical variability in spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy","Spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME) is a recently delineated, autosomal recessive condition caused by rare mutations in the N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1 (acid ceramidase) ASAH1 gene. It is characterized by motor neuron disease followed by progressive myoclonic seizures and eventual death due to respiratory insufficiency. Here we report an adolescent female who presented with atonic and absence seizures and myoclonic jerks and was later diagnosed as having myoclonic-absence seizures. An extensive genetic and metabolic work-up was unable to arrive at a molecular diagnosis. Whole exome sequencing (WES) identified two rare, deleterious mutations in the ASAH1 gene: c.850G>T;p.Gly284X and c.456A>C;p.Lys152Asn. These mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the patient and her parents. Functional studies in cultured fibroblasts showed that acid ceramidase was reduced in both overall amount and enzymatic activity. Ceramide level was doubled in the patient's fibroblasts as compared to control cells. The results of the WES and the functional studies prompted an electromyography (EMG) study that showed evidence of motor neuron disease despite only mild proximal muscle weakness. These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum of SMA-PME caused by novel mutations in ASAH1 and highlight the clinical utility of WES for rare, intractable forms of epilepsy. ",1

19587235,Tumor suppressor function of laminin-binding alpha-dystroglycan requires a distinct beta3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase,"Alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) represents a highly glycosylated cell surface molecule that is expressed in the epithelial cell-basement membrane (BM) interface and plays an essential role in epithelium development and tissue organization. The alpha-DG-mediated epithelial cell-BM interaction is often impaired in invasive carcinomas, yet roles and underlying mechanisms of such an impaired interaction in tumor progression remain unclear. We report here a suppressor function of laminin-binding glycans on alpha-DG in tumor progression. In aggressive prostate and breast carcinoma cell lines, laminin-binding glycans are dramatically decreased, although the amount of alpha-DG and beta-dystroglycan is maintained. The decrease of laminin-binding glycans and consequent increased cell migration were associated with the decreased expression of beta3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 (beta3GnT1). Forced expression of beta3GnT1 in aggressive cancer cells restored the laminin-binding glycans and decreased tumor formation. beta3GnT1 was found to be required for laminin-binding glycan synthesis through formation of a complex with LARGE, thus regulating the function of LARGE. Interaction of the laminin-binding glycans with laminin and other adhesive molecules in BM attenuates tumor cell migratory potential by antagonizing ERK/AKT phosphorylation induced by the components in the ECM. These results identify a previously undescribed role of carbohydrate-dependent cell-BM interaction in tumor suppression and its control by beta3GnT1 and LARGE.",1
23135473,Expression and the clinical significance of Wnt10a and Wnt10b in endometrial             cancer are associated with the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway,"To determine the role played by the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in the development of endometrial cancer (EC), we examined the expression of Wnt10a and Wnt10b in EC tissues and the correlation between their expression. Furthermore, the associations between these two proteins and the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of EC were also evaluated. In our search of alternative mechanisms, we investigated the impact of Wnt10b on proliferation and apoptosis of EC cells. Western blotting, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the expression of Wnt10b and some key proteins of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, proliferation and apoptosis in EC. Our results showed that Wnt10b expression in EC tissues was significantly higher compared to that in hyperplastic and normal samples. The expression of Wnt10a in endometrioid cancer tissues was higher compared to that in other types of cancerous samples. The difference in Wnt10b levels was significant among subgroups for histological type, grade of differentiation, FIGO phase and lymphovascular metastasis. Furthermore, no correlation was observed between the expression of Wnt10a and Wnt10b. In the follow-up, Wnt10b gene expression was frequently upregulated in EC and associated with better prognostic clinicopathological markers in EC patients. Collectively, the in vitro data showed that the upregulated expression of Wnt10b in Ishikawa cells promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptosis through beta-catenin and c-myc activation and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) inhibition, which suggests that Wnt10b activates EC via the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. These results suggest that Wnt10b likely plays an important role in the development of EC. Furthermore, these results identify a role for Wnt10b in EC cells through promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis, primarily through the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. The role played by Wnt10a in EC, however, still requires further investigation.",0
28491482,Long-Term Prophylaxis and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Intramuscular Nano- and Microparticle Decoquinate in Mice Infected with P. berghei Sporozoites,"Decoquinate nanoparticle and microparticle suspended in an oily vehicle to retard drug release are evaluated for long-term malaria prophylaxis. Pharmacokinetic studies in normal animals and antimalarial efficacy in liver stage malaria mice were conducted at various single intramuscular-decoquinate doses for 2, 4, 6, or 8 weeks prior to infection with P. berghei sporozoites. The liver stage efficacy evaluation was monitored by using an in vivo imaging system. Full causal prophylaxis was shown in mice with a single intramuscular dose at 120 mg/kg of nanoparticle decoquinate (0.43 mum) for 2-3 weeks and with microparticle decoquinate (8.31 mum) injected 8 weeks earlier than inoculation. The time above MIC of 1,375 hr observed with the microparticle formulation provided a 2.2-fold longer drug exposure than with the nanoparticle formulation (624 hr). The prophylactic effect of the microparticle formulation observed in mice was shown to be 3-4 times longer than the nanoparticle decoquinate formulation.",0
2538288,Non surgical treatment of subdural hematoma in a hemodialysis patient,"The development of subdural hematoma in the course of hemodialysis treatment has been well documented in the literature. We report a case of a subdural hematoma in a patient on hemodialysis, in whom surgery was contraindicated, due to her concurrent use of anticoagulants. Good recovery was achieved by steroid treatment. Although surgical removal constitutes the essential therapeutic approach for subdural hematoma, we emphasize the importance of medical management in special cases where surgery is contraindicated.",0
9627582,Inherited and de novo androgen receptor gene mutations: investigation of single-case families,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess somatic and inherited androgen receptor gene mutations in families with only one affected individual. METHODS: Molecular genetic analysis of the androgen receptor gene in DNA derived from blood leukocytes from 30 families with single-strand conformation analysis, direct sequencing, and restriction fragment analysis was performed. RESULTS: In 22 families the mothers and all investigated grandmothers were heterozygous carriers. However, within the sisters and aunts, both heterozygous carriers and noncarriers were present. In eight families a de novo mutation was characterized. In three of these patients indication for somatic mosaicism was found. CONCLUSIONS: De novo mutations occur at a high rate within the androgen receptor gene (8 of 30 = 26.7%); a high proportion (3 of 8) arise after the zygote stage. Thus only direct analysis of the underlying mutation of the androgen receptor gene in the proband and his or her family can provide the basis for genetic counseling.",1
21873232,Microbe domestication and the identification of the wild genetic stock of lager-brewing yeast,"Domestication of plants and animals promoted humanity's transition from nomadic to sedentary lifestyles, demographic expansion, and the emergence of civilizations. In contrast to the well-documented successes of crop and livestock breeding, processes of microbe domestication remain obscure, despite the importance of microbes to the production of food, beverages, and biofuels. Lager-beer, first brewed in the 15th century, employs an allotetraploid hybrid yeast, Saccharomyces pastorianus (syn. Saccharomyces carlsbergensis), a domesticated species created by the fusion of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae ale-yeast with an unknown cryotolerant Saccharomyces species. We report the isolation of that species and designate it Saccharomyces eubayanus sp. nov. because of its resemblance to Saccharomyces bayanus (a complex hybrid of S. eubayanus, Saccharomyces uvarum, and S. cerevisiae found only in the brewing environment). Individuals from populations of S. eubayanus and its sister species, S. uvarum, exist in apparent sympatry in Nothofagus (Southern beech) forests in Patagonia, but are isolated genetically through intrinsic postzygotic barriers, and ecologically through host-preference. The draft genome sequence of S. eubayanus is 99.5% identical to the non-S. cerevisiae portion of the S. pastorianus genome sequence and suggests specific changes in sugar and sulfite metabolism that were crucial for domestication in the lager-brewing environment. This study shows that combining microbial ecology with comparative genomics facilitates the discovery and preservation of wild genetic stocks of domesticated microbes to trace their history, identify genetic changes, and suggest paths to further industrial improvement.",0
30150698,Global long-term observations of coastal erosion and accretion,"Changes in coastal morphology have broad consequences for the sustainability of coastal communities, structures and ecosystems. Although coasts are monitored locally in many places, understanding long-term changes at a global scale remains a challenge. Here we present a global and consistent evaluation of coastal morphodynamics over 32 years (1984-2015) based on satellite observations. Land losses and gains were estimated from the changes in water presence along more than 2 million virtual transects. We find that the overall surface of eroded land is about 28,000 km(2), twice the surface of gained land, and that often the extent of erosion and accretion is in the order of km. Anthropogenic factors clearly emerge as the dominant driver of change, both as planned exploitation of coastal resources, such as building coastal structures, and as unforeseen side effects of human activities, for example the installment of dams, irrigation systems and structures that modify the flux of sediments, or the clearing of coastal ecosystems, such as mangrove forests. Another important driver is the occurrence of natural disasters such as tsunamis and extreme storms. The observed global trend in coastal erosion could be enhanced by Sea Level Rise and more frequent extreme events under a changing climate.",0
2182121,Induction of a human carbonyl reductase gene located on chromosome 21,"Carbonyl reductase (EC 1.1.1.184) belongs to the group of enzymes called aldo-keto reductases. It is a NADPH-dependent cytosolic protein with specificity for many carbonyl compounds including the antitumor anthracycline antibiotics, daunorubicin and doxorubicin. Human carbonyl reductase was cloned from a breast cancer cell line (MCF-7). The cDNA clone contained 1219 base paires with an open reading frame corresponding to 277 amino acids encoding a protein of Mr 30,375. Southern analysis of genomic DNA digested with several restriction enzymes and analyzed by hybridization with a labeled cDNA probe indicated that carbonyl reductase is probably coded by a single gene and does not belong to a family of structurally similar enzymes. Southern analysis of 17 mouse/human somatic cell hybrids showed that carbonyl reductase is located on chromosome 21. Carbonyl reductase mRNA could be induced 3-4-fold in 24 h with 10 microM 2,(3)-t-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (BHA), beta-naphthoflavone or Sudan 1.",1
6296869,Chromosomal assignment of the gene for the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor,"Chinese hamster fibroblasts (CHW) fail to physiologically respond to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol with an increase in cellular cAMP. This unresponsiveness is due to a lack of beta-adrenergic receptors as indicated by an absence of specific binding of 125I-labeled hydroxybenzylpindolol (125I-HYP) to CHW plasma membranes. Preparation of somatic cell hybrids between CHW and human peripheral blood leukocytes led to the selection of a panel of 15 human-Chinese hamster cell hybrid clones, some of which had beta 2-adrenergic receptors (specifically bound 125I-HYP) and responded to isoproterenol (accumulated cAMP). Biochemical analysis of independent cloned cell hybrids indicated that beta 2-adrenergic receptor density and the intensity of the associated physiological response were closely correlated (r = 0.98). Both of these parameters were concordant in all cell hybrids with the presence of human chromosome 5. All other human chromosomes could be ruled out. These results suggest that the structural gene for the beta 2-adrenergic receptor is found on human chromosome 5.",1
31185773,Effect of laterality discrimination on joint position sense and cervical range of motion in patients with chronic neck pain: a randomized single-blind clinical trial,"Purpose: The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of laterality discrimination training on neck joint position sense and cervical range of motion (ROM) in patients with chronic non-specific neck pain (NSCNP). Materials and methods: Forty-eight patients with NSCNP were randomly assigned to the neck group (NG) that observed neck images or the foot group (FG) that observed foot images. Response time, response accuracy, cervical ROM, and joint position error (JPE) were the main variables. The secondary outcome measures included psychosocial variables. Results: Differences between groups in the cervical ROM for flexion (p = .043) were obtained, being NG group the one which obtained greater values. NG showed an improvement in right rotation (p = .018) and a decrease in flexion was found in the FG (p = .039). In JPE, differences between groups were obtained in the left rotation (p = .021) and significant changes were found in the NG for flexion, extension, and left rotation movements (p < .05). Moderate associations were found between left and right accuracy regarding to post-intervention flexion and right rotation (r = 0.46, r = 0.41; p < .05) in NG. Conclusion: Improvements in cervical range of motion and joint position sense are obtained after the performance of the laterality discrimination task of images of the neck but not the feet. Visualization of images of the painful region presents moderate correlations with the accuracy and response time in the movements of flexion and right rotation.",0
9060999,Identification of novel human tumor cell-specific CaMK-II variants,"CaMK-II (the (type II) multifunctional Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase) has been implicated in diverse neuronal and non-neuronal functions, including cell growth control. CaMKII expression was evaluated in a variety of human tumor cell lines using RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase coupled polymerase chain reaction). PCR primers which flanked the CaMK-II variable domain were used so that all possible variants of the four mammalian CaMK-II genes (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) could be identified. 8 distinct CaMK-II isozymes were identified from human mammary tumor and neuroblastoma cell cDNA, each of which represented a variant of beta, gamma or delta CaMK-II. They included 2 beta isozymes (beta e, beta 'e), 4 gamma isozymes (gamma B, gamma C, gamma G, gamma H) and 2 delta isozymes (delta C, delta E) This is the first report of human beta and delta CaMK-II sequences. A panel of human cell types was then screened for these CaMK-II isozymes. As expected, cerebral cortex predominately expressed alpha, beta and delta A CaMK-II. In contrast, tumor cells, including those of neuronal origin, expressed an entirely different spectrum of CaMK-II isozymes than adult neuronal tissue. Tumor cells of diverse tissue origin uniformly lacked alpha CaMK-II and expressed 1-2 beta isozymes, at least 3 gamma isozymes and 1-2 delta isozymes. When compared to undifferentiated fibroblasts, beta e, beta'e, gamma G and gamma H were preferentially expressed in tumor cells. CaMK-II immunoblots also indicated that neuroblastoma and mammary tumor cells express isozymes of CaMK-II not present in their non-transformed cell or tissue counterpart. The identification of these new, potential tumor-specific CaMK-II variants supports previous indications that CaMK-II plays a role in growth control. In addition, these results provide insight into both splice variant switching and variable domain structural similarities among all CaMK-II isozymes.",1
11470508,Evidence for alternate splicing within the mRNA transcript encoding the DNA damage response kinase ATR,"Proper cellular response to genotoxic insult often requires the activity of one or more members of a family of high-molecular weight protein kinases referred to as phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PIK)-like proteins. While catalytic activity is an indispensable part of PIK-like protein function, little is currently known about factors that control their activity and/or functions. This deficiency stems, in large part, from our lack of knowledge concerning functionally significant subdomains within the large non-catalytic domain of these proteins. We have determined that the transcript encoding the PIK-like protein ATR undergoes alternate splicing within the region of the mRNA encoding its non-catalytic domain. This conclusion is based on the sequencing of a human expressed sequence tag clone encoding a portion of the ATR cDNA, and is supported by the results of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays conducted on total and polyA+ RNA, as well as sequencing of cloned RT-PCR products. Cloning and sequencing of a segment of human genomic DNA indicated that this event arises from splicing of a single 192 bp exon within the ATR gene. Analysis of several human tissues indicated that alternate ATR transcripts are differentially expressed, suggesting that this region of the ATR protein may be of functional importance.",1
6354175,Human liver alcohol dehydrogenase: ADH Indianapolis results from genetic polymorphism at the ADH2 gene locus,"New molecular forms of human liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), collectively designed ADH Indianapolis (ADHInd), were recently discovered in 29% of liver specimens from Black Americans [Bosron, W. F., Li, T.-K., and Vallee, B. L. (1981). Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA 77:5784]. Three different ADHInd phenotypes have now been identified by starch gel electrophoresis, and four ADHInd enzyme forms isolated by affinity and ion-exchange chromatography. The most cathodic ADHInd form has a single pH optimum at 7.0 for ethanol oxidation and is a homodimer of a newly discovered subunit, as evidenced by dissociation--recombination studies. The remaining three purified ADHInd forms have dual pH optima for ethanol oxidation at 7.0 and 10.0 and generate two new bands on starch gel electrophoresis after dissociation-recombination. They appear to be heterodimers of this new subunit with the known subunits, alpha, beta 1, and gamma 1. Based on the occurrence of these four ADHInd isozymes and isozymes containing beta 1 subunits in the homogenate supernatants of 135 livers, we conclude that ADHInd results from polymorphism at the ADH2 locus, with the variant ADH2Ind allele coding for the beta Ind subunit. The frequency of ADH2Ind was 0.16 in Black Americans. The frequency of the ADH31 and ADH32 alleles also differed in these two populations.",1

The central importance of understanding beta2GPI physiology from the perspective of the rheumatologist is that it forms the foundation for understanding the pathophysiology underlying autoantibody generation, and the diverse mechanisms by which anti-beta2GPI antibodies in complex with beta2GPI may predispose an individual to the antiphospholipid syndrome clinical phenotype. This review examines some of the latest novel findings in this area.",1
30186141,Leukoerythroblastosis with Cytopenia as an Initial Presentation of Lung Adenocarcinoma,"A 74-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) previously treated with fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab (FCR) 5 years ago, presented with progressive fatigue, mucocutaneous bleeding, and cytopenias (hemoglobin 51 g/L, platelets 8.0 x 10(9)/L, lymphocytes 0.4 x 10(9)/L). He had normal respiratory findings, and no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Further workup revealed a small spiculated lung nodule and multiple sclerotic bony lesions. Due to bleeding/profound thrombocytopenia, lung biopsy was not feasible. Peripheral smear revealed leukoerythroblastosis with few nucleated red blood cells and left shift of granulocytes. Bone marrow (BM) aspirate yielded a dry tap with clusters of extrinsic atypical cells on touch preparations. BM core biopsy showed infiltration and near complete replacement by a population of highly atypical cells with surrounding fibrosis. Cells were positive for cytokeratins CK7 and CK8/18, Napsin A, and thyroid transcription factor-1, specific for a primary poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma. Leukoerythroblastosis in association with cytopenia often indicates a BM infiltration and warrants an early BM biopsy to rule out hematological and solid malignancies, particularly in CLL patients treated with FCR. In our case, a diagnosis of a lung adenocarcinoma was established by BM examination, the only clinically feasible diagnostic modality.",0
10233894,"Vascular endothelial genes that are responsive to tumor necrosis factor-alpha in vitro are expressed in atherosclerotic lesions, including inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1, stannin, and two novel genes","Activation and dysfunction of endothelial cells play a prominent role in patho-physiological processes such as atherosclerosis. We describe the identification by differential display of 106 cytokine-responsive gene fragments from endothelial cells, activated by monocyte conditioned medium or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. A minority of the fragments (22/106) represent known genes involved in various processes, including leukocyte trafficking, vesicular transport, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and cellular protection against oxidative stress. Full-length cDNA clones were obtained for five novel transcripts that were induced or repressed more than 10-fold in vitro. These novel human cDNAs CA2_1, CG12_1, GG10_2, AG8_1, and GG2_1 encode inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (hIAP-1), homologues of apolipoprotein-L, mouse rabkinesin-6, rat stannin, and a novel 188 amino acid protein, respectively. Expression of 4 novel transcripts is shown by in situ hybridization on healthy and atherosclerotic vascular tissue, using monocyte chemotactic protein-1 as a marker for inflammation. CA2_1 (hIAP-1) and AG8_1 are expressed by endothelial cells and macrophage foam cells of the inflamed vascular wall. CG12_1 (apolipoprotein-L like) was specifically expressed in endothelial cells lining the normal and atherosclerotic iliac artery and aorta. These results substantiate the complex change in the gene expression pattern of vascular endothelial cells, which accompanies the inflammatory reaction of atherosclerotic lesions.",1

These pseudomonads were cultured from purulent sputa postoperatively and sometimes caused systemic disease. The epidemic type was traced to a ventilator and a nebulizer whilst the endemic and endogenous types were not found in environmental sites. Effective decontamination of equipment and the use of bacterial filters where possible are essential in preventing the spread of infection. Staff hygiene remains important, particularly hand washing with antiseptic soap preparations.",0
23393093,The C9orf72 GGGGCC repeat is translated into aggregating dipeptide-repeat proteins in FTLD/ALS,"Expansion of a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat upstream of the C9orf72 coding region is the most common cause of familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTLD/ALS), but the pathomechanisms involved are unknown. As in other FTLD/ALS variants, characteristic intracellular inclusions of misfolded proteins define C9orf72 pathology, but the core proteins of the majority of inclusions are still unknown. Here, we found that most of these characteristic inclusions contain poly-(Gly-Ala) and, to a lesser extent, poly-(Gly-Pro) and poly-(Gly-Arg) dipeptide-repeat proteins presumably generated by non-ATG-initiated translation from the expanded GGGGCC repeat in three reading frames. These findings directly link the FTLD/ALS-associated genetic mutation to the predominant pathology in patients with C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion.",1

11394875,Expression of attractin and its differential enzyme activity in glioma cells,"Attractin/mahogany protein was previously shown to be involved in a number of physiological and pathological events, including immune system regulation, body weight control, pigmentation, myelinization, and tumor susceptibility. Human attractin has an enzymatic activity resembling dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). In the central nervous system, attractin has been detected in neurons but not in glial cells up to now. We show the expression of attractin mRNA and protein in glioma cell lines at different degree of transformation. In human U373 and U87 glioma cells (Grades III and IV), membrane-bound attractin displays hydrolytic activity amounting to 5 and 25% of total cellular DPP-IV-like enzyme activity, respectively. Such activity has not been observed in the rat C6 glioma cells (Grade I). Attractin presence in glioma, but not in normal glial cells, together with its differential enzymatic activity, suggests its role in growth properties of tumors of glial cell origin.",1

ADH2 and ALDH2 genotypes were examined using PCR and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. Alcohol drinkers with the ALDH2 A allele showed a significantly increased risk of esophageal cancer compared with drinkers with the ALDH2 G/G genotype (odds ratio (OR)=3.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.65-5.78) or nondrinkers with any genotype (OR=3.05, 95% CI: 1.49-6.25). Drinkers with the ALDH2 A allele and a cumulative amount of alcohol consumption > or =2.5 (kg * years) were at a significantly higher risk of developing esophageal cancer (OR=11.93, 95% CI: 3.17-44.90) compared with individuals with ALDH2 G/G genotypes and a cumulative amount of alcohol consumption <2.5 (kg * years). A dose-dependent positive result was found between cumulative amount of alcohol consumption and risk of esophageal cancer in individuals carrying the ALDH2 A allele (P=0.023) and the homozygous ALDH2 G allele (P=0.047). Compared with individuals carrying both ALDH2 G/G and ADH2 A/A alleles and with a cumulative amount of alcohol consumption <2.5 (kg * years), drinkers carrying both ALDH2 A and ADH2 G alleles and with a cumulative amount of alcohol consumption > or =2.5 (kg * years) showed a significantly elevated risk of esophageal cancer (OR=53.15, 95% CI: 4.24-666.84). This result suggests that to help lower their risk for esophageal cancer, persons carrying the ALDH2 A allele should be encouraged to reduce their consumption of alcoholic beverages.",1

Often overlooked is how the language we use to describe and understand families affects how we work with them. The language we use in thinking about a family can shape our perceptions of the family and may affect how we approach working with them. The language we use in describing a family to another health care provider can affect how that person will perceive and approach the family.

16283883,Frameshift and nonsense mutations in the gene for ATPase7B are associated with severe impairment of copper metabolism and with an early clinical manifestation of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The clinical phenotype of the disease is varied. It is proposed that this variation may be a result of differential functional disruption of ATPase7B (ATP7B) resulting from mutations in the gene ATP7B. We aimed to assess the relationship between specific mutational defects in ATP7B and divergence in the phenotypic expression of WD. One hundred and forty-two patients with clinically, biochemically and genetically diagnosed WD were included in the study. The phenotypic expression of WD was compared between patients with different types of mutations in ATP7B, detected by direct sequencing of exons 1-21 of the gene. Twenty-six mutations were identified in ATP7B; eleven of them were mutations predicted to result in the absence of a full-length normal protein [frameshift/nonsense mutations; classified as 'severe' mutations (SMs)], 14 were missense mutations (MMs) and one was a splice site mutation. Patients with one or two SMs on their alleles had lower serum copper and ceruloplasmin and were younger when the first symptoms of the disease appeared, compared with individuals with two MMs. The effect of SMs on the WD phenotype was dose-dependent. It is concluded that mutations within ATP7B are very heterogeneous. Frameshift and nonsense mutations are associated with a severe phenotype of WD.",1
31676069,Nobiletin and related polymethoxylated flavones bind to and inhibit the nuclear export factor Exportin-1 in NK leukemia cell line KHYG-1,"Polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) are naturally occurring compounds that have biological effects on many cell types. We previously demonstrated that PMFs such as nobiletin potentiate the cytolytic activity of the human leukemic natural killer cell line KHYG-1 and increased level of the cytotoxic protein granzyme B (GrB) and the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). However, the precise mechanisms by which this occurs remain to be elucidated. In this study, we sought to identify and investigate the function of intracellular primary targets of the PMFs in KHYG-1cells. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we identified that 3'-hydroxy-4',5,6,7-tetramethoxyflavone (TMF) binds to the nuclear export factors Exportin-1 and -2 (XPO1 and XPO2) as TMF-binding proteins and demonstrated that nobiletin competes with TMF for XPO1 binding, suggesting that nobiletin also binds to XPO1. Treatment of KHYG-1cells with leptomycin B, a specific XPO1 inhibitor, increased the expression of GrB and IFN-gamma but did not potentiate lysis of specific target cells, suggesting that the cargo of XPO1 contributes to the expression of cytolytic genes but that this alone is insufficient to enhance cytolysis. Consistent with this, nobiletin and related PMFs induced the nuclear retention of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor that promotes GrB and IFN-gamma expression. PMFs also induced the nuclear retention of the tumor suppressor protein p53, a known XPO1 cargo protein, resulting in KHYG-1cell cycle arrest. Collectively, these results suggest that PMFs modulate KHYG-1 function, at least in part, by inhibiting XPO1.",0
21351256,miR-34c is downregulated in prostate cancer and exerts tumor suppressive functions,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. There have been several reports of miRNA deregulation in prostate cancer (PCa) and the biological evidence for an involvement of miRNAs in prostate tumorigenesis is increasing. In this study, we show that miR-34c is downregulated in PCa (p = 0.0005) by performing qRT-PCR on 49 TURPs from PCa patients compared to 25 from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The miR-34c expression was found to inversely correlate to aggressiveness of the tumor, WHO grade, PSA levels and occurrence of metastases. Furthermore, a Kaplan-Meier analysis of patient survival based on miR-34c expression levels divided into low (< 50th percentile) and high (> 50th percentile) expression, significantly divides the patients into high risk and low risk patients (p = 0.0003, log-rank test). The phenotypic effects of miR-34c deregulation were studied in prostate cell lines, where ectopic expression of miR-34c decreased cell growth, due to both a decrease in cellular proliferation rate and an increase in apoptosis. In concordance to this, miR-34c was found to negatively regulate the oncogenes E2F3 and BCL-2, which stimulates proliferation and suppress apoptosis in PCa cells, respectively. Reversely, we could also show that blocking miR-34c in vitro increases cell growth. Further, ectopic expression of miR-34c was found to suppress migration and invasion. Our findings provide new insight into the role of miR-34c in the prostate, exhibiting tumor suppressing effects on proliferation, apoptosis and invasiveness.",0
30777585,The relationship between parasite virulence and environmental persistence: a meta-analysis,"Why some parasites evolve and maintain extreme levels of virulence is a question that remains largely unanswered. A body of theory predicts that parasites that form long-lived spores able to persist in the environment evolve higher virulence, known as the sit and wait hypothesis. Such parasites can obliterate their local host population and wait in the environment for further hosts to arrive, reducing some of the costs of high virulence. On the other hand, some models predict the opposite to be true, that virulence and environmental persistence are both costly and traded off, the resource allocation hypothesis. I conducted a meta-analysis on published data on the relationship between environmental persistence and virulence collected to date. I first examined all data available to date and then conducted a smaller analysis focussing on just those studies testing the specific predictions of the sit and wait hypothesis. Empirical work supports both hypotheses; however, the direction of the effect is largely associated with parasite type. In both analyses, viruses tend to show evidence of resource allocation trade-offs, these traits are positively correlated in bacterial and fungal parasites.",0

METHODS: A prospective, open study in patients with symptomatic (>or=50 mm and <or=90 mm on a 100 mm VAS) ankle osteoarthritis. Patients received 1 ml x 2 ml intra-articular injection of hylan G-F 20, plus an optional, second injection if pain remained at baseline levels after 1, 2 or 3 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the pain VAS score at 3 months. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients received the first injection; 24 patients received a second. There were no serious or severe adverse events (AEs) related to the treatment. Seventeen patients experienced mild or moderate local, treatment-related AEs. The mean pain VAS score decreased from 68.0 mm (baseline) to 33.8 mm at 3 months (p<0.001), which was maintained to 6 months (34.2 mm, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Hylan G-F 20 is well-tolerated and effective for up to 6 months in the treatment of symptomatic ankle osteoarthritis.",0
17661343,Prognostic significance of p16 INK4a alteration for Ewing sarcoma: a meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Despite findings from individual studies regarding prognostic factors for Ewing sarcoma, no conclusive results have been produced, partly because of small sample sizes. The objective of the current study was to evaluate whether the presence of p16(INK4a) alteration is associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with Ewing sarcomas. METHODS: A review was conducted of publications that assessed associations between p16(INK4a) status and 2-year survival among patients with Ewing sarcoma. The association between metastatic disease at initial diagnosis and 2-year survival was evaluated by synthesizing data in the form of risk ratios. RESULTS: Of 11 studies that were identified in the initial search strategy, 6 studies, representing 188 patients, met the inclusion criteria and, consequently, were pooled for quantitative analyses. The estimated pooled risk ratio of p16(INK4a) aberration was 2.17 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.55-3.03; P < .001), whereas the estimated pooled risk ratio of metastasis at diagnosis among the 164 eligible patients was 2.60 (95% CI, 1.71-3.97; P < .001). There was no statistically significant difference in the pooled estimated risk ratios of p16(INK4a) aberration for a poor prognosis between patients with and without metastasis at diagnosis (1.86 and 2.21, respectively; P > .59). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of p16(INK4a) alteration was a statistically significant predictor of prognosis for patients with Ewing sarcoma. Along with other prognostic factors, such as metastasis, the p16(INK4a) alteration may be a potential candidate for improving the risk-stratifying strategy for patients with these tumors.",1
8266986,Growth pattern in the Apert syndrome,"In this paper, we demonstrate that a discernible and unique growth pattern characterizes the Apert syndrome. The keys to understanding Apert newborn measurement values are brain size and cranial configuration. Both true megalencephaly and coronal synostosis are present at birth. Thus, the head is unusually heavy and the cranium is disproportionately high. Mean newborn length and weight are above the normal 50th centile. Of our newborn patients, 16% exceeded 4,000 g in weight. Preterm infants were appropriate or slightly large for gestational age. A biphasic linear growth pattern was found. In childhood, deceleration of linear growth occurs so that most values fall between the 5th and 50th centiles. From adolescence to adulthood, deceleration becomes more pronounced. This 2-step linear growth deceleration results in large measure from rhizomelic shortness of the lower limbs. Puberty takes place within the normal time frame. Although a disproportionate amount of the megalencephaly accounts for the dramatic increase in head height, the widely patent midline calvarial defect, allowing the brain to expand anteriorly into the metopic area, and some increase in the head breadth permit the mean head circumference at birth to normalize slightly above the 50th centile. During the growth period, the head circumference was studied in surgically unoperated Apert patients from the 1960s and earlier. The natural history of the growing cranium consists of gradual deceleration in head circumference from slightly above the 50th centile at birth to within or at -2 SD later on.",0
3875483,The chromosomal location of T-cell receptor genes and a T cell rearranging gene: possible correlation with specific translocations in human T cell leukaemia,"We have examined the chromosomal location of human T cell-specific genes which are involved in antigen recognition and of a gene which specifically rearranges in T cells. The genes encoding both the variable and constant region segments of the T cell receptor alpha chain are found on chromosome 14 while the delta chain gene of the T cell receptor-associated T3 complex is localised to chromosome 11. Further, the two tandemly arranged T cell-specific rearranging genes, designated gamma, were mapped to chromosome 7, but apparently not closely linked to the previously mapped T cell receptor beta-chain gene. The locations of the three different genes, which undergo rearrangement in T cells, may correlate with the chromosomal breakpoints known to be involved in translocations within abnormal human T cells.",1
26185260,Nutritional Competence and Resilience among Hemodialysis Patients in the Setting of Dialysis Initiation and Hospitalization,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dialysis patients have a high risk for inadequate nutrition. Their nutritional status is particularly susceptible to deterioration when faced with intercurrent events such as hospitalization. This study was conducted to improve the understanding of the temporal evolution of nutritional parameters as a foundation for rational and proactive nutritional intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A retrospective cohort study was performed to investigate the temporal evolution of nutritional parameters (serum albumin, serum phosphate, serum creatinine, equilibrated normalized protein catabolic rate, and interdialytic weight gain) and a composite nutritional score derived from these parameters, in two populations: (1) incident hemodialysis (HD) patients who started HD between January 2006 and December 2011 and were followed for up to 54 months (median 16.3), and (2) prevalent patients with HD vintage >/=2.5 years who were hospitalized between January 2006 and December 2011 and followed from 6 months before to 6 months after hospitalization. RESULTS: In incident patients (n=126,964), each of the nutritional parameters improved after HD initiation, with a mean composite nutritional score at the 24th percentile at the start of HD and reaching a plateau at the 57th percentile toward the end of the second year on dialysis. Nutritional parameters increased more rapidly and reached higher values among patients who survived longer. In hospitalized patients (n=14,193), the nutritional parameters and the composite score began to decline 1-2 months before hospitalization, reached their lowest level in the month after hospitalization, and then partially recovered in the subsequent 5 months. The degree of recovery of the nutritional score was inversely related to the number of rehospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: This study increases the understanding of nutritional resilience and its determinants in HD patients. Application of the nutritional score, pending further validation, may facilitate targeted and timely interventions to avert the negative consequences of inadequate nutrition in chronic HD patients.",0
22977511,Low molecular weight heparin suppresses tissue factor-mediated cancer cell invasion and migration in vitro,"Elevated expression of tissue factor (TF) has been associated with an increased risk of thrombosis in the majority of cancers. Moreover, treatment of cancer patients with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) appears to have beneficial effects that reach beyond controlling the immediate hypercoagulable state. In this study, we investigated the influence of the treatment of cancer cells with LMWH (0-2,000 mug/ml) on cell invasiveness and migration in cancer cell lines from five separate tissues; pancreatic, breast, colocarcinoma, ovarian and melanoma. The rate of cell invasion across collagen IV-coated membranes was suppressed in all cell lines tested on incubation with 2,000 mug/ml LMWH, but BxPC-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells also responded to the lowest concentration of 20 mug/ml LMWH. Furthermore, the rate of cell migration was reduced to varying extents in all of the cell lines tested on incubation with 20 mug/ml or higher concentrations of LMWH. The decrease in the rates of invasion and migration also strongly correlated with the reduction in TF protein expression and TF activity in these cells following incubation with LMWH. Moreover, the LMWH-mediated decreases in cellular invasion in the most affected cell lines (BxPC-3 and MDA-MB-231) were restored by transfection of the cells with the mammalian pCMV-XL5-TF expression vector allowing independent overexpression of TF. In conclusion, LMWH appears to suppress the rate of cancer cell invasion and migration in vitro, through a mechanism that is at least in part dependent on the TF protein expression and activity in cancer cells.",0
30539814,An enriched environment promotes synaptic plasticity and cognitive recovery after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice,"Cerebral ischemia activates an endogenous repair program that induces plastic changes in neurons. In this study, we investigated the effects of environmental enrichment on spatial learning and memory as well as on synaptic remodeling in a mouse model of chronic cerebral ischemia, produced by subjecting adult male C57BL/6 mice to permanent left middle cerebral artery occlusion. Three days postoperatively, mice were randomly assigned to the environmental enrichment and standard housing groups. Mice in the standard housing group were housed and fed a standard diet. Mice in the environmental enrichment group were housed in a cage with various toys and fed a standard diet. Then, 28 days postoperatively, spatial learning and memory were tested using the Morris water maze. The expression levels of growth-associated protein 43, synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95 in the hippocampus were analyzed by western blot assay. The number of synapses was evaluated by electron microscopy. In the water maze test, mice in the environmental enrichment group had a shorter escape latency, traveled markedly longer distances, spent more time in the correct quadrant (northeast zone), and had a higher frequency of crossings compared with the standard housing group. The expression levels of growth-associated protein 43, synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95 were substantially upregulated in the hippocampus in the environmental enrichment group compared with the standard housing group. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed that environmental enrichment increased the number of synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region. Collectively, these findings suggest that environmental enrichment ameliorates the spatial learning and memory impairment induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. Environmental enrichment in mice with cerebral ischemia likely promotes cognitive recovery by inducing plastic changes in synapses.",0
1858338,Biotransformation and toxicity of xenobiotics in various routes of administration of vitamin A into the rat body,"Deficiency of vitamin A in rats caused a decrease in metabolic rate of acetanilide as well as in elimination of voltaren from blood plasma, while excess of the vitamin (3,000 IU/kg) stimulated voltaren elimination and increased excretion with urine of aminophenol conjugates of acetanilide with sulfuric and glucuronic acids. Under conditions of vitamin A deficiency formation of acetanilide toxic metabolites was increased as a result of which excretion of mercapturic acids with urine was elevated but excess of vitamin A and its hyperdose inhibited these reactions. At the same time, deficiency of vitamin A amplified the paracetamol and voltaren toxicity and its excess exhibited protective effects.",0
12958364,Dishevelled 2 recruits beta-arrestin 2 to mediate Wnt5A-stimulated endocytosis of Frizzled 4,"Wnt proteins, regulators of development in many organisms, bind to seven transmembrane-spanning (7TMS) receptors called frizzleds, thereby recruiting the cytoplasmic molecule dishevelled (Dvl) to the plasma membrane.Frizzled-mediated endocytosis of Wg (a Drosophila Wnt protein) and lysosomal degradation may regulate the formation of morphogen gradients. Endocytosis of Frizzled 4 (Fz4) in human embryonic kidney 293 cells was dependent on added Wnt5A protein and was accomplished by the multifunctional adaptor protein beta-arrestin 2 (betaarr2), which was recruited to Fz4 by binding to phosphorylated Dvl2. These findings provide a previously unrecognized mechanism for receptor recruitment of beta-arrestin and demonstrate that Dvl plays an important role in the endocytosis of frizzled, as well as in promoting signaling.",1
18675899,Antioxidant defense in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury is regulated by damage-associated molecular pattern signal molecules,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury occurs in a variety of clinical settings and generates the release of endogenous noninfectious ligands called damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signal molecules from damaged cells. This study investigates the effect of DAMP molecules released by Kupffer cells (KC) in I/R injury on the expression of liver manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a key mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme. We show that MnSOD expression levels are increased in rats and remain high for 24 h after 30 min of ischemia. KC were damaged and depleted after I/R, in association with MnSOD upregulation. Causality was established by treatment with gadolinium chloride, known to selectively destroy KC, which also increased MnSOD levels. Recovery from the early damage (6 h) to the liver tissue was evidenced after 24 h. A physiological protective role for MnSOD was also confirmed by the increased susceptibility of MnSOD-knockdown AML-12 hepatocyte cells to I/R-induced cell death. Inhibition of DAMP molecule high-mobility group box-1 activity by injection of neutralizing antibody partially abolished the increase in liver MnSOD after I/R. Direct injection of ATP, to animals or cells, stimulated MnSOD upregulation. Another DAMP molecule, monosodium urate, also induced MnSOD expression in hepatocyte AML-12 and FaO cell cultures. In conclusion, a connection between danger signals and upregulation of the antioxidant defense system is shown here for the first time in the context of I/R liver injury.",0
32955733,Adhesion molecule cross-linking and cytokine exposure modulate IgE- and non-IgE-dependent basophil activation,"Basophils are known for their role in allergic inflammation, which makes them suitable targets in allergy diagnostics such as the basophil activation test (BAT) and the microfluidic immunoaffinity basophil activation test (miBAT). Beside their role in allergy, basophils have an immune modulatory role in both innate immunity and adaptive immunity. To accomplish this mission, basophils depend on the capability to migrate from blood to extravascular tissues, which includes interactions with endothelial cells, extracellular matrix and soluble mediators. Their receptor repertoire is well known, but less is known how these receptor-ligand interactions impact the degranulation process and the responsiveness to subsequent activation. As the consequences of these interactions are crucial to fully appreciate the role of basophils in immune modulation and to enable optimization of the miBAT, we explored how basophil activation status is regulated by cytokines and cross-linking of adhesion molecules. The expression of adhesion molecules and activation markers on basophils from healthy blood donors was analysed by flow cytometry. Cross-linking of CD203c, CD62L, CD11b and CD49d induced a significant upregulation of CD63 and CD203c. To mimic in vivo conditions, valid also for miBAT, CD62L and CD49d were cross-linked followed by IgE-dependent activation (anti-IgE), which caused a reduced CD63 expression compared with anti-IgE activation only. IL-3 and IL-33 priming caused increased CD63 expression after IgE-independent activation (fMLP). Together, our data suggest that mechanisms operational both in the microfluidic chip and in vivo during basophil adhesion may impact basophil anaphylactic and piecemeal degranulation procedures and hence their immune regulatory function.",0
12649162,"Red cell adenylate kinase deficiency: molecular study of 3 new mutations (118G>A, 190G>A, and GAC deletion) associated with hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia","We report here 2 patients with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) and severe red blood cell (RBC) adenylate kinase (AK) deficiency. One of these patients, a boy of Spanish origin, exhibited a neonatal icterus and splenomegaly and required blood transfusions until the age of 2 years. The other patient was a white, American infant born to parents who were first cousins; he also presented with neonatal icterus and anemia. In neither case was psychomotor impairment observed. The first patient was found to be a compound heterozygote for 2 different missense mutations, 118G>A(Gly40Arg) and 190G>A(Gly64Arg) (cDNA sequence first described by Matsuura et al, 1989). The second patient was homozygous for an in-frame deletion (GAC) from nucleotide (nt) 498 to 500 or nt 501 to 503 of the cDNA sequence, predicting deletion of either aspartic acid (Asp) 140 or 141. The crystal structure of porcine cytosolic AK was used as a molecular model to investigate how these mutations may affect enzyme structure and function.",1
11085838,"Videotape-based decision aid for colon cancer screening. A randomized, controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Rates of colon cancer screening in the United States are low, in part because of poor communication between patients and providers about the availability of effective screening options. OBJECTIVE: To test whether a decision aid consisting of an educational video, targeted brochure, and chart marker increased performance of colon cancer screening in primary care practices. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Three community primary care practices in central North Carolina. PATIENTS: 1657 consecutive adult patients 50 to 75 years of age were contacted. Of these, 651 (39%) agreed to participate; 249 of the 651 participants (38%) were eligible. Eligible patients had no personal or family history of colon cancer and had not had fecal occult blood testing in the past year or flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, or barium enema in the past 5 years. INTERVENTION: The 249 participants were randomly assigned to view an 11-minute video about colon cancer screening (intervention group) or a video about automobile safety (control group). After viewing the video, intervention group participants chose a color-coded educational brochure (based on stages of change) to indicate their degree of interest in screening. A chart marker of the same color was attached to their charts. Controls received a generic brochure on automobile safety, and no chart marker was attached. MEASUREMENTS: Frequency of screening test ordering as reported by participants and frequency of completion of screening tests as verified by chart review. RESULTS: Fecal occult blood testing or flexible sigmoidoscopy was ordered for 47.2% of intervention participants and 26.4% of controls (difference, 20.8 percentage points [95% CI, 8.6 to 32.9 percentage points]). Screening tests were completed by 36.8% of the intervention group and 22.6% of the control group (difference, 14.2 percentage points [CI, 3.0 to 25.4 percentage points]). CONCLUSION: A decision aid consisting of an educational video, brochure, and chart marker increased ordering and performance of colon cancer screening tests.",0

19734946,LARG at chromosome 11q23 has functional characteristics of a tumor suppressor in human breast and colorectal cancer,"Deletion of 11q23-q24 is frequent in a diverse variety of malignancies, including breast and colorectal carcinoma, implicating the presence of a tumor suppressor gene at that chromosomal region. We examined a 6-Mb region on 11q23 by high-resolution deletion mapping, using both loss of heterozygosity analysis and customized microarray comparative genomic hybridization. LARG (leukemia-associated Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factor) (also called ARHGEF12), identified from the analysed region, is frequently underexpressed in breast and colorectal carcinomas with a reduced expression observed in all breast cancer cell lines (n=11), in 12 of 38 (32%) primary breast cancers, 5 of 10 (50%) colorectal cell lines and in 20 of 37 (54%) primary colorectal cancers. Underexpression of the LARG transcript was significantly associated with genomic loss (P=0.00334). Hypermethylation of the LARG promoter was not detected in either breast or colorectal cancer, and treatment of four breast and four colorectal cancer cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and/or trichostatin A did not result in a reactivation of LARG. Enforced expression of LARG in breast and colorectal cancer cells by stable transfection resulted in reduced cell proliferation and colony formation, as well as in a markedly slower cell migration rate in colorectal cancer cells, providing functional evidence for LARG as a candidate tumor suppressor gene.",1
18541910,"Bves directly interacts with GEFT, and controls cell shape and movement through regulation of Rac1/Cdc42 activity","Bves is an integral membrane protein with no determined function and no homology to proteins outside of the Popdc family. It is widely expressed throughout development in myriad organisms. Here, we demonstrate an interaction between Bves and guanine nucleotide exchange factor T (GEFT), a GEF for Rho-family GTPases. This interaction represents the first identification of any protein that has a direct physical interaction with any member of the Popdc family. Bves and GEFT are shown to colocalize in adult skeletal muscle. We also demonstrate that exogenous expression of Bves reduces Rac1 and Cdc42 activity levels while not affecting levels of active RhoA. Consistent with a repression of Rac1 and Cdc42 activity, we show changes in speed of cell locomotion and cell roundness also result from exogenous expression of Bves. Modulation of Rho-family GTPase signaling by Bves would be highly consistent with previously described phenotypes occurring upon disruption of Bves function in a wide variety of model systems. Therefore, we propose Bves as a novel regulator of the Rac1 and Cdc42 signaling cascades.",1

19345584,Ribonuclear inclusions and MBNL1 nuclear sequestration do not affect myoblast differentiation but alter gene splicing in myotonic dystrophy type 2,"Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is an autosomal dominant multisystemic disorder caused by a CCTG expansion in intron 1 of the zinc finger protein 9 gene on chromosome 3. Mutant transcripts are retained in muscle nuclei producing ribonuclear inclusions, which can bind specific RNA-binding proteins leading to a reduction in their activity. The nuclear sequestration of muscleblind-like proteins appears to be involved in splicing defects of genes directly related to the myotonic dystrophy phenotypes. Experimental evidence suggests that ribonuclear inclusions and muscleblind-like protein 1 (MBNL1) sequestration are strongly involved in DM2 pathogenesis. By using fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with MBNL1-immunofluorescence, we have observed the presence of ribonuclear inclusions and MBNL1 nuclear sequestration at different time points of in vitro myoblast differentiation in each DM2 patient examined. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of several markers of skeletal muscle differentiation reveal that the degree of differentiation of DM2 myoblasts is comparable to that observed in controls. Nevertheless the splicing pattern of the insulin receptor and MBNL1 transcripts, directly related to the DM2 phenotype, appears to be altered in in vitro differentiated DM2 myotubes. Our data seem indicate that the presence of ribonuclear inclusions and MBNL1 nuclear foci are involved in alteration of alternative splicing but do not impair DM2 myogenic differentiation.",0
15915612,Does health assessment improve health outcomes in indigenous people? An RCT with 13 years of follow-up,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of a multi-component health assessment on mortality and morbidity in Kimberley Aboriginal residents during a 13-year follow-up. METHOD: A population-based randomised controlled trial using linked hospital, cancer and death records to evaluate outcomes in 620 intervention and 6,736 control subjects. RESULTS: The intervention group had a higher rate of first-time hospitalisation for any reason (IRR=1.37; 95% CI 1.25-1.50), a higher rate of injury-related hospital episodes (IRR=1.31; 95% CI 1.15-1.48) and a higher notification rate of alcohol-related cancers. There was a smaller difference in the rates of multiple hospitalisations (IRR=1.14; 95% CI 0.75-1.74) and no improvement in overall mortality compared with controls (IRR=1.08; 95% CI 0.91-1.29). CONCLUSIONS: There was no overall mortality benefit despite increased health service contact associated with the intervention. IMPLICATIONS: Although not influencing mortality rates, multi-component health assessment may result in a period of increased health service use in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations, thus constituting an 'intervention'. However, this should not be confused with systematic and sustained interventions and investment in community development to achieve better health outcomes.",0
28402485,Evolution of Sagittal Imbalance Following Corrective Surgery for Sagittal Plane Deformity,"BACKGROUND: Sagittal balance in adult spinal deformity is a major predictor of quality of life. A temporary loss of paraspinal muscle force and somatic pain following spine surgery may limit a patient's ability to maintain posture. OBJECTIVE: To assess the evolution of sagittal balance and clinical outcomes during recovery from adult spinal deformity surgery. METHODS: Retrospective review of a prospective observational database identified a consecutive series of patients with sagittal vertical axis (SVA) > 40 mm undergoing adult deformity surgery. Radiographic parameters and clinical outcomes were measured out to 2 yr after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 113 consecutive patients met inclusion criteria. Mean preoperative SVA was 90.3 mm, increased to 104.6 mm in the first week, then gradually reduced at each follow-up interval to 59.2 mm at 6 wk, 45.0 mm at 3 mo, 38.6 mm at 6 mo, and 34.1 mm at 1 yr (all P < .05). SVA did not change between 1 and 2 yr. Pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis (PI-LL) corrected immediately from 25.3 degrees  to 8.5 degrees  (16.8 degrees  change; P < .01) and a decreased pelvic tilt from 27.6 degrees  to 17.6 degrees  (10 degrees  change; P < .01). No further change was noted in PI-LL. Pelvic tilt increased to 20.2 degrees  ( P = .01) at 6 wk and held steady through 2 yr. Mean Visual Analog Scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Short Form-36 scores all improved; pain rapidly improved, whereas disability measures improved as SVA improved. CONCLUSION: Radiographic assessment of global sagittal alignment did not fully reflect surgical correction of sagittal balance until 6 mo after adult deformity surgery. Sagittal balance initially worsened then steadily improved at each interval over the first year postoperatively. At 1 yr, all clinical and radiographic measures outcomes were significantly improved.",0
3101769,bcr-abl RNA in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia,"The major consequence of the formation of the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome characteristic of leukemia cells of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is fusion of c-abl and bcr genes. Using a sensitive RNase protection technique, we analyzed mRNA from a large number of CML patients. In most, we identified one or both species of bcr-abl chimeric transcripts. These two mRNAs vary in the specific bcr exon joined to abl exon II and are translated into slightly different proteins. The amounts of the fused mRNA within leukemia cells vary considerably between individuals and do not correlate with the phase of the disease.",1
24798303,Modulation of miR-29 expression by alpha-fetoprotein is linked to the hepatocellular carcinoma epigenome,"UNLABELLED: Globally, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 70%-85% of primary liver cancers and ranks as the second leading cause of male cancer death. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), normally highly expressed in the liver only during fetal development, is reactivated in 60% of HCC tumors and associated with poor patient outcome. We hypothesize that AFP+ and AFP- tumors differ biologically. Multivariable analysis in 237 HCC cases demonstrates that AFP level predicts poor survival independent of tumor stage (P<0.043). Using microarray-based global microRNA (miRNA) profiling, we found that miRNA-29 (miR-29) family members were the most significantly (P<0.001) down-regulated miRNAs in AFP+ tumors. Consistent with miR-29's role in targeting DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), a key enzyme regulating DNA methylation, we found a significant inverse correlation (P<0.001) between miR-29 and DNMT3A gene expression, suggesting that they might be functionally antagonistic. Moreover, global DNA methylation profiling reveals that AFP+ and AFP- HCC tumors have distinct global DNA methylation patterns and that increased DNA methylation is associated with AFP+ HCC. Experimentally, we found that AFP expression in AFP- HCC cells induces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Overexpression of AFP, or conditioned media from AFP+ cells, inhibits miR-29a expression and induces DNMT3A expression in AFP- HCC cells. AFP also inhibited transcription of the miR-29a/b-1 locus, and this effect is mediated through c-MYC binding to the transcript of miR-29a/b-1. Furthermore, AFP expression promotes tumor growth of AFP- HCC cells in nude mice. CONCLUSION: Tumor biology differs considerably between AFP+ HCC and AFP- HCC; AFP is a functional antagonist of miR-29, which may contribute to global epigenetic alterations and poor prognosis in HCC.",0
10053008,Genomic structure of the canalicular multispecific organic anion-transporter gene (MRP2/cMOAT) and mutations in the ATP-binding-cassette region in Dubin-Johnson syndrome,"Dubin-Johnson syndrome (DJS) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Previous studies of the defects in the human canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter gene (MRP2/cMOAT) in patients with DJS have suggested that the gene defects are responsible for DJS. In this study, we determined the exon/intron structure of the human MRP2/cMOAT gene and further characterized mutations in patients with DJS. The human MRP2/cMOAT gene contains 32 exons, and it has a structure that is highly conserved with that of another ATP-binding-cassette gene, that for a multidrug resistance-associated protein. We then identified three mutations, including two novel ones. All mutations identified to date are in the cytoplasmic domain, which includes the two ATP-binding cassettes and the linker region, or adjacent putative transmembrane domain. Our results confirm that MRP2/cMOAT is the gene responsible for DJS. The finding that mutations are concentrated in the first ATP-binding-cassette domain strongly suggests that a disruption of this region is a critical route to loss of function.",1
15592339,Exercise patterns and cardiovascular fitness of patients with peripheral arterial disease,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is characterized by walking impairment as the result of claudication, which is improved by exercise. Few studies have examined the impact of existing exercise patterns in community-dwelling patients with PAD on cardiovascular fitness and absolute claudication distance (ACD). This descriptive study examines exercise patterns, walking distance, and cardiovascular fitness in a sample of community-dwelling older adults with PAD. Approximately 50% of subjects reported walking 4 (+/-2) days per week for 38 +/- 24 minutes. ACD (exercisers = 459.9 +/- 272; non-exercisers = 351.2 +/- 266.3, P = .06) and initial claudication distance (exercisers = 198.5 +/- 139.7; non-exercisers = 138.7 +/- 95.8 P = .02) were similar between groups. The workload accomplished was approximately 4.1-4.7 metabolic equivalents. Resting heart rate (HR) was associated with initial claudication distance ( r = -.37, P = .001) and ACD ( r = -.46, P < .01) and was lower in the group of exercisers versus the non-exercisers ( P = .05). Mean resting SBP was elevated and continued to increase at peak exercise with no difference between groups ( P = .75). Quality of life was poor for both groups. Simultaneous multiple regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of peak exercise HR. The model included gender, age, current exercise, ankle-brachial index, coronary artery disease, beta blockers, ACD, and atrial fibrillation (R = 44%, P = .01). Higher peak exercise HR was associated with older age, female gender, no beta blockers, and greater ACD ( P < .01). The findings from this descriptive study demonstrate the need for larger long-term studies to address issues of exercise adherence and the psychologic and functional benefits of exercise.",0
15070940,Hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome in Roma families from Portugal is due to a founder mutation of the HRPT2 gene,"The hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the occurrence of parathyroid tumors and ossifying jaw fibromas. The gene causing HPT-JT, HRPT2, is located on chromosome 1q31.2 and consists of 17 exons that encode a 531-amino acid protein, designated parafibromin. We recently identified six Roma families in Portugal with 56 members (11 affected and 45 asymptomatic), who had the HPT-JT syndrome. We postulated that they may have a common ancestor and that the HPT-JT syndrome may be due to a mutation of the HRPT2 gene. Haplotype analysis using 14 chromosome 1q24-q32 polymorphic markers showed that the 11 affected individuals shared a common haplotype defined by seven markers that spanned an approximately 12.5-cM region, flanked centromerically by D1S202 and telomerically by D1S306. DNA sequence analysis identified a 2-bp (TG or GT) frameshift deletion in exon 8, which predicts a truncated parafibromin protein, in all 11 affected individuals. This mutation was also found in 19 unaffected individuals (age range, 12-74 yr) who shared the affected haplotype, suggesting a low age-related penetrance for HPT-JT in these families. Thus, the HPT-JT syndrome in six Roma families from Portugal is due to a novel founder mutation in the HRPT2 gene.",1
9126485,Identification of a new human catenin gene family member (ARVCF) from the region deleted in velo-cardio-facial syndrome,"Velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) and DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) are characterized by a wide spectrum of phenotypes, including conotruncal heart defects, cleft palate, and facial dysmorphology. Hemizygosity for a portion of chromosome 22q11 has been detected in 80-85% of VCFS/DGS patients. Both syndromes are thought to be the result of a developmental field defect. Using two independent gene-isolation procedures, we isolated a new catenin family member termed ARVCF (armadillo repeat gene deleted in VCFS) from the interval deleted in VCFS. ARVCF encodes a protein of 962 amino acids that contains a coiled coil domain and 10 tandem armadillo repeats. The primary structure of the protein is most closely related to the murine catenin p120CAS, which suggests a role for ARVCF in protein-protein interactions at adherens junctions. ARVCF is expressed ubiquitously in all fetal and adult tissues examined. This gene is hemizygous in all VCFS patients with interstitial deletions. Based on the physical location and potential functions of ARVCF, we suggest that hemizygosity at this locus may play a role in the etiology of some of the phenotypes associated with VCFS.",1
22100672,ABC's of bioabsorption: application of lactide based polymers in fully resorbable cardiovascular stents,"Lactide based polymers present a promising class of materials for successful development of fully resorbable stents, thus helping to bring the concept of vascular restoration therapies to life. Not only can these polymers be perfectly tuned to fulfil technical requirements for a fully resorbable stent, they have been proven to be safe materials with a long track record of in vivo biocompatibility in a broad range of medical and pharmaceutical fields. They have a strong regulatory history as well. The polymers degrade through hydrolysis, and are eliminated by the human body through natural pathways via the Krebs cycle. The polymers can perform a temporary mechanical function, allowing the tissue to heal and resume its original function before the implant looses its mechanical integrity. The mechanical performance of the stent can be achieved through stent design and manufacturing methods, as well as tailoring the properties of the polymer itself. The resorption time of cardiovascular stents based on these polymers can be tuned -from a polymer perspective- by tailoring the molecular weight, the crystallinity and the hydrophilicity of the polymer. Drug eluting coatings for resorbable stents can be developed from the same family of polymers, tailoring the composition to the desired controlled release of the applicable drug. To successfully develop resorbable cardiovascular devices an interdisciplinary approach is needed, bringing together polymer chemists and engineers and connecting them with medical device and clinical experts.",0
25128443,Prostate pointers and pitfalls: the 10 most prevalent problems in prostate biopsy interpretation,"As small volumes of prostate cancer are being detected with ever-increasing frequency, the pathologist is challenged to make more diagnostically out of less. This photoessay explores ten diagnostic problems that are noted with regularity by a provider of second opinions in prostate biopsy interpretation. These include: suboptimal submission of prostate cores, atypia with small size of the focus of concern, cytologic ambiguity of the focus of concern, issues with ordering and interpreting immunostains, atypia arising with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, benign mimics of cancer, omitting mention of extraprostatic tumor extension or of Gleason pattern 5, not recognizing intraductal carcinoma, and the differential diagnosis of cancer of urothelial versus prostatic origin.

The goal is to determine the time in which there is maximal contrast uptake (a surrogate for permeability) in the tumor relative to healthy tissue. A notable feature of the data is its spatial heterogeneity. Zhang, Johnson, Little, and Cao (2008a and 2008b) discuss two parallel approaches to ",0
3090824,The diagnostic usefulness of measuring antineutrophil antibodies in neutropenic patients,"We prospectively evaluated the usefulness of measuring antineutrophil (PMN) antibodies in patients with neutropenia by a sensitive immunoassay. The result of the immunoassay were compared to a standard leukoagglutination test. Thirty-two patients with neutropenia were studied. The mean value (+/- 1 SD) for PMN-bound IgG for 43 normal controls was 121 +/- 29 fg/PHN. All fifteen patients with immune neutropenia had elevated plasma levels of anti-PMN antibody (191-2,000 fg/PMN). The leukoagglutination assay was positive in 10 of these 15 patients. In 17 patients with nonimmune neutropenia, the mean value (+/- 1 SD) for PMN-bound IgG was 120 +/- 22 fg. Seventeen patients with sero-positive rheumatoid arthritis but normal PMN counts were also studied. These patients' plasmas bound 447 +/- (1 SD) 201 fg IgG/PMN. The leukoagglutination test was negative in these patients. Our study shows that the immunoassay is more sensitive than leukoagglutination testing for diagnosing immune neutropenia. Nonimmune, neutropenic patients' plasmas showed no increased reactivity. In nonneutropenic patients who have high titers of rheumatoid factor, immunoreactivity against PMN is measured by the immunoassay, but not by leukoagglutination testing. Binding assays may be more sensitive than leukoagglutination testing for measuring anti-PMN antibodies; however, in some cases, specificity of such testing may be increased with leukoagglutination testing.",0

25574247,Clinical and morphological aspects of gray matter heterotopia type developmental malformations,"BACKGROUND: Gray matter heterotopia (GMH) is a malformation of the central nervous system characterized by interruption of normal neuroblasts migration between the 7(th) and 16(th) week of fetal development. The aim of the study was the analysis of clinical symptoms, prevalence rate and the most common concurrent central nervous system (CNS) developmental disorders as well as assessment of characteristic morphological changes of gray matter heterotopia in children hospitalized in our institution between the year 2001 and 2012. MATERIAL/METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients' data who were hospitalized in our institution between the year 2001 and 2012. We assessed clinical data and imaging exams in children diagnosed with gray matter heterotopia confirmed in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). RESULTS: GMH occurred in 26 children hospitalized in our institution between the year 2001 and 2012. Among children with gray matter heterotopia most common clinical symptoms were: epilepsy, intellectual disability and hemiparesis. The commonest location of heterotopic gray matter were fronto-parietal areas of brain parenchyma, mostly subependymal region. Gray matter heterotopia occurred with other developmental disorders of the central nervous system rather than solely and in most cases it was bilateral. Schizencephaly and abnormalities of the corpus callosum were the most often developmental disorders accompanying GMH. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Subependymal gray matter heterotopia was more common than subcortical GMH. Subependymal GMH showed tendency to localize in the region of the bodies of the lateral ventricles. The least common was laminar GMH. 2. Gray matter heterotopia occurred more often with other developmental disorders of the central nervous system rather than solely. The most frequent concurrent disorders of the central nervous system were: schizencephaly, developmental abnormalities of the corpus callosum, arachnoid cyst, abnormalities of the septum pellucidum and the fornix. 3. GMH foci were more often bilateral than unilateral. 4. In the diagnostics of cell migration abnormalities, gray matter heterotopia included, MR imaging remains the method of choice.",0
24896277,"Injuries caused by venomous animals and folk medicine in farmers from Cuite, State of Paraiba, Northeast of Brazil","Injuries caused by venomous animals reported by the agricultural workers from the municipality of Cuite, Curimatau region of Paraiba State, Northeast of Brazil, and the practices of folk medicine which they use to treat these cases were studied in this work from June to August 2010. The farmers studied aged from 11 to 90 years. The number of people who reported cases of injury by these animals in their families was high (89.3%). Scorpions, wasps, bees and snakes were the most cited and the extremities of the body (hands, feet, legs and head) were the most affected. The practice of folk medicine to treat these injuries includes various procedures ranging from ritualistic treatments, use of animals or parts of them, and some herbal preparations. The folk treatment was reported as effective by most of the workers injured (63.9%). Body parts of dead snakes are used in various zootherapic treatments. In the imaginary of the agricultural workers the venomous animals are considered hazardous (48.7%) or disgusting (11.3%), and several parts of such animals as the rattle, bee sting or snake leather are used as amulet. Several legends have also been reported about snakes, scorpions and bees. The need for educational activities that aim to clarify these workers about the dangers of such practices is urgent. ",0
8845852,Mapping of a second locus for lamellar ichthyosis to chromosome 2q33-35,"Lamellar ichthyosis (LI) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of cornification. It was recently demonstrated to result from deleterious mutations in the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. However, the disease was shown to be genetically heterogeneous, since some families were found to be unlinked to TGM1. Homozygosity mapping on three consanguinous families originating from Morocco shows (i) absence of linkage with TGM1 and other regions of the genome containing genes involved in cornification, and (ii) location of a second disease-causing gene on chromosome 2q33-35. A maximum two-point lodscore of 7.60 was obtained with D2S157 for theta = 0. The analysis of recombination events places the gene within a 7-8 cM interval. Additional consanguinous pedigrees were also demonstrated to be unlinked both to TGM1 and to 2q33-35, suggesting the existence of at least a third disease-causing gene.",1
11586351,Mutations in a member of the ADAMTS gene family cause thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening systemic illness of abrupt onset and unknown cause. Proteolysis of the blood-clotting protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) observed in normal plasma is decreased in TTP patients. However, the identity of the responsible protease and its role in the pathophysiology of TTP remain unknown. We performed genome-wide linkage analysis in four pedigrees of humans with congenital TTP and mapped the responsible genetic locus to chromosome 9q34. A predicted gene in the identified interval corresponds to a segment of a much larger transcript, identifying a new member of the ADAMTS family of zinc metalloproteinase genes (ADAMTS13). Analysis of patients' genomic DNA identified 12 mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene, accounting for 14 of the 15 disease alleles studied. We show that deficiency of ADAMTS13 is the molecular mechanism responsible for TTP, and suggest that physiologic proteolysis of VWF and/or other ADAMTS13 substrates is required for normal vascular homeostasis.",1
14508385,Twelve-month evaluation of the clinical pharmacokinetics of total and free mycophenolic acid and its glucuronide metabolites in renal allograft recipients on low dose tacrolimus in combination with mycophenolate mofetil,"BACKGROUND: The establishment of a rationale for therapeutic drug monitoring for mycophenolic acid (MPA) and outlining a therapeutic window remains a challenging task in renal transplantation. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of free and total MPA and its glucuronides depend directly or indirectly on graft function and the type of co-administered calcineurin-inhibitor. METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective 12-month multicenter pharmacokinetic study on MPA (MPA, free MPA, free fraction MPA) and its metabolites (MPAG, Acyl-MPAG). The aim of this study was to examine the long-term pharmacokinetic characteristics of MMF when combined with tacrolimus in renal allograft recipients and to identify a possible relationship between these pharmacokinetic parameters and clinical outcome parameters. RESULTS: They have demonstrated that in renal transplant recipients MPA, free MPA, Acyl-MPAG and MPAG have a particular pharmacokinetic profile when combined with tacrolimus which differs from the combination with CsA. They could not establish a relationship between pre-dose trough concentration of MPA and its metabolites and clinical efficacy endpoints and drug-related adverse events, except for anemia. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that trough plasma concentration monitoring of MPA and its metabolites might not provide a useful clinical tool for guiding MMF dose adjustments to avoid drug-related toxicity. More extensive pharmacokinetic measurements like area under the concentration curves might be necessary for routine therapeutic drug monitoring of MMF.",0
11821380,"Plunc, a member of the secretory gland protein family, is up-regulated in nasal respiratory epithelium after olfactory bulbectomy","Subtraction suppression hybridization was used with high throughput screening to identify transcripts of genes that are differentially expressed in nasal epithelium following lesioning of the olfactory bulb, termed bulbectomy. We isolated the rat homologue of plunc, a murine gene highly expressed in lung and nasopharyngeal regions, by this method. Rat plunc encodes a 270-amino acid protein containing a putative signal peptide. plunc up-regulation in respiratory epithelium was confirmed by Northern blot and in situ hybridization. plunc mRNA was expressed in nasal epithelium, heart, lung, thymus, and salivary gland in adult rodent. plunc was expressed in nasal epithelium, thymus, and salivary gland during embryogenesis. Antibodies against Plunc detected a 31-kDa protein in lung, heart, and spleen. Rat nasal epithelium displayed robust immunoreactivity that was highly localized to the microvilli layer of respiratory epithelium. The expression of plunc was up-regulated after bulbectomy in respiratory epithelium. We also detected secreted plunc in rat and human mucus. Sequence and homology analyses suggest that Plunc is a member of the secretory gland protein family with putative bactericidal/bacteriostatic function. This is the first protein found in respiratory epithelium whose expression is regulated by olfactory neuronal injury and may provide protection against infection subsequent to injury.",1

22243044,Impact of transdermal drug delivery on treatment adherence in patients with Alzheimer's disease,"OBJECTIVE: As a part of a study investigating which strategies are effective to improve pharmacological compliance among nonadherent Alzheimer's disease patients, we assessed the impact of the galenic form (oral medications or patches) on treatment adherence in patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT). DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a 6-month prospective, multicenter, observational study with three study visits (baseline, 3 months and 6 months). Patients with mild-to-moderately severe DAT receiving medication for >/=3 months who were nonadherent to treatment were recruited. OUTCOME MEASURES: The main variable was adherence rate recorded at each visit. Patients were adherent if they missed <20% of the doses of their medication and they took it at the dose, manner and timing prescribed by the physician >80% of times. Secondary variables included strategies followed by physicians to improve adherence and reasons for nonadherence reported by patients. RESULTS: A total of 649 patients (35.2% men) were included. The percentage of adherent patients reached 73.6% at 3 months and rose to 85.9% at 6 months. The most common reasons for nonadherence were forgetfulness, avoidance of adverse events and refusal of treatment. Modification of treatment was the most frequent strategy followed by physicians for improving treatment adherence at baseline, and the only intervention that substantially improved adherence at the 3-month visit (the percentage of patients treated with patches increased from 6.1% at baseline to 64.8% at 3-month visit). Patients using patches were more likely to comply than patients using capsules/tablets, as demonstrated by logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that the transdermal patch may improve adherence, which may lead to an increase of treatment benefits in patients with DAT.",0
1941989,The production and activity in vivo of Proteus mirabilis IgA protease in infections of the urinary tract,Immunoblotting of urine from 21 patients of both sexes and of wide age range who had a Proteus mirabilis urinary tract infection (UTI) showed that 14 (64%) specimens contained immunoglobulin A (IgA). In nine (64%) of these the IgA heavy chain had been degraded to fragments of a size identical to those formed when purified IgA was degraded by pure P. mirabilis protease. Urine from patients with clinical evidence of upper UTI contained fragmented IgA and in some of these urine samples P. mirabilis protease activity was detectable. Urine infected with a non-proteolytic strain contained only intact IgA. It is concluded that P. mirabilis IgA protease is produced and is active during infections of the urinary tract.,0
2442326,Localization of sodium channel subtypes in adult rat skeletal muscle using channel-specific monoclonal antibodies,"Five monoclonal antibodies specific for the 260 kDa subunit of the rat skeletal muscle sodium channel were used to probe the distribution of this channel in adult muscle. All the antibodies reacted with the surface membrane of fast- and slow-twitch fibers in the rat anterior tibial and soleus muscles. Immunoreactivity was also present in the endplate region; this was significantly more intense than that in the surrounding extrajunctional membrane. At the electron microscopic level, this junctional immunoreactivity could be traced uniformly throughout the secondary folds of the post-synaptic membrane. Three of the monoclonal antibodies (A/B2, F/E4, and I/E3) exhibited an additional distinct immunoreactivity pattern, staining the interior of selected fibers in the anterior tibial muscle that were subsequently identified as slow-twitch fibers. An identical reactivity pattern was observed with most of the soleus muscle fibers. In longitudinal sections of slow fibers examined at the light microscopic level, transversely oriented, regularly spaced doublets of fluorescence were localized at the junction of the A and I bands in each sarcomere. In permeabilized slow fibers exposed to A/B2 and examined at the electron microscopic level, internal reactivity was associated exclusively with the membranes of the T-tubular system. A/B2 also strongly stained a transversely oriented pattern within cardiac muscle fibers exhibiting the characteristics of the T-tubular system in that tissue. We conclude that at least 3 subpopulations of sodium channels are present in adult skeletal muscle: those in the sarcolemma of fast and slow fibers, those in slow-twitch fiber T-tubular membranes, and those in the T-tubular system of fast fibers. The channels in the slow fiber T-system apparently share common epitopes with those in the T-system of cardiac fibers.",0

12782671,Mice deficient in alpha-actinin-4 have severe glomerular disease,"Dominantly inherited mutations in ACTN4, which encodes alpha-actinin-4, cause a form of human focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). By homologous recombination in ES cells, we developed a mouse model deficient in Actn4. Mice homozygous for the targeted allele have no detectable alpha-actinin-4 protein expression. The number of homozygous mice observed was lower than expected under mendelian inheritance. Surviving mice homozygous for the targeted allele show progressive proteinuria, glomerular disease, and typically death by several months of age. Light microscopic analysis shows extensive glomerular disease and proteinaceous casts. Electron microscopic examination shows focal areas of podocyte foot-process effacement in young mice, and diffuse effacement and globally disrupted podocyte morphology in older mice. Despite the widespread distribution of alpha-actinin-4, histologic examination of mice showed abnormalities only in the kidneys. In contrast to the dominantly inherited human form of ACTN4-associated FSGS, here we show that the absence of alpha-actinin-4 causes a recessive form of disease in mice. Cell motility, as measured by lymphocyte chemotaxis assays, was increased in the absence of alpha-actinin-4. We conclude that alpha-actinin-4 is required for normal glomerular function. We further conclude that the nonsarcomeric forms of alpha-actinin (alpha-actinin-1 and alpha-actinin-4) are not functionally redundant. In addition, these genetic studies demonstrate that the nonsarcomeric alpha-actinin-4 is involved in the regulation of cell movement.",1
22521416,A truncating mutation of CEP135 causes primary microcephaly and disturbed centrosomal function,"Autosomal-recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by intellectual disability, reduced brain and head size, but usually without defects in cerebral cortical architecture, and other syndromic abnormalities. MCPH is heterogeneous. The underlying genes of the seven known loci code for centrosomal proteins. We studied a family from northern Pakistan with two microcephalic children using homozygosity mapping and found suggestive linkage for regions on chromosomes 2, 4, and 9. We sequenced two positional candidate genes and identified a homozygous frameshift mutation in the gene encoding the 135 kDa centrosomal protein (CEP135), located in the linkage interval on chromosome 4, in both affected children. Post hoc whole-exome sequencing corroborated this mutation's identification as the causal variant. Fibroblasts obtained from one of the patients showed multiple and fragmented centrosomes, disorganized microtubules, and reduced growth rate. Similar effects were reported after knockdown of CEP135 through RNA interference; we could provoke them also by ectopic overexpression of the mutant protein. Our findings suggest an additional locus for MCPH at HSA 4q12 (MCPH8), further strengthen the role of centrosomes in the development of MCPH, and place CEP135 among the essential components of this important organelle in particular for a normal neurogenesis.",1

We report a case of unilateral fluctuant sensorineural hearing loss with tinnitus after a series of hepatitis B vaccinations. Tinnitus regressed and hearing thresholds were normalized 6 months later. The authors discuss the potential causality of hepatitis B vaccine in the occurrence of fluctuant sensorineural hearing loss and propose a physiopathological hypothesis to explain this unusual case.,0
27663155,Two patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIII with unexpected hoarseness,"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) encompasses a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders, characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility and tissue fragility. It is a rare condition, and inheritance is either autosomal dominant or recessive. Previously grouped into 11 different subtypes, with increasing knowledge of the underlying molecular defects, it was reclassified in 1997 into 6 major groups, with type VIII excluded from this classification. Type VIII EDS is a very rare subtype, characterized by severe, early-onset periodontitis, skin fragility and abnormal scarring. Voice abnormalities have occasionally been described in other forms of the condition, and may be due to defects in the collagen of the vocal ligament. We report two cases of patients with EDS type VIII and hoarseness. ",1
21332761,Enhanced activity of antifungal drugs using natural phenolics against yeast strains of Candida and Cryptococcus,"AIMS: Determine whether certain, natural phenolic compounds enhance activity of commercial antifungal drugs against yeast strains of Candida and Cryptococcus neoformans. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve natural phenolics were examined for fungicidal activity against nine reference strains of Candida and one of C. neoformans. Six compounds were selected for synergistic enhancement of antifungal drugs, amphotericin B (AMB), fluconazole (FLU) and itraconazole (ITR). Matrix assays of phenolic and drug combinations conducted against one reference strain, each, of Candida albicans and C. neoformans showed cinnamic and benzoic acids, thymol, and 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehydes (-DBA) had synergistic interactions depending upon drug and yeast strain. 2,5-DBA was synergistic with almost all drug and strain combinations. Thymol was synergistic with all drugs against Ca. albicans and with AMB in C. neoformans. Combinations of benzoic acid or thymol with ITR showed highest synergistic activity. Of 36 combinations of natural product and drug tested, none were antagonistic. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively nontoxic natural products can synergistically enhance antifungal drug activity, in vitro. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is a proof-of-concept, having clinical implications. Natural chemosensitizing agents could lower dosages needed for effective chemotherapy of invasive mycoses. Further studies against clinical yeast strains and use of animal models are warranted.",0
18161984,Intermolecular hydroaminations via strained (E)-cycloalkenes,"A photoinduced procedure for the intermolecular hydroamination of alkenes using azoles is described. This reaction occurs in modest to good yield for 6- and 7-membered cyclic alkenes. Upon irradiation at 254 nm in the presence of methyl benzoate and a small amount of triflic acid as an additive (20 mol %), imidazoles, pyrazoles, triazoles, and tetrazole can react with the alkene to afford complex Markovnikov adducts. The proposed mechanism involves photoisomerization to generate highly strained (E)-cycloalkene intermediates and (E)-cycloalkene protonation followed by reaction with the azole nucleophile. Alkene isomerization was found to be a competing side reaction under these conditions.",0
25185265,UBAP2L is a novel BMI1-interacting protein essential for hematopoietic stem cell activity,"Multipotent long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) can self-renew or differentiate into the less primitive short-term repopulating stem cells (ST-HSCs), which themselves produce progenitors that ensure the daily supply of all essential blood components. The Polycomb group (PcG) protein BMI1 is essential for the activity of both HSCs and progenitor cells. Although BMI1 operates by suppressing the Ink4a/Arf locus in progenitors and ST-HSCs, the mechanisms through which this gene regulates the activity of LT-HSCs remain poorly understood. Toward this goal, we isolated BMI1-containing protein complexes and identified UBAP2L as a novel BMI1-interacting protein. We also showed that UBAP2L is preferentially expressed in mouse and human HSC-enriched populations when compared with more mature cell types, and that this gene is essential for the activity of LT-HSCs. In contrast to what is observed for Bmi1 knockdown, we found that UBAP2L depletion does not affect the Ink4a/Arf locus. Given that we demonstrated that BMI1 overexpression is able to rescue the deleterious effects of Ubap2l downregulation on LT-HSC activity and that UBAP2L is part of a PcG subcomplex comprising BMI1, we propose a model in which at least 2 different BMI1-containing PcG complexes regulate HSC activity, which are distinguishable by the presence of UBAP2L.

24124559,A novel large in-frame deletion within the CACNA1F gene associates with a cone-rod dystrophy 3-like phenotype,"Cone-rod dystrophies (CORDs) represent a heterogeneous group of monogenic diseases leading to early impairment of vision. The majority of CORD entities show autosomal modes of inheritance and X-linked traits are comparably rare. So far, three X-chromosomal entities were reported (CORDX1, -X2 and -X3). In this study, we analysed a large family of German origin with solely affected males over three generations showing a CORDX-like phenotype. Due to the heterogeneity of cone-rod dystrophies, we performed a combined linkage and X-exome sequencing approach and identified a novel large intragenic in-frame deletion encompassing exons 18 to 26 within the CACNA1F gene. CACNA1F is described causative for CORDX3 in a single family originating from Finland and alterations in this gene have not yet been reported in other CORDX pedigrees. Our data independently confirm CACNA1F as the causative gene for CORDX3-like phenotypes and detailed clinical characterization of the family expands the knowledge about the phenotypic spectrum of deleterious CACNA1F alterations.

22840528,Spectrum and prevalence of mutations involving BrS1- through BrS12-susceptibility genes in a cohort of unrelated patients referred for Brugada syndrome genetic testing: implications for genetic testing,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to provide the spectrum and prevalence of mutations in the 12 Brugada syndrome (BrS)-susceptibility genes discovered to date in a single large cohort of unrelated BrS patients. BACKGROUND: BrS is a potentially lethal heritable arrhythmia syndrome diagnosed electrocardiographically by coved-type ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads (V1 to V3; type 1 Brugada electrocardiographic [ECG] pattern) and the presence of a personal/family history of cardiac events. METHODS: Using polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and DNA sequencing, comprehensive mutational analysis of BrS1- through BrS12-susceptibility genes was performed in 129 unrelated patients with possible/probable BrS (46 with clinically diagnosed BrS [ECG pattern plus personal/family history of a cardiac event] and 83 with a type 1 BrS ECG pattern only). RESULTS: Overall, 27 patients (21%) had a putative pathogenic mutation, absent in 1,400 Caucasian reference alleles, including 21 patients with an SCN5A mutation, 2 with a CACNB2B mutation, and 1 each with a KCNJ8 mutation, a KCND3 mutation, an SCN1Bb mutation, and an HCN4 mutation. The overall mutation yield was 23% in the type 1 BrS ECG pattern-only patients versus 17% in the clinically diagnosed BrS patients and was significantly greater among young men<20 years of age with clinically diagnosed BrS and among patients who had a prolonged PQ interval. CONCLUSIONS: We identified putative pathogenic mutations in  approximately 20% of our BrS cohort, with BrS genes 2 through 12 accounting for <5%. Importantly, the yield was similar between patients with only a type 1 BrS ECG pattern and those with clinically established BrS. The yield approaches 40% for SCN5A-mediated BrS (BrS1) when the PQ interval exceeds 200 ms. Calcium channel-mediated BrS is extremely unlikely in the absence of a short QT interval.",1
2005078,Efficacy and safety of morning versus evening fluoxetine administration,"A total of 120 patients who met DSM-III criteria for unipolar major depressive episode were equally randomized to fluoxetine a.m. or fluoxetine p.m. treatment groups, such that 30 patients were in each group at each of two sites. Patients received 20 to 80 mg of fluoxetine every day for 5 weeks; the dose was based on clinical response. Highly significant within-treatment improvement was reflected by changes in mean scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (total score and factors), the Raskin Depression Scale, the Covi Anxiety Scale, the Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Severity, and the Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Improvement. No significant differences occurred between the a.m. and p.m. groups for any efficacy variable. Evaluation of adverse events and vital signs indicated no clinically significant differences between the two treatment groups. The data indicate that fluoxetine is equally efficacious and well tolerated regardless of the time of day it is administered and suggest that fluoxetine may be administered at either time of day without affecting clinical course.",0

The patients were randomized to receive oral therapy with oxytetracycline, doxycycline, rifampin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) either alone or in combination with each other or combined with streptomycin or gentamicin injections. The patients were also randomized into three groups based on the duration of oral therapy: 500 patients were treated for 3 weeks; 350 for 5 weeks; and 250 for 8 weeks. When intramuscular aminoglycosides were used, streptomycin was given for 2 weeks and gentamicin for 5 days. In oral monotherapy oxytetracycline, doxycycline and rifampin showed comparable results with low relapse rates (less than or equal to 9%) and no statistically significant differences were found among 3-, 5- or 8-week durations of therapy. TMP/SMX alone showed an unacceptably high relapse rate (30%) with all durations of therapy. In combined oral therapy rifampin plus oxytetracycline, rifampin plus TMP/SMX and oxytetracycline plus TMP/SMX showed comparable results with low relapse rates ranging from 4 to 8% in patients receiving therapy for 3 or 5 weeks, no relapses occurred in patients treated for 8 weeks. When oral monotherapy was combined with either streptomycin or gentamicin, very few relapses were seen, irrespective of the duration of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
16702421,Developmental modulation of nonhomologous end joining in Caenorhabditis elegans,"Homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) are important DNA double-strand break repair pathways in many organisms. C. elegans strains harboring mutations in the cku-70, cku-80, or lig-4 NHEJ genes displayed multiple developmental abnormalities in response to radiation-induced DNA damage in noncycling somatic cells. These phenotypes did not result from S-phase, DNA damage, or mitotic checkpoints, apoptosis, or stress response pathways that regulate dauer formation. However, an additional defect in him-10, a kinetochore component, synergized with NHEJ mutations for the radiation-induced developmental phenotypes, suggesting that they may be triggered by mis-segregation of chromosome fragments. Although NHEJ was an important DNA repair pathway for noncycling somatic cells in C. elegans, homologous recombination was used to repair radiation-induced DNA damage in cycling somatic cells and in germ cells at all times. Noncycling germ cells that depended on homologous recombination underwent cell cycle arrest in G2, whereas noncycling somatic cells that depended on NHEJ arrested in G1, suggesting that cell cycle phase may modulate DNA repair during development. We conclude that error-prone NHEJ plays little or no role in DNA repair in C. elegans germ cells, possibly ensuring homology-based double-strand break repair and transmission of a stable genome from one generation to the next.",0
11201048,Detection of a novel mutation in X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta,"Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders of defective enamel formation. The major protein involved in enamel formation, amelogenin, is encoded by a gene located at Xp22.1-Xp22.3. This study investigated the molecular defect producing a combined phenotype of hypoplasia and hypomineralization in a family with the clinical features and inheritance pattern of X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta (XAI). Genomic DNA was prepared from buccal cells sampled from family members. The DNA was subjected to the polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) in the presence of a series of oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify all 7 exons of the amelogenin gene. Cloning and sequencing of the purified amplification products identified a cytosine deletion in exon VI at codon 119. The deletion resulted in a frameshift mutation, introducing a premature stop signal at codon 126, producing a truncated protein lacking the terminal 18 amino acids. Identifying mutations assists our understanding of the important functional domains within the gene, and finding another novel mutation emphasizes the need for family-specific diagnosis of amelogenesis imperfecta.",1
8244370,"Mapping of aldose reductase gene sequences to human chromosomes 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, and 13","Aldose reductase (alditol:NAD(P)+ 1-oxidoreductase; EC 1.1.1.21) (AR) catalyzes the reduction of several aldehydes, including that of glucose, to the corresponding sugar alcohol. Using a complementary DNA clone encoding human AR, we mapped the gene sequences to human chromosomes 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, and 18 by somatic cell hybridization. By in situ hybridization analysis, sequences were localized to human chromosomes 1q32-q42, 3p12, 7q31-q35, 9q22, 11p14-p15, and 13q14-q21. As a putative functional AR gene has been mapped to chromosome 7 and a putative pseudogene to chromosome 3, the sequences on the other seven chromosomes may represent other active genes, non-aldose reductase homologous sequences, or pseudogenes.",1
15150555,Alteration of the copy number and deletion of mitochondrial DNA in human hepatocellular carcinoma,"Somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been detected in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it remains unclear whether mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial biogenesis are altered in HCC. In this study, we found that mtDNA copy number and the content of mitochondrial respiratory proteins were reduced in HCCs as compared with the corresponding non-tumorous livers. MtDNA copy number was significantly reduced in female HCC but not in male HCC. Expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 was significantly repressed in HCCs (P<0.005), while the expression of the mitochondrial single-strand DNA-binding protein was upregulated, indicating that the regulation of mitochondria biogenesis is disturbed in HCC. Moreover, 22% of HCCs carried a somatic mutation in the mtDNA D-loop region. The non-tumorous liver of the HCC patients with a long-term alcohol-drinking history contained reduced mtDNA copy number (P<0.05) and higher level of the 4977 bp-deleted mtDNA (P<0.05) as compared with non-alcohol patients. Our results suggest that reduced mtDNA copy number, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and somatic mutations in mtDNA are important events during carcinogenesis of HCC, and the differential alterations in mtDNA of male and female HCC may contribute to the differences in the clinical manifestation between female and male HCC patients.",0
15630442,A protective role for the A1 adenosine receptor in adenosine-dependent pulmonary injury,"Adenosine is a signaling nucleoside that has been implicated in the regulation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Adenosine signaling can serve both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions in tissues and cells. In this study we examined the contribution of A(1) adenosine receptor (A(1)AR) signaling to the pulmonary inflammation and injury seen in adenosine deaminase-deficient (ADA-deficient) mice, which exhibit elevated adenosine levels. Experiments revealed that transcript levels for the A(1)AR were elevated in the lungs of ADA-deficient mice, in which expression was localized predominantly to alveolar macrophages. Genetic removal of the A(1)AR from ADA-deficient mice resulted in enhanced pulmonary inflammation along with increased mucus metaplasia and alveolar destruction. These changes were associated with the exaggerated expression of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 in the lungs, together with increased expression of chemokines and matrix metalloproteinases. These findings demonstrate that the A(1)AR plays an anti-inflammatory and/or protective role in the pulmonary phenotype seen in ADA-deficient mice, which suggests that A(1)AR signaling may serve to regulate the severity of pulmonary inflammation and remodeling seen in chronic lung diseases by controlling the levels of important mediators of pulmonary inflammation and damage.",1
27385493,Metallic implant geometry and susceptibility estimation using multispectral B0 field maps,"PURPOSE: To estimate the susceptibility and the geometry of metallic implants from multispectral imaging (MSI) information, to separate the metal implant region from the surrounding signal loss region. THEORY AND METHODS: The susceptibility map of signal-void regions is estimated from MSI B0 field maps using total variation (TV) regularized inversion. Voxels with susceptibility estimates above a predetermined threshold are identified as metal. The accuracy of the estimated susceptibility and implant geometry was evaluated in simulations, phantom, and in vivo experiments. RESULTS: The proposed method provided more accurate susceptibility estimation compared with a previous method without TV regularization, in both simulations and phantom experiments. In the phantom experiment where the actual implant was 40% of the signal-void region, the mean estimated susceptibility was close to the susceptibility in literature, and the precision and recall of the estimated geometry was 85% and 93%. In vivo studies in subjects with hip implants also demonstrated that the proposed method can distinguish implants from surrounding low-signal tissues, such as cortical bone. CONCLUSION: The proposed method can improve the delineation of metallic implant geometry by distinguishing metal voxels from artificial signal voids and low-signal tissues by estimating the susceptibility maps.

10914684,Multi-allelic origin of congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG)-Ic,"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), formerly known as carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome, represent a family of genetic diseases with variable clinical presentations. Common to all types of CDG characterized to date is a defective Asn-linked glycosylation caused by enzymatic defects of N-glycan synthesis. Previously, we have identified a mutation in the ALG6 alpha1,3 glucosyltransferase gene as the cause of CDG-Ic in four related patients. Here, we present the identification of seven additional cases of CDG-Ic among a group of 35 untyped CDG patients. Analysis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides in fibroblasts confirmed the accumulation of dolichyl pyrophosphate-Man9GlcNAc2 in the CDG-Ic patients. The genomic organization of the human ALG6 gene was determined, revealing 14 exons spread over 55 kb. By polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of ALG6 exons, three mutations, in addition to the previously described A333 V substitution, were detected in CDG-Ic patients. The detrimental effect of these mutations on ALG6 activity was confirmed by complementation of alg6 yeast mutants. Haplotype analysis of CDG-Ic patients revealed a founder effect for the ALG6 allele bearing the A333 V mutation. Although more than 80% of CDG are type Ia, CDG-Ic may be the second most common form of the disease.",1
11980720,WSTF-ISWI chromatin remodeling complex targets heterochromatic replication foci,"The Williams Syndrome Transcription Factor (WSTF), the product of the WBSCR9 gene, is invariably deleted in the haploinsufficiency Williams-Beuren Syndrome. Along with the nucleosome-dependent ATPase ISWI, WSTF forms a novel chromatin remodeling complex, WICH (WSTF-ISWI chromatin remodeling complex), which is conserved in vertebrates. The WICH complex was purified to homogeneity from Xenopus egg extract and was found to contain only WSTF and ISWI. In mouse cells, WSTF interacts with the SNF2H isoform of ISWI. WSTF accumulates in pericentric heterochromatin coincident with the replication of these structures, suggesting a role for WSTF in the replication of heterochromatin. Such a role is supported by the in vitro activity of both the mouse and frog WICH complexes: they are involved in the assembly of regular spaced nucleosomal arrays. In contrast to the related ISWI-interacting protein ACF1/WCRF180, WSTF binds stably to mitotic chromosomes. As dysfunction of other chromatin remodeling factors often has severe effects on development, haploinsufficiency of WSTF may explain some of the phenotypes associated with this disease.",1
31464067,A systematic review of Toxoplasma gondii genotypes and feline: Geographical distribution trends,"Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is well known for its ability to virtually infect all warm-blooded vertebrates. Although felines as the definitive hosts have an important role in the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis, there are few descriptions of genetic diversity in the world. The present review study aimed to describe the population structure of T. gondii in these animal species. For the purpose of the study, five English language databases reporting data on T. gondii genotyping in cats were searched within March-June 2019. This study is registered on the site of CAMARADES-NC3Rs (15-Jan-2018). The searching process resulted in the inclusion of 50 reports published from 1992 to June 2019. The data revealed that 47,390 samples were genotyped into 662 T. gondii DNA/isolates. Globally, atypical genotypes were predominant (47.7%, n = 316); in addition, Type II clonal strains were the second most common genotype (37%, n = 244). These results suggested an epidemic population structure in America and Asia, and a clonal population structure in Europe and Africa. Genotype #3 was found to be dominant in Africa, Europe and Oceania continents. Furthermore, genotypes #9 and #5 were prevalent in Asia and America, respectively. Additionally, genotypes #2, #3, #5 and #20 were common genotypes in domestic and sylvatic cycles from family Felidae. Collectively, this systematic review indicated a large degree of genetic diversity and circulation of mouse-virulent T. gondii strains in this family. However, further studies are necessary to better understand the population structure of T. gondii in these animal species and determine the significance of their features.",0
2847529,Familial resemblance of plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme level: the Nancy Study,"Plasma angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity has been measured in a sample of 87 healthy families participating in a study of cardiovascular risk factors. The mean +/- SD levels of plasma ACE were 34.1 +/- 10.7, 30.7 +/- 10.4 and 43.1 +/- 17.2 units/liter in fathers (n = 87), mothers (n = 87) and offspring (n = 169), respectively. Plasma ACE was uncorrelated with age, height, weight, or blood pressure in the parents, but a negative correlation with age was observed in offspring (r = -.32). The age-adjusted familial correlations of plasma ACE were .038, .166, .323 and .303 for spouses, father-offspring, mother-offspring, and siblings, respectively. The results of the genetic analysis suggest that a major gene may affect the interindividual variability of plasma ACE, with different codominant effects in parents and offspring. According to this model, the major gene effect accounts for 4.8, 4.0, and 10.8 units/liter of the overall mean and for 29%, 29% and 75% of the variance of age-adjusted ACE in fathers, mothers, and offspring, respectively. The estimate of the probability of the less frequent allele is .26, and the major gene effect is approximately twice as great in high homozygotes than in heterozygotes and in offspring than in parents. The results of this study demonstrate the occurrence of a familial resemblance of plasma ACE activity in healthy families and suggest that this observation can be explained by the segregation of a major gene.",1
1962799,Classical conditioning of vascular responses in mild hypertensives and normotensives,"Using a discriminative classical conditioning paradigm, this study addresses the question of whether vascular responses are more easily acquired or slower to extinguish in mild hypertensives than in normotensive controls. We subjected 18 mild hypertensives, with a resting systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 141/100 mmHg, and 17 normotensive controls similar in age, with resting systolic/diastolic blood pressure 122/80 mmHg, to a discriminative Pavlovian conditioning paradigm with tones of 8 s duration serving as conditioned stimuli (CS) and a mild electric shock as an unconditioned stimulus (UCS). Digital finger pulse volume (FPV) responses were recorded during an acquisition phase, where CS+, but not CS-, was repeatedly paired with the UCS (12 trials), and an extinction phase where shocks were withheld (12 trials). During the acquisition phase, mild hypertensives displayed greater anticipatory vasoconstrictive responses both to CS+ and CS- compared with normotensive controls. In addition, unconditioned FPV responses were enhanced in mild hypertensives. During the extinction phase, mild hypertensives evidenced increased resistance to extinction since conditioned vasoconstriction was more frequently observed in response to CS+ than to CS- in mild hypertensives only. Thus, vascular dysregulation in mild hypertensives was evident both for unconditioned and conditioned vasoconstriction. Data are compatible both with a centrally determined increased conditionability in mild hypertensive compared with normotensive and with a decreased threshold for peripheral vascular responsiveness among mild hypertensives.",0
10626401,Splanchnic circulation after liver cirrhosis shunting,"In 47 patients during 1985-1997 years period the complex haemodynamical investigations before the operation and in 8-12 months after it were performed: in 24--distal splenorenal shunt was performed and in 23--nonselective portocaval shunt. After performance of shunting operation the volumetric speed of the blood flow had lowered together with pressure in v.porta. After the nonselective shunting performance the significantly more pronounced change of these indexes was noted, comparing with such after the selective anastomosis formation. The portal blood flow lowering had promoted the arterial hepatic blood flow increase, showing compensatory-adaptational reaction, directed for the common hepatic blood flow preservation.",0
27311568,Identification of C12orf4 as a gene for autosomal recessive intellectual disability,"Intellectual disability (ID) is a major health problem in our society. Genetic causes of ID remain unknown because of its vast heterogeneity. Here we report two Finnish families and one Dutch family with affected individuals presenting with mild to moderate ID, neuropsychiatric symptoms and delayed speech development. By utilizing whole exome sequencing (WES), we identified a founder missense variant c.983T>C (p.Leu328Pro) in seven affected individuals from two Finnish consanguineous families and a deletion c.799_1034-429delinsTTATGA (p.Gln267fs) in one affected individual from a consanguineous Dutch family in the C12orf4 gene on chromosome 12. Both the variants co-segregated in the respective families as an autosomal recessive trait. Screening of the p.Leu328Pro variant showed enrichment in the North Eastern sub-isolate of Finland among anonymous local blood donors with a carrier frequency of 1:53, similar to other disease mutations with a founder effect in that region. To date, only one Arab family with a three affected individuals with a frameshift insertion variant in C12orf4 has been reported. In summary, we expand and establish the clinical and mutational spectrum of C12orf4 variants. Our findings implicate C12orf4 as a causative gene for autosomal recessive ID.",1
9875972,Itraconazole oral solution for the treatment of onychomycosis,"The newer antifungal agents are increasingly being used for the treatment of onychomycosis. Tinea unguium is uncommon in children. In young children who are unable or unwilling to swallow capsules, the alternative to itraconazole capsules may be the oral solution. The pharmacokinetics of the itraconazole capsule when it is broken open and the contents sprinkled onto food has not been reported. Two sisters, ages 8 and 11 years, presented with fingernail dystrophy that was confirmed to be onychomycosis due to Trichophyton rubrum and T. soudanense, respectively. The patients were reluctant to swallow capsules and were treated with itraconazole pulse therapy using the oral solution, 3 mg/kg/day. The treatment regimen consisted of two pulses, each 1 week long, with a 3-week period between pulses. Both patients were clinically and mycologically cured with no adverse effects. Itraconazole oral solution (3 mg/kg/day) given as pulse therapy may be a consideration in the treatment of onychomycosis in some children.",0
15096450,Adiponectin specifically increased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 through interleukin-10 expression in human macrophages,"BACKGROUND: Vascular inflammation and subsequent matrix degradation play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. We previously reported that adiponectin, an adipose-specific plasma protein, accumulated to the injured artery and attenuated vascular inflammatory response. Clinically, high plasma adiponectin level was associated with low cardiovascular event rate in patients with chronic renal failure. The present study was designed to elucidate the effects of adiponectin on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in human monocyte-derived macrophages. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human monocyte-derived macrophages were incubated with the physiological concentrations of human recombinant adiponectin for the time indicated. Adiponectin treatment dose-dependently increased TIMP-1 mRNA levels without affecting MMP-9 mRNA levels. Adiponectin also augmented TIMP-1 secretion into the media, whereas MMP-9 secretion and activity were unchanged. Time course experiments indicated that TIMP-1 mRNA levels started to increase at 24 hours of adiponectin treatment and were significantly elevated at 48 hours. Adiponectin significantly increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA expression at the transcriptional level within 6 hours and significantly increased IL-10 protein secretion within 24 hours. Cotreatment of adiponectin with anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody completely abolished adiponectin-induced TIMP-1 mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin selectively increased TIMP-1 expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages through IL-10 induction. This study identified, for the first time, the adiponectin/IL-10 interaction against vascular inflammation.",1
11421143,"Nurse documentation: not done or worse, done the wrong way--Part II","PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To focus on nursing documentation and how it can lead to a malpractice lawsuit. DATA SOURCES: Nursing, non-nursing healthcare and legal journals, case law, and related Internet sources. DATA SYNTHESIS: To avoid liability for inadequate or inaccurate documentation, nurses must be aware of how their documentation can either lead to a malpractice claim or actually decrease their chances of ever being named in a malpractice lawsuit. Malpractice cases often are decided based on documentation. The only viable way to defend against allegations of professional negligence is accurate and complete patient charting or defensive documentation. CONCLUSIONS: By examining case law involving inadequate or inaccurate documentation, nurses will be able to effectively adopt documentation practices or policies to decrease potential litigation. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Educating nurses about the principles of documentation and the importance of implementing risk-reduction practices will help guard against liability and ultimately improve patient care.",0

30358093,Matrices based on lineal and star fumarate-metha/acrylate copolymers for bone tissue engineering: Characterization and biocompatibility studies,"This article presents the preparation of matrices from two new families of fumaric copolymers and the effect of structural differences on their physicochemical and biological behavior. Diisopropyl fumarate (DIPF) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (OEGMA) or N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) were copolymerized by conventional radical and RAFT polymerization to obtain lineal or start architectures, respectively. These copolymers were characterized by spectroscopic (FTIR and (1) H-NMR) and chromatographic methods. The thermal stability was studied by thermal gravimetric analysis, showing some differences in relation to the architecture and chemical nature of copolymers. SEM morphological analysis demonstrated that the surface of the matrices derived from OEGMA exhibited an irregular and rough surface, while DIPF-NIPAM copolymers presented smooth surface with nearly no significant porosity. The matrix obtained of both kinds of copolymers presented no cytotoxicity as it was evaluated using a model of macrophages on culture. Moreover, cell growth was better on the surfaces of the DIPF-NIPAM matrices, suggesting a good interaction with this matrix and its potential application as matrices for tissue engineering.

8931052,Impact of caesarean section on future pregnancy--a review of cohort studies,"Use of Caesarean sections has notably increased in many countries. This article reviews existing cohort type studies to compare subsequent reproduction after Caesarean section with a comparable control group, with exposure at the earliest in the 1960s. Eight studies were found. They suggested that a Caesarean section is a risk factor for lowered fertility, for uncompleted pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy and possibly miscarriage), for complications in the next pregnancy and birth (including placental complications) and for health problems in the next infant. The review was impeded by the lack of relevant research, and all studies to date potentially suffer from selection bias by indication. Trials and other studies on the long-term outcomes of Caesarean sections are needed, especially in populations with a high risk for reproductive problems.",0
19122027,A novel ALS2 splice-site mutation in a Cypriot juvenile-onset primary lateral sclerosis family,"BACKGROUND: Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease that affects the upper motor neurons of the CNS. Juvenile-onset PLS (JPLS) is inherited in an autosomal recessive mode and is also found in sporadic cases. A consanguineous Cypriot family with three affected individuals presenting with JPLS was identified and studied. METHODS: Patients were clinically evaluated and samples were taken from consenting family members. All available family members were genotyped and linkage analysis at marker loci spanning the wider region of the ALS2 gene was performed. Selected exons of the ALS2 gene were sequenced and RNA analysis was performed using available lymphoblastoid cell lines from the proband. RESULTS: All affected individuals presented in the second year of life with progressive upper motor neuron dysfunction, affecting both bulbar and extremity muscles. Severity was variable, with two of the patients remaining ambulatory in the second and fifth decade of life while the third one was never able to walk. A novel ALS2 homozygous c.2980-2A>G mutation at the splice acceptor site of intron 17 was identified and its effect was confirmed at the RNA level. CONCLUSIONS: This novel ALS2 splice-site mutation is causing the loss of exon 18 in the transcript which results in a frameshift after exon 17. This frameshift most probably introduces a stop codon seven amino acids further down the new reading frame (p.993fsX7) and is expected to lead to a premature stop in exon 19 thus leading to a truncated protein after translation.",1
22509993,Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in the ATP6V1B1 gene in patients with renal tubular acidosis and sensorineural hearing loss,"Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is characterized by the inability to excrete acid in the renal collecting ducts resulting in inappropriately alkaline urine and hyperchloremic (normal anion gap) metabolic acidosis in the context of a normal (or near-normal) glomerular filtration rate. Inborn dRTA can be due to autosomal dominant or recessive gene defects. Clinical symptoms vary from mild acidosis, incidental detection of kidney stones or renal tract calcification to severe findings such as failure to thrive, severe metabolic acidosis, and nephrocalcinosis. The majority of patients with recessive dRTA present with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Few cases with abnormal widening of the vestibular aqueduct have been described with dRTA. Mutations in three different genes have been identified, namely SLC4A1, ATP6V1B1, and ATP6V0A4. Patients with mutations in the ATP6V1B1 proton pump subunit develop dRTA and in most of the cases sensorineural hearing loss early in childhood. We present two patients from two different and non-consanguineous families with dRTA and SNHL. Direct sequencing of the ATP6V1B1 gene revealed that one patient harbors two homozygous mutations and the other one is a compound heterozygous. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature describing homozygosity in the same dRTA gene on both alleles.",1
14502278,Beta 1-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms confer differential function and predisposition to heart failure,"Catecholamines stimulate cardiac contractility through beta(1)-adrenergic receptors (beta(1)-ARs), which in humans are polymorphic at amino acid residue 389 (Arg/Gly). We used cardiac-targeted transgenesis in a mouse model to delineate mechanisms accounting for the association of Arg389 with human heart failure phenotypes. Hearts from young Arg389 mice had enhanced receptor function and contractility compared with Gly389 hearts. Older Arg389 mice displayed a phenotypic switch, with decreased beta-agonist signaling to adenylyl cyclase and decreased cardiac contractility compared with Gly 389 hearts. Arg389 hearts had abnormal expression of fetal and hypertrophy genes and calcium-cycling proteins, decreased adenylyl cyclase and G alpha(s) expression, and fibrosis with heart failure This phenotype was recapitulated in homozygous, end-stage, failing human hearts. In addition, hemodynamic responses to beta-receptor blockade were greater in Arg389 mice, and homozygosity for Arg389 was associated with improvement in ventricular function during carvedilol treatment in heart failure patients. Thus the human Arg389 variant predisposes to heart failure by instigating hyperactive signaling programs leading to depressed receptor coupling and ventricular dysfunction, and influences the therapeutic response to beta-receptor blockade.",1

We demonstrate that this quantitative function is superior to the widely used modularity Q and also prove its equivalence with the objective function of the kernel k means. Both theoretical and numerical results show that optimizing the new criterion not only can resolve detailed modules that existing approaches cannot achieve, but also can correctly identify the number of communities.",0
28561268,Near infrared spectroscopy for measuring changes in bone hemoglobin content after exercise in individuals with spinal cord injury,"Bone blood perfusion has an essential role in maintaining a healthy bone. However, current methods for measuring bone blood perfusion are expensive and highly invasive. This study presents a custom built near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) instrument to measure changes in bone blood perfusion. We demonstrated the efficacy of this device by monitoring oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes in the human tibia during and after exercise in able-bodied and in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), a population with known impaired peripheral blood perfusion. Nine able-bodied individuals and six volunteers with SCI performed a 10 min rowing exercise (functional electrical stimulation rowing for those with SCI). With exercise, during rowing, able-bodied showed an increase in deoxygenated hemoglobin in the tibia. Post rowing, able-bodied showed an increase in total blood content, characterized by an increase in total hemoglobin content due primarily to an increase in deoxygenated hemoglobin. During rowing and post-rowing, those with SCI showed no change in total blood content in the tibia. The current study demonstrates that NIRS can non-invasively detect changes in hemoglobin concentration in the tibia. (c) 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

18835104,Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy caused by an ovarian cancer expressing tissue factor and vascular endothelial growth factor,"Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM) is a rare clinicopathologic entity causing severe pulmonary hypertension, right-side heart failure, and sudden death. Its histologic features include widespread tumor emboli of the small arteries and arterioles of the lung, associated with thrombus formation and fibrocellular and fibromuscular intimal proliferation. The most frequent causative neoplasm for PTTM is gastric cancer, but lesions in other organs, including the ovary, have been occasionally identified as primary causes. Detailed molecular mechanisms underlying PTTM remain unclear, but some studies have suggested that tissue factor (TF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expressed by tumor cells may be involved in the pathogenesis for cases of gastric cancer. However, little is known about these molecules in PTTM caused by neoplasms of non-gastric origin. Here, we report the autopsy findings of a 42-year-old woman with ovarian cancer showing positive immunoreactivity for both TF and VEGF who died suddenly of PTTM. The present case provides support for the conclusion that these factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of PTTM, independent of the causal neoplasm.",0
9859996,Identification of the receptor component of the IkappaBalpha-ubiquitin ligase,"NF-kappaB, a ubiquitous, inducible transcription factor involved in immune, inflammatory, stress and developmental processes, is retained in a latent form in the cytoplasm of non-stimulated cells by inhibitory molecules, IkappaBs. Its activation is a paradigm for a signal-transduction cascade that integrates an inducible kinase and the ubiquitin-proteasome system to eliminate inhibitory regulators. Here we isolate the pIkappaBalpha-ubiquitin ligase (pIkappaBalpha-E3) that attaches ubiquitin, a small protein which marks other proteins for degradation by the proteasome system, to the phosphorylated NF-kappaB inhibitor pIkappaBalpha. Taking advantage of its high affinity to pIkappaBalpha, we isolate this ligase from HeLa cells by single-step immunoaffinity purification. Using nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry, we identify the specific component of the ligase that recognizes the pIkappaBalpha degradation motif as an F-box/WD-domain protein belonging to a recently distinguished family of beta-TrCP/Slimb proteins. This component, which we denote E3RSIkappaB (pIkappaBalpha-E3 receptor subunit), binds specifically to pIkappaBalpha and promotes its in vitro ubiquitination in the presence of two other ubiquitin-system enzymes, E1 and UBC5C, one of many known E2 enzymes. An F-box-deletion mutant of E3RS(IkappaB), which tightly binds pIkappaBalpha but does not support its ubiquitination, acts in vivo as a dominant-negative molecule, inhibiting the degradation of pIkappaBalpha and consequently NF-kappaB activation. E3RS(IkappaB) represents a family of receptor proteins that are core components of a class of ubiquitin ligases. When these receptor components recognize their specific ligand, which is a conserved, phosphorylation-based sequence motif, they target regulatory proteins containing this motif for proteasomal degradation.",1
25767277,FKBPL is a critical antiangiogenic regulator of developmental and pathological angiogenesis,"OBJECTIVE: The antitumor effects of FK506-binding protein like (FKBPL) and its extracellular role in angiogenesis are well characterized; however, its role in physiological/developmental angiogenesis and the effect of FKBPL ablation has not been evaluated. This is important as effects of some angiogenic proteins are dosage dependent. Here we evaluate the regulation of FKBPL secretion under angiogenic stimuli, as well as the effect of FKBPL ablation in angiogenesis using mouse and zebrafish models. APPROACH AND RESULTS: FKBPL is secreted maximally by human microvascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts, and this was specifically downregulated by proangiogenic hypoxic signals, but not by the angiogenic cytokines, VEGF or IL8. FKBPL's critical role in angiogenesis was supported by our inability to generate an Fkbpl knockout mouse, with embryonic lethality occurring before E8.5. However, whilst Fkbpl heterozygotic embryos showed some vasculature irregularities, the mice developed normally. In murine angiogenesis models, including the ex vivo aortic ring assay, in vivo sponge assay, and tumor growth assay, Fkbpl(+/-) mice exhibited increased sprouting, enhanced vessel recruitment, and faster tumor growth, respectively, supporting the antiangiogenic function of FKBPL. In zebrafish, knockdown of zFkbpl using morpholinos disrupted the vasculature, and the phenotype was rescued with hFKBPL. Interestingly, this vessel disruption was ineffective when zcd44 was knocked-down, supporting the dependency of zFkbpl on zCd44 in zebrafish. CONCLUSIONS: FKBPL is an important regulator of angiogenesis, having an essential role in murine and zebrafish blood vessel development.

The results showed that during the first red alert, the highest hourly-averaged PM2.5 concentration occurred at 19:00 on 9th December with a value of 282 mug.m(-3) and the highest hourly PM2.5 concentration appeared at Yongledian station which is near the southeast border of Beijing, with the peak concentration of 496 mug.m(-3). During the second red alert, the highest hourly-averaged concentration of PM2.5 occurred at 20:00 on 22th with a value of 421 mug.m(-3). The highest hourly PM2.5 concentration was monitored at Liulihe station which is near the southwest border of Beijing, with the peak concentration of 831 mug.m(-3). During the duration period of both red alerts, the concentrations at the southern stations were higher than those at downtown stations and the PM2.5 concentrations at northern stations were found to be the smallest. The difference between these two red alerts was that during the second red alert, the PM2.5 concentrations in southern Beijing were significantly higher than those in the northern area, while the magnitude of this south-to-north gradient was much smaller during the first one. During the second red alert, up to 93% of Beijing area showed an average PM2.5 concentration of above 150 mug.m(-3), which was much larger than that in the first one. The meteorological conditions during the two red alerts were both not conducive to the spread of pollutants. Formation of secondary pollutants and regional pollutant transport existed as well. Though the stagnant weather conditions were in favor of the development of severe pollution, large regional-wide pollutant emission was the main reason for these two heavy air pollutions in Beijing. PM2.5 concentrations were decreased by 20%-25% after the implementation of emergency response measures, which showed the significance of emission reduction in air pollution control.",0
7072192,"An inherited RBC characteristic, NOR, resulting in erythrocyte polyagglutination","This report describes a new inheritable red blood cell characteristic, termed NOR, that is associated with polyagglutination. The NOR factor was shown to be inherited in an apparent dominant manner by 5 members of a two-generation family. NOR was clearly demonstrated to be a unique form of polyagglutination distinguishable from previously reported forms by serological tests using seed lectins, snail agglutinins, enzymes and absorption techniques. The NOR factor was characterized by the lack of reactivity with various seed and snail lectins, enhanced serum agglutinability after RBC proteolytic enzyme treatment, and the ability of hydatid cyst fluid to inhibit the serum hemagglutination reaction.",1
1989602,Genomic organization of the alpha chain of the human C4b-binding protein gene,"C4b-binding protein (C4bp) is a serum glycoprotein that is one of the regulators of the complement activation (RCA) family. This protein is composed of structurally related 70-kDa (alpha chain) and 45-kDa (beta chain) polypeptides. The alpha chain of C4bp (C4bp alpha) consists of eight short consensus repeats (SCR), which constitute the amino-terminal 491 residues. Human C4bp is also one of the acute-phase reactants. In order to clarify the genetic basis of the SCR and to understand the regulatory mechanisms of C4bp synthesis, we isolated 6 genomic DNA clones covering all of the human C4bp alpha gene. This gene consists of 12 exons and spans about 40 kb. Each of the SCRs is encoded by a single exon, except for the second SCR (SCR II), which is encoded by two separate exons, demonstrating that human C4bp alpha has a split SCR at the genomic level. The 5' flanking region was sequenced up to 380 bases upstream from the putative transcription initiation site. Several possible binding sites for transcription factors were identified.",1

9450754,Deficiency of presenilin-1 inhibits the normal cleavage of amyloid precursor protein,"Point mutations in the presenilin-1 gene (PS1) are a major cause of familial Alzheimer's disease. They result in a selective increase in the production of the amyloidogenic peptide amyloid-beta(1-42) by proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Here we investigate whether PS1 is also involved in normal APP processing in neuronal cultures derived from PS1-deficient mouse embryos. Cleavage by alpha- and beta-secretase of the extracellular domain of APP was not affected by the absence of PS1, whereas cleavage by gamma-secretase of the transmembrane domain of APP was prevented, causing carboxyl-terminal fragments of APP to accumulate and a fivefold drop in the production of amyloid peptide. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that PS1 deficiency specifically decreased the turnover of the membrane-associated fragments of APP. As in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism by proteolysis of a membrane-bound transcription factor, PS1 appears to facilitate a proteolytic activity that cleaves the integral membrane domain of APP. Our results indicate that mutations in PS1 that manifest clinically cause a gain of function and that inhibition of PS1 activity is a potential target for anti-amyloidogenic therapy in Alzheimer's disease.",1

20628378,"hsa-miR-520h downregulates ABCG2 in pancreatic cancer cells to inhibit migration, invasion, and side populations","BACKGROUND: Expression of ABCG2 is normally absent or low in the pancreas, but high in human pancreatic cancer cells. The mechanism by which ABCG2 is altered in human cancers remains unknown. METHODS: We investigated ABCG2 expression in four pancreatic cancer cell lines, and used three microRNA (miRNA) target prediction programmes, and information from the existing literature to predict and identify hsa-miR-520h as an miRNA that targets ABCG2. The function of this miRNA was investigated by transient transfection of the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 with oligonucleotides that mimic hsa-miR-520h. RESULTS: Results showed that both mRNA and protein levels of ABCG2 were reduced, indicating that it was a target of hsa-miR-520h. Introduction of hsa-miR-520h mimics into PANC-1 cells also resulted in inhibition of cell migration and invasion, and reduction of side population cells. Cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis were not affected. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the effects of hsa-miR-520h may be, at least in part, caused by its regulation of ABCG2. Thus, our findings provide a new insight into the function of miRNA in the regulation of ABCG2 expression in pancreatic cancer. Gene therapy using miRNA mimics may therefore be useful as a pancreatic cancer therapy.",1

1729378,Human mb-1 gene: complete cDNA sequence and its expression in B cells bearing membrane Ig of various isotypes,"The transmembrane protein, IgM-alpha, a product of mb-1 gene, has been shown to be specifically associated with membrane-bound IgM on the plasma membrane of B lymphocytes. Recent studies have suggested that IgM-alpha may play a role in transducing signals from the Ag receptors during the activation of B cells. A large amount of information has been obtained in the mouse system regarding IgM-alpha and other components of the newly conceived B cell Ag receptor complex. Here we report the cloning and the nucleotide sequencing of cDNA clones of human mb-1, covering the entire length of the mRNA. At the amino acid sequence level, human and murine mb-1 share a high homology in their transmembrane and intracytoplasmic segments, suggesting an important biologic function for these regions of mb-1. A major difference, mainly in the 3' untranslated part, exists between our cDNA sequence and the published partial human mb-1 cDNA sequence. It has also been observed that human mb-1 is expressed not only by B cell lines expressing membrane-bound Ig of mu and delta isotypes but also those expressing membrane-bound Ig of alpha and gamma isotypes.",1
19791388,Reactions of nitric oxide on Rh6+ clusters: abundant chemistry and evidence of structural isomers,"We report the first results of a new instrument for the study of the reactions of naked metal cluster ions using techniques developed by Professor Bondybey to whom this issue is dedicated. Rh6+ ions have been produced using a laser vaporization source and injected into a 3 T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer where they are exposed to a low pressure (< 10(-8) mbar) of nitric oxide, NO. This system exhibits abundant chemistry, the first stages of which we interpret as involving the dissociative chemisorption of multiple NO molecules, followed by the liberation of molecular nitrogen. This yields key intermediates such as [Rh6O2]+ and [Rh6O4]+. The formation of the latter, after adsorption of four NO molecules, marks a change in the chemistry observed with further NO molecules adsorbed (presumably molecularly) without further N2 evolution until saturation is apparently reached with the [Rh6O4(NO)7]+ species. We analyse the data in terms of a simple 12-stage reaction mechanism, and we report the relative rate constants for each step. The trends in reactivity are assessed in terms of conceivable structures and the results are discussed where appropriate by comparison with extended surface studies of the same system. Particular attention is paid to the first step in the reaction (Rh6(+) + NO --> [Rh6NO]+) which exhibits distinctly bi-exponential kinetics, an observation we interpret as evidence for two different structural isomers of the Rh6+ cluster with one reacting more than an order of magnitude faster than the other.",0

The task was a discrete target acquisition task using circular targets of 2.9 mm, 8.1 mm, and 23.5 mm, movement amplitudes of 24.3 mm and 61.7 mm, and eight radial directions including 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, 135 degrees, 180 degrees, 225 degrees, 270 degrees, and 315 degrees. Each device was operated at four gain levels. Ten subjects participated. The results indicated that gain had a significant effect on movement time for both types of pointing devices and exhibited local minimums. Discrete target acquisition at all gains was aptly described using Fitts' Law for both input devices. The mouse gain resulting in minimum movement time and RMS cursor deviation was between 1.0 and 2.0. The minimum movement time and RMS cursor deviation for the head-controlled pointer occurred at a gain between 0.3 and 0.6. Average movement time at the optimal head-controlled pointer gain had a slope of 169 ms/bit and was more than 76% greater than at the optimal mouse gain with a slope of 135 ms/bit. In addition, average RMS displacement was more than 27% greater for the head-controlled pointer at its optimal gain setting than for the mouse. Gain had the greatest effect for small target widths and long movement amplitudes using the head-controlled pointer. Average movement time increased 37% when increasing the head-controlled pointer gain from 0.6 to 1.2 for the small target width, but only increased 0.3% when increasing gain for the large target width. Average movement time also increased 12% when decreasing the head-controlled pointer gain from 0.3 to 0.15 for the long movement amplitude, but decreased 0.3% when decreasing gain for the short movement amplitude.",0

METHOD: Doctors from 12 computerised general practices belonging to the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners' Dunedin Research Unit Computer Network participated in the study (five Dunedin practices, four in rural Otago and Southland, and three in Christchurch). A three-month sample of data was extracted from practice computers and evaluated for completeness and compliance to the national minimum data set structure. Rates of recording practice identifier, provider, patient identifiers, sex, ethnicity, government subsidy eligibility, consultation identifier and date, prescriptions and Read codes were calculated for each practice. RESULTS: Apart from data recorded automatically by computers, there was a wide range in the extent of missing data. Of the data requiring manual computer entry, patient demography and subsidy eligibility were most comprehensively recorded (date of birth 99.9%, sex 99.6%, eligibility to subsidies 98.5%). Data with little immediate clinical or management relevance were poorly recorded (Read codes 32.4% and ethnicity 5.0%). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to derive a common minimum data set from different computerised general practices. However some data elements will be missing unless suitable education and support are provided for the doctors and other staff members who record patient information.",0
30388749,In Vitro Anticancer and Proapoptotic Activities of Steroidal Glycosides from the Starfish Anthenea aspera,"New marine glycoconjugates-the steroidal glycosides designated as anthenosides V(-)X (1(-)3)-and the seven previously known anthenosides E (4), G (5), J (6), K (7), S1 (8), S4 (9), and S6 (10) were isolated from the extract of the tropical starfish Anthenea aspera. The structures of 1(-)3 were elucidated by extensive NMR and ESIMS techniques. Glycoside 1 contains a rare 5alpha-cholest-8(14)-ene-3alpha,7beta,16alpha-hydroxysteroidal nucleus. Compounds 2 and 3 were isolated as inseparable mixtures of epimers. All investigated compounds (1(-)10) at nontoxic concentrations inhibited colony formation of human melanoma RPMI-7951, breast cancer T-47D, and colorectal carcinoma HT-29 cells to a variable degree. The mixture of 6 and 7 possessed significant anticancer activity and induced apoptosis of HT-29 cells. The molecular mechanism of the proapoptotic action of this mixture was shown to be associated with the regulation of anti- and proapoptotic protein expression followed by the activation of initiator and effector caspases.",0
2835369,Two copies of the human apolipoprotein C-I gene are linked closely to the apolipoprotein E gene,"The gene for human apolipoprotein (apo) C-I was selected from human genomic cosmid and lambda libraries. Restriction endonuclease analysis showed that the gene for apoC-I is located 5.5 kilobases downstream of the gene for apoE. A copy of the apoC-I gene, apoC-I', is located 7.5 kilobases downstream of the apoC-I gene. Both genes contain four exons and three introns; the apoC-I gene is 4653 base pairs long, the apoC-I' gene 4387 base pairs. In each gene, the first intron is located 20 nucleotides upstream from the translation start signal; the second intron, within the codon of Gly-7 of the signal peptide region; and the third intron, within the codon for Arg39 of the mature plasma protein coding region. The upstream apoC-I gene encodes the known apoC-I plasma protein and differs from the downstream apoC-I' gene in about 9% of the exon nucleotide positions. The most important difference between the exons results in a change in the codon for Gln-2 of the signal peptide region, which introduces a translation stop signal in the downstream gene. Major sequence differences are found in the second and third introns of the apoC-I and apoC-I' genes, which contain 9 and 7.5 copies, respectively, of Alu family sequences. The apoC-I gene is expressed primarily in the liver, and it is activated when monocytes differentiate into macrophages. In contrast, no mRNA product of the apoC-I' gene can be detected in any tissue, suggesting that it may be a pseudogene. The similar structures and the proximity of the apoE and apoC-I genes suggest that they are derived from a common ancestor. Furthermore, they may be considered to be constituents of a family of seven apolipoprotein genes (apoE, -C-I, -C-II, -C-III, -A-I, -A-II, and -A-IV) that have a common evolutionary origin.",1
11914035,Characterization of six mutations in five Spanish patients with mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase deficiency: effects of amino acid substitutions on tertiary structure,"Mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (T2) deficiency is an inborn error of ketone body and isoleucine metabolism. We identified and characterized 6 mutations, DelE85, K124R, A127V, Q145E, G152A, and E345V in 5 Spanish T2-deficient patients. Transient expression of mutant cDNAs was done at 37 and at 30 degrees C. Expression of the Q145E mutant cDNA resulted in about 12.5% normal amount at 37 degrees C and it retained 15% residual T2, indicating that specific activity of Q145E mutant protein was almost normal. This mutation reduced the heat stability of T2 activity. Although no significant residual activity was detected in either the G152A and A127V substitution, mutant proteins were detected, at 12.5% the normal amount at 37 degrees C and one-half normal at 30 degrees C for A127V, and 25 % only at 30 degrees C for G152A. Mutant proteins with Q145E, G152A, or A127V accumulated at 30 degrees C expression were stable for 48 h at 37 degrees C after cycloheximide treatment. Expression of DelE85, K124R, and E345V cDNAs gave neither residual T2 protein nor T2 activity. We constructed an improved tertiary structural model of T2 based on the X-ray crystal structure of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase of Zoogloea ramigera. On the basis of this model, K124, A127, and G152 are located near the active site, mutations of which might affect catalytic function whereas Q145E, De185E, and E345V are distant from the active site with mutants being expected to destabilize the tertiary structure, especially during protein folding and dimerization.",1
15542026,Three children with lower limb fractures and a mineralization defect: a novel bone fragility disorder?,"In this report, we describe three unrelated children with an apparently novel bone fragility disorder that is associated with an idiopathic mineralization defect. Recurrent lower limb fractures started with weight bearing. The patients had none of the phenotypic, radiological, or histomorphometric features classically associated with known bone fragility disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis (IJO), or mild autosomal dominant osteopetrosis. Radiologically, there was increased metaphyseal trabeculation, normal to increased cortical thickness, and no evidence of rickets or osteomalacia. Areal and volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine did not show any major alteration. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography of the radius showed elevated cortical thickness and total and trabecular volumetric bone mineral density in one patient. Qualitative histology of iliac bone biopsy specimens showed a paucity of the birefringent pattern of normal lamellar bone. Quantitative histomorphometric analysis demonstrated osteomalacia with a prolonged mineralization lag time in the presence of a decreased mineral apposition rate. There was no biochemical evidence of abnormal calcium or phosphate metabolism. Type I collagen mutation analysis was negative. We conclude that this is a bone fragility disorder of moderate severity that tends to cause fractures in the lower extremities and is associated with the accumulation of osteoid due to an intrinsic mineralization defect. The pathogenetic basis for this disorder remains to be elucidated.",1

We cloned a 15-kb DNA fragment containing the Apex gene from a mouse leukocyte genomic library and determined a 4-kb stretch of its nucleotide sequence, including the complete sequence of the mouse Apex gene. The gene consists of 5 exons and 4 introns spanning 2.21 kb, and the boundaries between exons and introns follow the GT/AG rule. Two major and one minor transcription initiation sites were assigned to positions +1 and +24 and position +14, respectively, by a combination of ribonuclease protection, primer extension, and 5' RACE analyses. Position +1 is located 312 nucleotides upstream from the ATG initiation codon. The translation initiation and termination sites are located in exon II and exon V, respectively. The sequenced 5' flanking region (1.32 kb) lacks a typical TATA box, but contains a CAAT box and putative binding sites for several transcription factors, such as ATF, NF-IL6, Sp1, and AP2. The 0.8-kb region from position -410 (5' flanking region) to position +386 (intron II) contains a CpG island.

22275837,Improved drug loading and antibacterial activity of minocycline-loaded PLGA nanoparticles prepared by solid/oil/water ion pairing method,"BACKGROUND: Low drug entrapment efficiency of hydrophilic drugs into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles is a major drawback. The objective of this work was to investigate different methods of producing PLGA nanoparticles containing minocycline, a drug suitable for periodontal infections. METHODS: Different methods, such as single and double solvent evaporation emulsion, ion pairing, and nanoprecipitation were used to prepare both PLGA and PEGylated PLGA nanoparticles. The resulting nanoparticles were analyzed for their morphology, particle size and size distribution, drug loading and entrapment efficiency, thermal properties, and antibacterial activity. RESULTS: The nanoparticles prepared in this study were spherical, with an average particle size of 85-424 nm. The entrapment efficiency of the nanoparticles prepared using different methods was as follows: solid/oil/water ion pairing (29.9%) > oil/oil (5.5%) > water/oil/water (4.7%) > modified oil/water (4.1%) > nano precipitation (0.8%). Addition of dextran sulfate as an ion pairing agent, acting as an ionic spacer between PEGylated PLGA and minocycline, decreased the water solubility of minocycline, hence increasing the drug entrapment efficiency. Entrapment efficiency was also increased when low molecular weight PLGA and high molecular weight dextran sulfate was used. Drug release studies performed in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 indicated slow release of minocycline from 3 days to several weeks. On antibacterial analysis, the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of nanoparticles was at least two times lower than that of the free drug. CONCLUSION: Novel minocycline-PEGylated PLGA nanoparticles prepared by the ion pairing method had the best drug loading and entrapment efficiency compared with other prepared nanoparticles. They also showed higher in vitro antibacterial activity than the free drug.",0

31904542,Molecular cloning and the involvement of IRE1alpha-XBP1s signaling pathway in palmitic acid induced - Inflammation in primary hepatocytes from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea),"Apart from mitigating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, vast studies have demonstrated the crucial role of inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase and endonuclease 1alpha (IRE1alpha) - spliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s) signaling pathway in inflammatory response in mammals. In addition, palmitic acid (PA)-induced inflammation has been verified in large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). However, whether the IRE1alpha-XBP1s signaling pathway is involved in inflammatory response caused by PA remains poorly studied in fish. The present study was aimed at elucidating the role of the IRE1alpha-XBP1s signaling pathway in inflammatory response induced by PA in primary hepatocytes from large yellow croaker. In the present study, the full-length cDNA of ire1alpha and xbp1s were cloned and comprised 3793 bp and 1789 bp with an open reading frame of 3279 bp and 1170 bp, encoding 1093 and 390 amino acids, respectively. IRE1alpha protein possessed a protein kinase and endoribonuclease domain and XBP1s protein possessed a basic-leucine zipper domain. The IRE1alpha protein and XBP1s protein located to the ER membrane and nucleus respectively. The ire1alpha and xbp1s were widely transcribed in various tissues with the higher level in intestine, liver, adipose and head kidney. The ER stress-inducing agent tunicamycin (Tm) and PA treatment significantly activated the IRE1alpha-XBP1s signaling pathway and increased the pro-inflammatory genes expression including tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha), interleukin 6 (il-6) and interleukin 1beta (il-1beta) (P < 0.05). When KIRA6, the IRE1alpha kinase inhibitor, was used to block the IRE1alpha-XBP1s signaling pathway, the Tm and PA-induced pro-inflammatory genes expression was significantly suppressed (P < 0.05). These data indicated that the IRE1alpha-XBP1s signaling pathway was involved in the PA-induced inflammatory response in large yellow croaker.",0
7968466,Clinical use of the 3M 2.5 mm mechanical microcoupling device in free tissue transfer,"The long-term patency of the 2.5 mm mechanical microvascular anastomotic device (the Unilink system) was evaluated in 10 cases of free flap transfer in nine patients between July 1991 and July 1993. Flap survival indicated adequate patency to time of healing. All cases were considered critical end-to-end venous anastomoses, without a parallel conventional microvascular hand-sewn anastomosis associated with the coupling device. The types of flaps used were seven rectus abdominous and one each of serratus anterior and lateral arm muscles and a free jejunum. There were no postoperative complications requiring reexploration. The 2.5 mm device had a rate of 100% flap take with complete healing at an average of 15 months postoperatively. Selected Doppler flow studies depicted the coupler device in vivo with duplex scan verification of venous patency. The 2.5 mm coupler is a versatile anastomotic device for vessels with a diameter of 2.4-3.2 mm. This expands the applicability of the UNILINK system for use in larger diameter vessels.",0
14993613,Vitamin C controls the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel,"Vitamin C (l-ascorbate) is present in the respiratory lining fluid of human lungs, and local deficits occur during oxidative stress. Here we report a unique function of vitamin C on the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-dependent Cl channel that regulates epithelial surface fluid secretion. Vitamin C (100 microM) induced the openings of CFTR Cl channels by increasing its average open probability from 0 to 0.21 +/- 0.08, without a detectable increase in intracellular cAMP levels. Exposure of the apical airway surface to vitamin C stimulated the transepithelial Cl secretion to 68% of forskolin-stimulated currents. The average half-maximal stimulatory constant was 36.5 +/- 2.9 microM, which corresponds to physiological concentrations. When vitamin C was instilled into the nasal epithelium of human subjects, it effectively activated Cl transport in vivo. In CF epithelia, previous treatment of the underlying trafficking defect with trimethylamine oxide or expression of WT CFTR restored the activation of Cl transport by vitamin C. Sodium dependency and phloretin sensitivity, as well as the expression of transcripts for sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter (SVCT)-1 and SVCT2, support a model in which an apical vitamin C transporter is central for relaying the effect of vitamin C to CFTR. We conclude that cellular vitamin C is a biological regulator of CFTR-mediated Cl secretion in epithelia. The pool of vitamin C in the respiratory tract represents a potential nutraceutical and pharmaceutical target for the complementary treatment of sticky airway secretions by enhancing epithelial fluid secretion.",1
7142288,31P nuclear magnetic resonance evidence for the regulation of intracellular pH by Ehrlich ascites tumor cells,"The phenomenon of intracellular pH (pHin) regulation in cultured Ehrlich ascites cells was investigated using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Measurements were made with a Bruker WH 360 wide bore NMR spectrometer at a 31P frequency of 145.78 MHz. Samples at a density of 10(8) cells ml-1 were suspended in a final volume of 2 ml of growth medium in 10 mm diameter NMR tubes. Intracellular pH was calculated from the chemical shifts of either intracellular inorganic phosphate (Piin) or intracellular 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate (2dG6Pin). The sugar phosphate was used as a pH probe to supplement the Piin measurements, which could not always be observed. When available, the pHin calculated from the Piin peak was identical within experimental error to the pHin calculated from the 2dG6Pin peak. Intracellular pH was measured to be more alkaline than the medium at an external pH (pHex) below 7.1. Typical values were pHin = 7.00 for pHex = 6.50. These measurements were constant for times up to 165 min using well-energized, respiring cells. This pH gradient was seen to collapse immediately upon onset of anaerobic shock. Above a pHex of 7.2 there was no significant difference between pHin and pHex. These results unequivocally demonstrate the steady state nature of the pH regulation and its dependence upon energization.",0

The patient was diagnosed with intralymphatic histiocytosis (ILH) based on the biopsy findings. Because the patient was unresponsive to single-agent treatment with methotrexate, infliximab and etanercept, we switched to tocilizumab (TCZ) treatment, which induced remission of the ILH. Our case suggests that TCZ may be a treatment option for ILH in patients with RA. ",0
7808841,Preliminary localization of a gene for autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism to chromosome 3q13,"A large family in which hypoparathyroidism was observed to segregate as an autosomal dominant trait in three generations was identified. Mutation in the PTH gene was excluded by linkage and single-stranded conformational analysis. The hypocalcemic phenotype in this family was mapped by linkage analysis using short, tandem-repeat polymorphisms to the region of chromosome 3q13. A maximum lod score of 2.71 at theta = 0.0 was observed with marker D3S1303. Positive lod scores were observed at theta = 0.0 with markers flanking D3S1303. Multipoint linkage analysis gave a lod score of 2.71 for the region flanking D3S1303. Simulation using the computer program SLINK showed that a lod score of 2.71 at theta = 0.0 was the maximum lod score possible given the pedigree structure. The simulation also showed that given the structure of the pedigree the probability of observing a lod score of 2.71 at theta = 0.0 by chance was 1 in 1000. The data presented above provide important preliminary evidence supporting linkage to chromosome 3q13. This region contains a Ca(2+)-sensing receptor gene that is proposed as a key signal transduction element for changes in extracellular Ca2+ concentrations in mechanisms of regulation of PTH secretion from parathyroid cells. The mutation in this family may activate the Ca(2+)-sensing receptor suppressing PTH secretion and lowering the ",1
18328027,Health technology assessment of a homecare device for telemonitoring and telerehabilitation for patients after hand transplantation,"Hand rehabilitation requires continuous and frequent monitoring of the functionality in order to assess therapy and/or refine it. In order to contain costs for the rehabilitation program, a telehomecare rehabilitation system is suitable. The purpose of this paper was to describe the setup and configuration of a homecare device for telemonitoring/telerehabilitation of patients who underwent hand transplant. The telehomecare device allows the assessment of dynamics and kinematics of hand function by integrating dedicated software in two components. The first was a commercial glove, the HumanGlove by Humanware (Pisa, Italy). The second was a set of instruments for the measurement of digit force using an Instrumented Keyboard and an Instrumented Mouse-Like device. The software integrating the devices is composed of two modular components. The first is to drive the devices; the second is for the data-analysis and display. The methodology was validated at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit (the Italian National Institute of Health) in the framework of an Italian National Project, funded by the Ministry of Health.",0
26009755,Effect of the presence of hens on roosters sperm variables,"This study examines the effect of the presence of hens on sperm variables in Black Barred Andaluza roosters (which respond well to the massage technique). Between 8 and 22 weeks of age, roosters (n = 60) were housed separate from hens in straw litter pens (4 birds/m(2)). Two groups of roosters were then formed to study the effect of hen presence on sperm variables at 36 weeks of age. The first group (n = 11 roosters) was housed with hens (n = 55; sex ratio 1:5), while the second (n = 27 roosters) was again housed separate from hens. Twenty four sperm pools were obtained over 12 weeks (12 pools from each group, each pool produced by mixing semen from 11 males) for analysis. Compared to the no-female-contact group, the roosters living with hens showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced percentages of non-progressive motile sperm and slow sperm, and significantly increased VCL and VSL values; they also showed trends (P < 0.1) towards increased progressive motility and a higher percentage of rapid sperm. The presence of hens had no significant effect on the number of spermatozoa per ejaculate or sperm concentration. Positive correlations were recorded between VSL and VCL, and between both of these and progressive motility, and the percentage of rapid sperm. In addition, both VSL and VCL correlated negatively with non-progressive motility and the percentage of slow sperm. These results indicate that rooster sperm quality, but not quantity, improves in the presence of hens. ",0
16551709,"Spectrum of mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, and TP53 in families at high risk of breast cancer","CONTEXT: Genetic testing for inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 has become integral to the care of women with a severe family history of breast or ovarian cancer, but an unknown number of patients receive negative (ie, wild-type) results when they actually carry a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Furthermore, other breast cancer genes generally are not evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and types of undetected cancer-predisposing mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, TP53, and PTEN among patients with breast cancer from high-risk families with negative (wild-type) genetic test results for BRCA1 and BRCA2. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between 2002-2005, probands from 300 US families with 4 or more cases of breast or ovarian cancer but with negative (wild-type) commercial genetic test results for BRCA1 and BRCA2 were screened by multiple DNA-based and RNA-based methods to detect genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and germline mutations of all classes in CHEK2, TP53, and PTEN. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Previously undetected germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, TP53, and PTEN that predispose to breast cancer; frequencies of these mutations among families with negative genetic test results. RESULTS: Of the 300 probands, 52 (17%) carried previously undetected mutations, including 35 (12%) with genomic rearrangements of BRCA1 or BRCA2, 14 (5%) with CHEK2 mutations, and 3 (1%) with TP53 mutations. At BRCA1 and BRCA2, 22 different genomic rearrangements were found, of sizes less than 1 kb to greater than 170 kb; of these, 14 were not previously described and all were individually rare. At CHEK2, a novel 5.6-kb genomic deletion was discovered in 2 families of Czechoslovakian ancestry. This deletion was found in 8 of 631 (1.3%) patients with breast cancer and in none of 367 healthy controls in the Czech and Slovak Republics. For all rearrangements, exact genomic breakpoints were determined and diagnostic primers validated. The 3 families with TP53 mutations included cases of childhood sarcoma or brain tumors in addition to multiple cases of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The mutational spectra of BRCA1 and BRCA2 include many high-penetrance, individually rare genomic rearrangements. Among patients with breast cancer and severe family histories of cancer who test negative (wild type) for BRCA1 and BRCA2, approximately 12% can be expected to carry a large genomic deletion or duplication in one of these genes, and approximately 5% can be expected to carry a mutation in CHEK2 or TP53. Effective methods for identifying these mutations should be made available to women at high risk.",1

Here we show that the multidrug transporter BCRP (encoded by ABCG2) is strongly induced in the mammary gland of mice, cows and humans during lactation and that it is responsible for the active secretion of clinically and toxicologically important substrates such as the dietary carcinogen PhIP, the anticancer drug topotecan and the antiulcerative cimetidine into mouse milk.",1

15181130,Assessment of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis with (18)F-FDG PET,"UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to assess synovitis by (18)F-FDG PET in an individual joint analysis and in a global analysis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity and to compare (18)F-FDG PET parameters with clinical, biologic, and sonographic (US) rheumatoid parameters. METHODS: Three hundred fifty-six joints were assessed in 21 patients with active RA: the knees in all subjects and either wrists as well as metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints in 13 patients, or ankles and the first metatarsophalangeal joints in the remaining 8 patients. PET analysis consisted of a visual identification of (18)F-FDG uptake in the synovium and measurements of standardized uptake values (SUVs). Independent assessors performed the clinical and US examinations. RESULTS: PET positivity was found in 63% of joints, whereas 75%, 79%, and 56% were positive for swelling, tenderness, and US analysis, respectively. Both the rate of PET-positive joints and the SUV increased with the number of positive parameters present (swelling, tenderness, US positivity) and with the synovial thickness. The mean SUV was significantly higher in joints where a power Doppler signal was found. In a global PET analysis, the number of PET-positive joints and the cumulative SUV were significantly correlated with the swollen and tender joint counts, the patient and physician global assessments, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein serum levels, the disease activity score and the simplified disease activity index, the number of US-positive joints, and the cumulative synovial thickness. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET is a unique imaging technique that can assess the metabolic activity of synovitis and measure the disease activity in RA.",0
10683156,Mammalian S-phase checkpoint integrity is dependent on transformation status and purine deoxyribonucleosides,"In eukaryotic cells arrested in S-phase, checkpoint controls normally restrain mitosis until after replication. We have identified an array of previously unsuspected factors that modulate this restraint, using transformed hamster cells in which cycle controls are known to be altered in S-phase arrest. Arrested cells accumulate cyclin B, the regulatory partner of the mitotic p34(cdc2) kinase, which is normally not abundant until late G(2) phase; treatment of arrested cells with caffeine produces rapid S-phase condensation. We show here that such S-phase checkpoint slippage, as visualised through caffeine-dependent S-phase condensation, correlates with rodent origin and transformed status, is opposed by reverse transformation, and is favoured by c-src and opposed by wnt1 overexpression. Slippage is also dependent on a prolonged replicative arrest, and is favoured by arrest with hydroxyurea, which inhibits ribonucleotide reductase. This last is a key enzyme in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, recently identified as a determinant of malignancy. Addition of deoxyribonucleosides shows that rapid S-phase condensation is suppressed by a novel checkpoint mechanism: purine (but not pyrimidine) deoxyribonucleosides, like reverse transformation, suppress cyclin B/p34(cdc2) activation by caffeine, but not cyclin B accumulation. Thus, ribonucleotide reductase has an unexpectedly complex role in mammalian cell cycle regulation: not only is it regulated in response to cycle progression, but its products can also reciprocally influence cell cycle control kinase activation.",0
21159799,A novel Akt3 mutation associated with enhanced kinase activity and seizure susceptibility in mice,"In a phenotype-driven mutagenesis screen, a novel, dominant mouse mutation, Nmf350, caused low seizure threshold, sporadic tonic-clonic seizures, brain enlargement and ectopic neurons in the dentate hilus and molecular layer of the hippocampus. Genetic mapping implicated Akt3, one of four candidates within the critical interval. Sequencing analysis revealed that mutants have a missense mutation in Akt3 (encoding one of three AKT/protein kinase B molecules), leading to a non-synonymous amino acid substitution in the highly conserved protein kinase domain. Previous knockout studies showed that Akt3 is pivotal in postnatal brain development, including a smaller brain, although seizures were not observed. In contrast to Akt3(Nmf350), we find that Akt3 null mice exhibit an elevated seizure threshold. An in vitro kinase assay revealed that Akt3(Nmf350) confers higher enzymatic activity, suggesting that Akt3(Nmf350) might enhance AKT signaling in the brain. In the dentate gyrus of Akt3(Nmf350) homozygotes, we also observed a modest increase in immunoreactivity of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6, an AKT pathway downstream target. Together these findings suggest that Akt3(Nmf350) confers an increase of AKT3 activity in specific neuronal populations in the brain, and a unique dominant phenotype. Akt3(Nmf350) mice provide a new tool for studying physiological roles of AKT signaling in the brain, and potentially novel mechanisms for epilepsy.",1
11257105,The ABC of APC,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by the presence of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum, with inevitable development of colorectal cancer if left untreated. FAP is caused by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Somatic mutations in the APC gene are an early event in colorectal tumorigenesis, and can be detected in the majority of colorectal tumours. The APC gene encodes a large protein with multiple cellular functions and interactions, including roles in signal transduction in the wnt-signalling pathway, mediation of intercellular adhesion, stabilization of the cytoskeleton and possibly regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. The fact that APC is an integral part of so many different pathways makes it an ideal target for mutation in carcinogenesis. This review deals with our understanding to date of how mutations in the APC gene translate into changes at the protein level, which in turn contribute to the role of APC in tumorigenesis.",1

1851997,Molecular cloning and identification of a serine/threonine protein kinase of the second-messenger subfamily,"A partial cDNA was isolated that encoded a protein kinase, termed rac (related to the A and C kinases). This cDNA was subsequently used to screen libraries derived from the human cell lines MCF-7 and WI38 and led to the isolation of full-length cDNA clones. DNA sequence analysis identified an open reading frame of 1440 base pairs encoding a protein of 480 amino acids (Mr, 55,716). This result was supported by the synthesis of a Mr 58,000 protein in an in vitro translation system that used RNA transcribed from cloned cDNAs with SP6 RNA polymerase. The predicted protein contains consensus sequences characteristic of a protein kinase catalytic domain and shows 73% and 68% similarity to protein kinase C and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively. Northern (RNA) analysis revealed a single mRNA transcript of 3.2 kilobases that varied up to 300-fold between different cell lines. Specific antisera directed towards the carboxyl terminal of the rac protein kinase were prepared and used to identify that phosphorylated several substrates in immunoprecipitates prepared with the rac-specific antisera.",1
28912253,Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model Predictions of Panobinostat (LBH589) as a Victim and Perpetrator of Drug-Drug Interactions,"Panobinostat (Farydak) is an orally active hydroxamic acid-derived histone deacetylase inhibitor used for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Based on recombinant cytochrome P450 (P450) kinetic analyses in vitro, panobinostat oxidative metabolism in human liver microsomes was mediated primarily by CYP3A4 with lower contributions by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. Panobinostat was also an in vitro reversible and time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 and a reversible inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. Based on a previous clinical drug-drug interaction study with ketoconazole (KTZ), the contribution of CYP3A4 in vivo was estimated to be  approximately 40%. Using clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data from several trials, including the KTZ drug-drug interaction (DDI) study, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was built to predict panobinostat PK after single and multiple doses (within 2-fold of observed values for most trials) and the clinical DDI with KTZ (predicted and observed area under the curve ratios of 1.8). The model was then applied to predict the drug interaction with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin (RIF) and the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate midazolam (MDZ) in lieu of clinical trials. Panobinostat exposure was predicted to decrease in the presence of RIF (65%) and inconsequentially increase MDZ exposure (4%). Additionally, PBPK modeling was used to examine the effects of stomach pH on the absorption of panobinostat in humans and determined that absorption of panobinostat is not expected to be affected by increases in stomach pH. The results from these studies were incorporated into the Food and Drug Administration-approved product label, providing guidance for panobinostat dosing recommendations when it is combined with other drugs.",0
8090769,Genomic organization and structure of Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase: localization of mutations associated with varied clinical presentations and course in X chromosome-linked agammaglobulinemia,"X chromosome-linked agammaglobulinemia is a life-threatening disease that involves a failure in normal development of B lymphocytes and is associated with missense mutations in BTK, a gene encoding a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase, EC 2.7.1.112), a member of the Tec family of protein-tyrosine kinases. The genomic organization has been determined by using conventional restriction fragment mapping, extended DNA sequencing, and PCR fragment-sizing approaches. The DNA sequences of the 18 coding exons composing BTK and their flanking-region sequences are reported; an additional exon(s) encodes a 5' untranslated segment. Single-base-pair substitutions and 4-nt deletions resulted in amino acid replacement, premature termination, frameshift, and exon deletion in a group of X chromosome-linked agammaglobulinemia patients exhibiting different clinical presentations and courses. The nature of the mutations is interpreted in terms of the genomic organization of the BTK gene and the disease course in individual patients. Several examples are found in which the same mutation occurs in unrelated patients, and one of these mutations occurs at the same codon that is substituted in the murine form of BTK, resulting in X chromosome-linked immunodeficiency disease. Considerable variation in presentation and disease course in X chromosome-linked agammaglobulinemia appears associated with the nature and position of different missense mutations.",1
23776692,Effects of the selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB-269970 and amisulpride on ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like deficits in rats,"A wide body of evidence suggests that 5-HT7 receptors are implicated in a variety of central nervous system functions, including control of learning and memory processes. According to recent preclinical data, the selective blockade of these receptors may be a potential target for cognitive improvement in schizophrenia. The first aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, SB-269970, and the antipsychotic drug with a high affinity for 5-HT7 receptors, amisulpride, on ketamine-induced deficits in attentional set-shifting and novel object recognition tasks in rats. Because the role of 5-HT7 receptor blockade in ameliorating positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia remains equivocal, the second aim of these experiments was to examine the effectiveness of SB-269970 and amisulpride in reversing ketamine-induced deficits in prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex and in social interaction test in rats. The study revealed that acute administration of SB-269970 (1 mg/kg) or amisulpride (3 mg/kg) ameliorated ketamine-induced cognitive inflexibility and novel object recognition deficit in rats. Both compounds were also effective in attenuating ketamine-evoked disruption of social interactions. In contrast, neither SB-269970 nor amisulpride affected ketamine-disrupted prepulse inhibition or 50 kHz USVs accompanying social behaviour. In conclusion, antagonism of 5-HT7 receptors may represent a useful pharmacological approach in the treatment of cognitive deficits and some negative symptoms of schizophrenia.",0
25205116,"Inherited bone marrow failure associated with germline mutation of ACD, the gene encoding telomere protein TPP1","Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that is necessary for overcoming telomere shortening in human germ and stem cells. Mutations in telomerase or other telomere-maintenance proteins can lead to diseases characterized by depletion of hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow failure (BMF). Telomerase localization to telomeres requires an interaction with a region on the surface of the telomere-binding protein TPP1 known as the TEL patch. Here, we identify a family with aplastic anemia and other related hematopoietic disorders in which a 1-amino-acid deletion in the TEL patch of TPP1 (DeltaK170) segregates with disease. All family members carrying this mutation, but not those with wild-type TPP1, have short telomeres. When introduced into 293T cells, TPP1 with the DeltaK170 mutation is able to localize to telomeres but fails to recruit telomerase to telomeres, supporting a causal relationship between this TPP1 mutation and bone marrow disorders. ACD/TPP1 is thus a newly identified telomere-related gene in which mutations cause aplastic anemia and related BMF disorders.",1
29490642,Eating Disorder Quality of Life Scale (EDQLS) in ethnically diverse college women: an exploratory factor analysis,"BACKGROUND: Extant research suggests that disordered eating is common in college women and is associated with decreased quality of life. The Eating Disorder Quality of Life Scale (EDQLS) examines impairment to disordered eating-related quality of life, but has not been validated in college women. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to examine the reliability, validity, and factor structure of the EDQLS in a diverse sample of 971 college women. METHOD: Students from a large United States university completed questionnaires examining disordered eating and the EDQLS online. RESULTS: The EDQLS demonstrated excellent internal consistency and good convergent validity with the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDEQ). Contrary to the original 12-domain design of the EDQLS, principal component analyses suggested five factors that mapped onto the following constructs: (1) Positive Emotionality; (2) Body/Weight Dissatisfaction; (3) Disordered Eating Behaviors; (4) Negative Emotionality; and (5) Social Engagement. However, 15 of the 40 items loaded onto multiple factors. CONCLUSIONS: Total scores on the EDQLS are reliable and valid when used with diverse samples of college women, but some revisions are needed to create subscales than can justifiably be used in clinical practice.",0

9824989,Frequent occurrence of diabetes mellitus after corticosteroid treatment in mixed cryoglobulinemia. An HCV-related complication?,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is characterized by a variety of extra-hepatic manifestations in many individuals. Among these, diabetes mellitus (DM) can be included, as such a metabolic disorder has been demonstrated to be more frequent in chronic hepatitis C than in liver disease due to other causes. Recently, we have observed that most patients affected with HCV-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia (13 out of 15, 86.7%), that were at baseline normoglycemic, developed DM following corticosteroid treatment (prednisone > 25 mg/daily) for at least three months. Conversely, when we consider a control group including 36 HCV negative patients affected with various immunomediated disorders, i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, poly/dermatomyositis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, that were initially normoglycemic, corticosteroid induced DM (prednisone > 25 mg/daily for at least three months) occurred only in 16.7% of subjects. Moreover, in other two HCV positive patients suffering from myasthenia gravis, prolonged corticosteroid treatment was complicated by DM. These data, that are still unclear from a pathophysiologic viewpoint, seem to indicate corticosteroid induced DM as a further, unusual extra-hepatic manifestation of the HCV infection.",0
1516231,Linkage analysis in properdin deficiency families: refined location in proximal Xp,"Properdin is a component of the alternative activation pathway of the complement system. Deficiency or dysfunction of the protein is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. Affected males have an increased risk of developing meningococcal disease. Six multi-generation families with different types of properdin deficiency were analyzed using microsatellite and other polymorphisms on the X chromosome. Based on multipoint data, it was found that the disease gene maps close to DXS255 (Zmax = 13.3 at theta max = 0.00) and DXS426 (Zmax = 12.9 at theta max = 0.00) on the Xp-arm near the centromere. There was no indication of genetic heterogeneity among the six families analyzed. Thus it is now possible to perform accurate DNA-based determination of the inheritance of the mutation in affected families.",1
30719268,Immunotherapy in myeloma: how far have we come?,"The treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) has evolved substantially over the past decades, leading to a significantly improved outcome of MM patients. The introduction of high-dose therapy, especially, and autologous stem cell transplantation, as well as the development of new drugs, such as immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors have contributed to the improvement in survival. However, eventually most MM patients relapse, which indicates that there is a need for new agents and novel treatment strategies. Importantly, the long-term survival in a subset of MM patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation illustrates the potential of immunotherapy in MM, but allogeneic stem cell transplantation is also associated with a high rate of treatment-related mortality. Recently, a better insight into several immune-evasion mechanisms, which contribute to tumor progression, has resulted in the development of active and well-tolerated novel forms of immunotherapy. These immunotherapeutic agents can be used as monotherapy, or, even more successfully, in combination with other established anti-MM agents to further improve depth and duration of response by preventing the outgrowth of resistant clones. This review will discuss the mechanisms used by MM cells to evade the immune system, and also provide an overview of currently approved immunotherapeutic drugs, such as IMiDs (e.g. lenalidomide and pomalidomide) and monoclonal antibodies that target cell surface antigens present on the MM cell (e.g. elotuzumab and daratumumab), as well as novel immunotherapies (e.g. chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, bispecific antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors) currently in clinical development in MM.",0
32079441,Methane attenuates lung ischemia-reperfusion injury via regulating PI3K-AKT-NFkappaB signaling pathway,"Objective: This study aims to investigate the protective effects and possible mechanism of methane-rich saline (MS) on lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) in rats.Methods: MS (2 ml/kg and 20 ml/kg) was injected intraperitoneally in rats after LIRI. Lung injury was assayed by Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and wet-to-dry weight (W/D). The cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and blood were counted. Oxidative stress was examined by the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were determined by ELISA. Lung tissue apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining and western blotting of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3. The expressions of Ismall ka, CyrillicBalpha, p38, PI3K, AKT, and NF-kappaB were analyzed with Western blotting.Results: MS effectively decreased the lung W/D ratio as well as the lung pathological damage and reduced the localized infiltration of inflammatory cells. Methane suppressed the expression of the PI3K-AKT-NFkappaB signaling pathway during the lung IR injury, which inhibited the activation of NF-kB and decreased the level of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-10. Moreover, we found that MS treatment relieved reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage by downregulating MDA and upregulating SOD. MS treatment also regulated apoptosis-related proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3.Conclusions: MS could repair LIRI and reduce the release of oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and cell apoptosis via the PI3K-AKT-NFkappaB signaling pathway, which may provide a novel and promising strategy for the treatment of LIRI.",0
11300656,"KT3-671, an angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist, attenuates vascular but not cardiac responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation in pithed rats","Effects of KT3-671 on vascular and cardiac sympathetic neurotransmission were investigated in pithed rats. The pressor response to spinal stimulation (5 Hz) of the pithed rat without the adrenals was approximately 75% of that with the adrenals. Guanethidine (8 mg/kg, i.v.) decreased by about 76% the pressor response to sympathetic stimulation in the pithed rat with intact adrenals and the guanethidine-resistant response was almost completely abolished by bilateral adrenalectomy. Therefore, the following experiments were done using the pithed rat without the adrenals. KT3-671 (1-10 mg/kg, i.v.) as well as losartan (1-10 mg/kg, i.v.) inhibited dose-dependently the pressor response to sympathetic stimulation. KT3-671 was approximately four times more potent than losartan in inhibiting the pressor response. The two angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonists (10 mg/kg, i.v.) did not affect the pressor response to exogenously administered norepinephrine. Neither KT3-671 nor losartan influenced the tachycardia induced by spinal stimulation and isoprenaline. Intravenous infusion of angiotensin II (100 ng/kg/min) did not affect both pressor and tachycardic responses to sympathetic stimulation. In conclusion, KT3-671 as well as losartan inhibits vascular but not cardiac sympathetic neurotransmission of the pithed rats, which may contribute to its overall antihypertensive efficacy.",0
25855295,Crystal structures of the human adiponectin receptors,"Adiponectin stimulation of its receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, increases the activities of 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), respectively, thereby contributing to healthy longevity as key anti-diabetic molecules. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 were predicted to contain seven transmembrane helices with the opposite topology to G-protein-coupled receptors. Here we report the crystal structures of human AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 at 2.9 and 2.4 A resolution, respectively, which represent a novel class of receptor structure. The seven-transmembrane helices, conformationally distinct from those of G-protein-coupled receptors, enclose a large cavity where three conserved histidine residues coordinate a zinc ion. The zinc-binding structure may have a role in the adiponectin-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation and UCP2 upregulation. Adiponectin may broadly interact with the extracellular face, rather than the carboxy-terminal tail, of the receptors. The present information will facilitate the understanding of novel structure-function relationships and the development and optimization of AdipoR agonists for the treatment of obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes.

9666097,Organization of the ABCR gene: analysis of promoter and splice junction sequences,"Mutations in the human ABCR gene have been associated with the autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP19), and cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) and have also been found in a fraction of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients. The ABCR gene is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily and encodes a rod photoreceptor-specific membrane protein. The cytogenetic location of the ABCR gene was refined to 1p22.3-1p22.2. The intron/exon structure was determined for the ABCR gene from overlapping genomic clones. ABCR spans over 100kb and comprises 50 exons. Intron/exon splice site sequences are presented for all exons and analyzed for information content (Ri). Nine splice site sequence variants found in STGD and AMD patients are evaluated as potential mutations. The localization of splice sites reveals a high degree of conservation between other members of the ABC1 subfamily, e.g. the mouse Abc1 gene. Analysis of the 870-bp 5' upstream of the transcription start sequence reveals multiple putative photoreceptor-specific regulatory elements including a novel retina-specific transcription factor binding site. These results will be useful in further mutational screening of the ABCR gene in various retinopathies and for determining the substrate and/or function of this photoreceptor-specific ABC transporter.",1
3943062,Chromosome changes in malignant mesothelioma,"Cytogenetic study was made of mesothelioma cells from 14 patients. Metaphases were obtained from 12 tumors and revealed aneuploidy and clonal abnormalities in 9 specimens. In the two remaining cases, no metaphases were obtained. The cytogenetic abnormalities were complex, and up to 12 marker chromosomes were observed in the tumors. Rearrangements of chromosomes #1, #2, #3, #6, #9, #11, #17, and #22 were most frequently observed. Chromosome markers involved diverse bands, including several that are loci of oncogenes, fragile sites, and nonrandom rearrangements in other types of cancer. This study shows that the karyotypes of malignant mesothelioma can be analyzed by standard cytogenetic techniques. Additional studies of untreated mesothelioma may help to distinguish primary cytogenetic changes from effects of prior therapy in some of our patients.",0

28946632,On-Board Detection of Pedestrian Intentions,"Avoiding vehicle-to-pedestrian crashes is a critical requirement for nowadays advanced driver assistant systems (ADAS) and future self-driving vehicles. Accordingly, detecting pedestrians from raw sensor data has a history of more than 15 years of research, with vision playing a central role. During the last years, deep learning has boosted the accuracy of image-based pedestrian detectors. However, detection is just the first step towards answering the core question, namely is the vehicle going to crash with a pedestrian provided preventive actions are not taken? Therefore, knowing as soon as possible if a detected pedestrian has the intention of crossing the road ahead of the vehicle is essential for performing safe and comfortable maneuvers that prevent a crash. However, compared to pedestrian detection, there is relatively little literature on detecting pedestrian intentions. This paper aims to contribute along this line by presenting a new vision-based approach which analyzes the pose of a pedestrian along several frames to determine if he or she is going to enter the road or not. We present experiments showing 750 ms of anticipation for pedestrians crossing the road, which at a typical urban driving speed of 50 km/h can provide 15 additional meters (compared to a pure pedestrian detector) for vehicle automatic reactions or to warn the driver. Moreover, in contrast with state-of-the-art methods, our approach is monocular, neither requiring stereo nor optical flow information.",0
11257107,DNA helicase deficiencies associated with cancer predisposition and premature ageing disorders,"Deficiency in a helicase of the RecQ family is found in at least three human genetic disorders associated with cancer predisposition and/or premature ageing. The RecQ helicases encoded by the BLM, WRN and RECQ4 genes are defective in Bloom's, Werner's and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes, respectively. Cells derived from individuals with these disorders in each case show inherent genomic instability. Recent studies have demonstrated direct interactions between these RecQ helicases and human nuclear proteins required for several aspects of chromosome maintenance, including p53, BRCA1, topoisomerase III, replication protein A and DNA polymerase delta. Here, we review this network of protein interactions, and the clues that they present regarding the potential roles of RecQ family members in DNA repair, replication and/or recombination pathways.",1
7925473,Structure of the human CALM1 calmodulin gene and identification of two CALM1-related pseudogenes CALM1P1 and CALM1P2,"The human CALM1 calmodulin gene has been isolated and characterized. The gene contains six exons spread over about 10 kb of genomic DNA. The exon-intron structure is identical to that of the human CALM3 and of the rat CALM1 and CALM3 genes. A cluster of transcription-start sites was identified 200 bp upstream of the ATG translation-start codon, and several putative regulatory elements were found in the 5' flanking region as well as in intron 1. Sequence comparison with the rat CALM1 gene revealed significant similarities in the promoter regions of the two genes and an even more striking degree of identity (70%) in the available intron 1 sequences. A short CAG trinucleotide repeat region was identified in the 5' untranslated region of the human CALM1 gene; this sequence is not conserved in the rat counterpart. Expression of the CALM1 gene was detected in all human tissues tested, although at varying levels. A 1.7-kb mRNA was uniformly present at comparable levels, whereas a 4.2-kb mRNA species was particularly abundant in brain and skeletal muscle. Clones for two different CALM1-related pseudogenes CALM1P1 and CALM1P2 were also isolated and characterized. Both pseudogenes are intronless and non-functional as judged from the presence of mutations abolishing the open reading frame. Genomic Southern analysis indicates that the human CALM1 gene/pseudogene subfamily comprises at least three but probably no more than four members. The entire family consists of three bona fide CALM genes, at least one expressed calmodulin-like CALML gene as well as at least five pseudogenes.",1
27484237,Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Otitis Media in an Indigenous Filipino Population,"OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic and environmental risk factors for otitis media in an indigenous Filipino population. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Indigenous Filipino community. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Clinical history and information on breastfeeding, tobacco smoke exposure, and swimming were obtained from community members. Heads of households were interviewed for family history and personal beliefs on ear health. Height and weight were measured. Otoscopic findings were described for the presence and character of perforation or discharge. An A2ML1 duplication variant that confers otitis media susceptibility was Sanger sequenced in all DNA samples. Co-occurrence of middle ear bacteria detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencing was determined according to A2ML1 genotype and social cluster. RESULTS: The indigenous Filipino population has a ~50% prevalence of otitis media. Young age was associated with otitis media (4 age strata; P = .004); however, age was nonsignificant as a bistratal or continuous variable. There was no association between otitis media and sex, body mass index, breastfeeding, tobacco exposure, or deep swimming. In multivariate analyses, A2ML1 genotype is the strongest predictor of otitis media, with an odds ratio of 3.7 (95% confidence interval: 1.3-10.8; P = .005). When otitis media diagnoses were plotted across ages, otitis media was observed within the first year of life, and chronic otitis media persisted up to adulthood, particularly in A2ML1-variant carriers. CONCLUSION: Among indigenous Filipinos, A2ML1 genotype is the primary risk factor for otitis media and main determinant of disease progression, although age, the middle ear microbiome, and social clusters might modulate the effect of the A2ML1 genotype.",1
19293182,"A novel human AlkB homologue, ALKBH8, contributes to human bladder cancer progression","We recently identified a novel human AlkB homologue, ALKBH8, which is expressed in various types of human cancers including human urothelial carcinomas. In examining the role and function of ALKBH8 in human bladder cancer development in vitro, we found that silencing of ALKBH8 through small interfering RNA transfection reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via down-regulation of NAD(P)H oxidase-1 (NOX-1) and induced apoptosis through subsequent activation of c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. However, we also found that JNK and p38 activation resulted in phosphorylation of H2AX (gammaH2AX), a variant of mammalian histone H2A, which contributes to the apoptosis induced by silencing ALKBH8 and NOX-1. Silencing of ALKBH8 significantly suppressed invasion, angiogenesis, and growth of bladder cancers in vivo as assessed both in the chorioallantoic membrane assay and in an orthotopic mouse model using green fluorescent protein-labeled KU7 human urothelial carcinoma cells. Immunohistochemical examination showed high expression of ALKBH8 and NOX-1 proteins in high-grade, superficially and deeply invasive carcinomas (pT(1) and >pT(2)) as well as in carcinoma in situ, but not in low-grade and noninvasive phenotypes (pT(a)). These findings indicate an essential role for ALKBH8 in urothelial carcinoma cell survival mediated by NOX-1-dependent ROS signals, further suggesting new therapeutic strategies in human bladder cancer by inducing JNK/p38/gammaH2AX-mediated cell death by silencing of ALKBH8.",1
10823934,Specific interaction of CCR5 amino-terminal domain peptides containing sulfotyrosines with HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120,"The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 interacts consecutively with CD4 and the CCR5 coreceptor to mediate the entry of certain HIV-1 strains into target cells. Acidic residues and sulfotyrosines in the amino-terminal domain (Nt) of CCR5 are crucial for viral fusion and entry. We tested the binding of a panel of CCR5 Nt peptides to different soluble gp120/CD4 complexes and anti-CCR5 mAbs. The tyrosine residues in the peptides were sulfated, phosphorylated, or unmodified. None of the gp120/CD4 complexes associated with peptides containing unmodified or phosphorylated tyrosines. The gp120/CD4 complexes containing envelope glycoproteins from isolates that use CCR5 as a coreceptor associated with Nt peptides containing sulfotyrosines but not with peptides containing sulfotyrosines in scrambled Nt sequences. Finally, only peptides containing sulfotyrosines inhibited the entry of an R5 isolate. Our data show that proper posttranslational modification of the CCR5 Nt is required for gp120 binding and viral entry. More importantly, the Nt domain determines the specificity of the interaction between CCR5 and gp120s from isolates that use this coreceptor.",1
32775121,Acute Myocardial Infarction as Initial Manifestation of Acute Myeloid Leukemia: A Rare Manifestation of Leukostasis,"Leukostasis is a medical emergency caused by compromise of tissue perfusion secondary to hyperleukocytosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Typically it affects lungs and brain, with cardiac involvement being exceedingly rare. We present a case of AML presenting as acute coronary syndrome secondary to leukostasis-induced myocardial ischemia. A 43-year-old morbidly obese gentleman presented with typical anginal chest pain. On examination, he was diaphoretic and in acute distress secondary to pain. EKG revealed ST elevation in lead I and aVL and PR depressions in precordial leads. Troponin peaked at 5.55 ng/mL. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricle function with no wall motion abnormality. Blood work was notable for white blood cell (WBC) count of 185,200 cells/muL with 81% blasts. Coronary angiogram revealed no obstruction. Emergent leukapheresis and hydroxyurea were initiated. WBC count decreased to 48,200 cells/ muL and angina resolved after leukapheresis. With diagnosis of AML, he received 7+3 induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and idarubicin, followed by re-induction and consolidation chemotherapy. He subsequently underwent allogenic bone marrow transplantation and achieved complete remission. Hyperleukocytosis in AML can cause leukostasis, characterized by evidence of tissue ischemia. Coronary vasculature accounts for 6% of cases with leukostasis. This can manifest as myocardial infarction. Emergent and timely initiation of leukapheresis can potentially lead to a complete resolution of microvascular occlusion.",0
24186279,Short-term effects of nitrate on sucrose synthesis in wheat leaves,"Experiments were carried out with fully expanded leaves from three-week-old seedlings of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) raised without NO 3 (sup-) . Nitrate was supplied to the leaves through the transpiration stream in the light. Uptake of NO 3 (sup-) was linear with NO 3 (sup-) concentrations from 0 to 80 mM in the solution. Net sucrose synthesis showed inverse relationships versus nitrate uptake, assimilation, and accumulation, with correlation coefficients close to 1. By contrast, no alteration in sucrose synthesis was observed when KCl was substituted for KNO3 in the uptake solution. Sucrose synthesis was not affected by nitrate in seedlings treated with tungstate which absorbed but did not reduce NO 3 (sup-) . After 10 h, the final amount of sucrose in the tissues was only slightly decreased in the presence of NO 3 (sup-) , indicating that the effect of NO 3 (sup-) did not result from an altered sucrose-storage capacity. Comparison of the carbon skeleton and energy reductant necessary for NO 3 (sup-) and CO2 assimilation is consistent with the hypothesis that the processes of NO 3 (sup-) assimilation and sucrose synthesis compete for photosynthetic energy and carbon.

812414,Observations on the primate hyoepiglottic complex,"In the species presented, the orifice to the subhyoid air sac is found at the tuberculum (when the epiglottis attaches at the level of the ventricle); here also is noted the presence of a cartilaginous island(s) just anterior to the duct. When seen in coronal section along the axis of the duct, the glandular elements cluster around the sac in the anterior supraglottic subhyoid wedge, in preference to the area around the ventricles.",0
17116881,Apoptosis-inducing factor mediates poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymer-induced cell death,"Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), a mitochondrial oxidoreductase, is released into the cytoplasm to induce cell death in response to poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation. How PARP-1 activation leads to AIF release is not known. Here we identify PAR polymer as a cell death signal that induces release of AIF. PAR polymer induces mitochondrial AIF release and translocation to the nucleus. PAR glycohydrolase, which degrades PAR polymer, prevents PARP-1-dependent AIF release. Cells with reduced levels of AIF are resistant to PARP-1-dependent cell death and PAR polymer cytotoxicity. These results reveal PAR polymer as an AIF-releasing factor that plays important roles in PARP-1-dependent cell death.",1

Toe syndactyly, telecanthus and anogenital and renal malformations were present in all affected individuals; thus, we propose the name 'STAR syndrome' for this disorder. Using array CGH, qPCR and sequence analysis, we found causative mutations in FAM58A on Xq28 in all affected individuals, suggesting an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern for this recognizable syndrome.",1
8513140,Delayed production of nitric oxide contributes to NMDA-mediated neuronal damage,"Exposure of primary murine cortical neuron cultures to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) resulted in neuronal death as evidenced by release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the media. The addition of N-nitro-L-arginine (N-Arg) protected the neurons from death in a concentration-dependent manner when added after the NMDA, but not when the N-Arg was present with the NMDA. Protection by N-Arg was lost if L-arginine containing media was added to the cultures prior to the addition of the N-Arg. Treatment of the neurons with kainate prior to NMDA reduced subsequent NMDA-induced damage which was not prevented with N-Arg. These results suggest that delayed production of nitric oxide (NO) contributes to NMDA-induced neuronal damage in culture.",0

4531018,On the mechanism of pyridoxine responsive homocystinuria. II. Properties of normal and mutant cystathionine beta-synthase from cultured fibroblasts,"Cystathionine beta-synthase [L-serine hydrolyase (adding homocysteine), EC 4.2.1.22] was studied in cultured skin fibroblasts from two control subjects and three patients with pyridoxine-responsive homocystinuria. In crude cell sonicates, cystathionine synthase activity detected in each mutant line was less than 5% of control values. After differential centrifugation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and calcium phosphate gel treatment, the specific activity of synthase from control lines increased 5- to 7-fold with 70-79% yield. These same steps led to only 2- to 3-fold purification of mutant synthase and a reduced yield (26-44%). Michaelis-Menten analyses with the partially purified enzyme revealed that each mutant synthase had a marked reduction in affinity for its coenzyme, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, as well as reduced affinity and maximum velocity for both co-substrates, L-homocysteine and L-serine. Even at saturating concentrations of coenzyme, mutant synthase activity was less than 3% of control. Mutant synthase was also far more thermolabile than control enzyme. In the absence of added coenzyme, heating for 10 min at 55 degrees led to complete loss of mutant activity whereas control activity was reduced by 60%. Significantly, addition of saturating concentration of coenzyme prior to heating increased thermostability of both control and mutant synthase, the fractional increase being considerably greater in the mutants. We conclude that these patients suffer from a mutation of the synthase apoenzyme which impairs coenzyme binding, and that this primary abnormality results in reduced total enzyme activity in two ways: by reducing holoenzyme formation; and by accelerating apoenzyme degradation. We propose that pharmacologic amounts of pyridoxine increase holoenzyme formation modestly, thereby enhancing catalytic activity and slowing apoenzyme turnover.",1
17386017,Expression levels of growth-regulating imprinted genes in cloned piglets,"Different from cloned sheep, mice, and cattle, which are often born with increased body weights, pigs produced through nuclear transfer have not been found to be overly large compared to their age-matched controls. In our study, cloned pigs were significantly smaller than controls of conventional reproduction (p < 0.05) in both the deceased newborn group (1.2 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.2 kg) and at 1 month of age (6.1 +/- 1.3 vs. 8.0 +/- 0.8 kg, mean +/- SD). Because imprinted genes are important regulators of fetal growth and may be subjected to faulty reprogramming during nuclear transfer, we aimed to determine the expression levels of both growth-enhancing and growth-inhibiting imprinted genes in these cloned pigs by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These genes include IGF2 and PEG3 (growth-promoting), as well as IGF2R and GRB10 (growth-inhibiting). Tissues from six major organs including heart, lung, liver, kidney, brain, and spleen were collected from clones and controls of both age groups. With the exception of IGF2, significant differences in the expression levels of the other three imprinted genes were found in certain organs of either group of cloned pigs when compared to their age-matched controls. However, no strong correlation was found between the levels of gene expression and the low-body-weight phenotype of these cloned pigs. Interestingly, larger variances of gene expression were found in identical clones at 1 month old when compared to the control animals, indicating the variability of the nuclear reprogramming process.",0
16682970,"Mutations in CEP290, which encodes a centrosomal protein, cause pleiotropic forms of Joubert syndrome","Joubert syndrome-related disorders (JSRD) are a group of syndromes sharing the neuroradiological features of cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and a peculiar brainstem malformation known as the 'molar tooth sign'. We identified mutations in the CEP290 gene in five families with variable neurological, retinal and renal manifestations. CEP290 expression was detected mostly in proliferating cerebellar granule neuron populations and showed centrosome and ciliary localization, linking JSRDs to other human ciliopathies.",1
15023809,Increased risk for Alzheimer disease with the interaction of MPO and A2M polymorphisms,"BACKGROUND: The genes encoding myeloperoxidase (MPO) and alpha(2)-macroglobulin (A2M) are involved in molecular pathways leading to beta-amyloid deposition. Two polymorphic sites in these genes (MPO-G/A and A2M-Ile/Val) have been associated with Alzheimer disease (AD), but conflicting findings have been reported in populations with different ethnic backgrounds. OBJECTIVES: To study the association of MPO-G/A and A2M-Ile/Val polymorphisms with sporadic AD and to investigate the interactions among the MPO, A2M, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene polymorphisms in determining the risk of the development of AD. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Referral center for AD in Calabria, southern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-eight patients with sporadic AD and 158 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: The MPO-G and A2M-Val alleles were found more frequently in cases than in controls, as were the MPO-G/G and A2M-Val/Val genotypes. The odds ratio (OR) for the MPO-G/G genotype was 1.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-2.80); for the A2M-Val/Val genotype, 3.81 (95% CI, 1.66-8.75). The presence of MPO-G/G and A2M-Val/Val genotypes synergistically increased the risk of AD (OR, 25.5; 95% CI, 4.65-139.75). Stratification of cases by sex, age at onset of AD, and APOE-epsilon 4 status did not show significant differences in the distribution of MPO or A2M polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: The MPO and A2M polymorphisms are associated with sporadic AD in southern Italy. Moreover, a genomic interaction between these polymorphisms increases the risk of the development of AD.",1

27265783,Increased neuroplasticity and hippocampal microglia activation in a mice model of rapid antidepressant treatment,"The search for biomarkers of antidepressant effects focused on pathways regulating synaptic plasticity, and on activated inflammatory markers. Repeated Sleep Deprivation (SD) provides a model treatment to reverse-translate antidepressant effects from in vivo clinical psychiatry to model organisms. We studied the effects of repeated SD alone (ASD) or combined with exercise on a slow spinning wheel (SSW), in 116 C57BL/6J male mice divided in three groups (ASD, SSW, untreated). Forced Swimming Test (FST) was used to detect antidepressant-like effects. Unbiased evaluation of the transcriptional responses were obtained in the hippocampus by Illumina Bead Chip Array system, then confirmed with real time PCR. Spine densities in granular neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG) were assayed by standard Golgi staining. Activation of Microglial/Macrophages cells was evaluated by immunufluorescence analysis for Iba1. Rates of cell proliferation was estimated pulsing mice with the S-phase tracer 5-Iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IdU). All SD procedures caused a decreasing of floating time at FST, and increased expression of the immediate early gene Arc/Arg3.1. In addition, SSW also increased expression of the Microglia/Macrophages genes Iba-1 and chemokine receptors Cx3cR1 and CxcR4, of the canonical Wnt signaling gene Wnt7a, and of dendritic spines in CA4 neurons of the DG. SSW up-regulated both the number of Iba1+ cells and rates of cell proliferation in the subgranular region of the DG. The antidepressant-like effects of SD dissociated both, from hippocampal neuroplasticity in the DG (not occurring after ASD), and from microglial activation (not preventing behavioral response when occurring). The increase in dendritic spine density in the DG after SD and exercise was associated with an up-regulation of Wnt 7a, and with activation of the innate immune system of the brain. Increased Arc/Arg3.1 suggests however increased neuroplasticity, which could be common to all fast-acting antidepressants, and possibly occurring in other brain areas.",0
10208884,Effect of the method of capture on the haematology and blood chemistry of red deer (Cervus elaphus),"Haematological and plasma biochemical constituents can be affected during capture and handling operations in wildlife. The present study compares the blood constituents of 40 red deer (Cervus elaphus) captured using two different methods: 20 were captured by physical means, using long nets and box traps, and 20 by chemical means, using a mixture of xylazine and ketamine. Significant differences were found in the haemogram: red blood cell count, packed cell volume, haemoglobin concentration, and segmented neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte and total leukocyte counts were higher in animals captured by physical means. Conversely, the eosinophil count was higher in deer captured using anaesthetic. The plasma activity of alanine amino transferase, and the concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, albumin, alpha-2 globulins, total proteins, sodium and chloride, were significantly higher in the group captured by physical means. With the exception of the eosinophil count, all the blood constituents which presented higher values were in the group of physically captured deer, and thus it is necessary to take into account the method of capture when interpretation or establishment of reference values is performed.",0
11159934,Transgenic mice expressing mutant caveolin-3 show severe myopathy associated with increased nNOS activity,"Caveolin-3 is the muscle-specific isoform of the caveolin protein family, which is a major component of caveolae, small membrane invaginations found in most cell types. Caveolins play important roles in the formation of caveola membranes, acting as scaffolding proteins to organize and concentrate lipid-modified signaling molecules, and modulate a signaling pathway. For instance, caveolin-3 interacts with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and inhibits its catalytic activity. Recently, specific mutations in the caveolin-3 gene, including the Pro104Leu missense mutation, have been shown to cause an autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD1C), which is characterized by the deficiency of caveolin-3 in the sarcolemma. However, the molecular mechanism by which these mutations cause the deficiency of caveolin-3 and muscle cell degeneration remains elusive. Here we generated transgenic mice expressing the Pro104Leu mutant caveolin-3. They showed severe myopathy accompanied by the deficiency of caveolin-3 in the sarcolemma, indicating a dominant negative effect of mutant caveolin-3. Interestingly, we also found a great increase of nNOS activity in their skeletal muscle, which, we propose, may play a role in muscle fiber degeneration in caveolin-3 deficiency.",1
28309347,The flow of copper through a terrestrial food chain : II. Factors influencing the copper content of isopods,"1) In terrestrial isopods total copper concentration increases exponentially with size, the exponentb in the equationy=a.x (b) being larger in populations rich in copper than in populations poor in copper. 2) However, immediately after hatching all species so far tested in Tirol contain the same amount, i.e., approximately 0.13 mug Cu per mg dry weight. 3) A very close correlation (r=0.98) exists between the mean copper concentrations of isopods and litter, from a series of habitats ranging widely in their copper content. The correlation with the copper concentration of the soil is much less clearly expressed. 4) In isopods kept in culture and fed litter from their original habitats the concentration of copper increases. This increase is almost entirely due to an elevation of the copper content of the hepatopancreas. 5) Feeding a low-copper diet to a high-copper population for four weeks did not alter significantly the mean copper concentration of the animals. 6) There is a marked temperature-dependent seasonal fluctuation in the copper content of isopods, with a maximum in winter and a minium in summer. 7) On the basis of dry weight the concentration factor for copper is about six, the same as that for cadmium in another species of isopod studied by Martin et al. (1976) in England, and much higher than the concentration factors for the same metals by pulmonate snails.",0

26651852,A Mixed-Methods Pilot Study of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for HIV-Associated Chronic Pain,"Treatment guidelines for chronic pain recommend nonpharmacologic modalities as part of a comprehensive management plan. Chronic pain is common among people living with HIV/AIDS, but there is little data to guide the choice of nonpharmacologic therapies in this complex population. We performed a mixed-methods feasibility study of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) versus health education control with 32 inner city, HIV-infected participants. Outcome measures included: the Brief Pain Inventory, Perceived Stress Scale, HIV Symptoms Index, autonomic function testing, and audiotaped focus groups. Post-intervention, participants reported modest improvements in pain measures and perceived stress, but no effect of group assignment was observed. At 3-month follow-up, 79% of MBSR participants were still practicing, and pain intensity was improved, whereas in the control group pain intensity had worsened. Qualitative analysis revealed a strong sense of community in both groups, but only MBSR was perceived as useful for relaxation and pain relief.",0
15708823,Serological diagnosis of enzootic pneumonia of swine by a double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a monoclonal antibody and recombinant antigen (P46) of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae,"To facilitate the control of enzootic pneumonia (EP) of swine caused by Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, the complement fixation (CF) test has been used for the detection of M. hyopneumoniae antibodies. However, the CF test is a cumbersome and time-consuming technique and cross-reactivity are major drawbacks associated with this method. To circumvent these drawbacks, we have developed a double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), consisting of purified monoclonal antibody (Mab) against the 46 kDa surface antigen (P46) of M. hyopneumoniae and recombinant P46 protein expressed in Escherichia coli, for the detection of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae in serum samples from pigs experimentally inoculated with M. hyopneumoniae and from naturally infected pigs, and compared the practical usefulness of ELISA using the CF test. In experimentally inoculated pigs, the CF and ELISA antibodies were detected at almost the same time, and a good correlation was demonstrated between the CF test and the ELISA. In a survey conducted on field samples, the seropositivity by ELISA in pigs of age 2-6 months was increased. At the time of slaughter, approximately 80% of the animals were seropositive for ELISA. However, a gradual decrease in the prevalence of ELISA positive samples was observed in sows with increasing parity. No correlation was seen between the results obtained with the two methods in the clinical samples. The CF test appears to have limited value for the diagnosis of EP in conventional herds because nonspecific reactions were frequently observed. Therefore, this ELISA is a useful alternative to the CF test currently used for the diagnosis of EP.",0

12189162,A mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy,"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset motor neuron disease, caused by the expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (TNR) in exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. This disorder is characterized by degeneration of motor and sensory neurons, proximal muscular atrophy, and endocrine abnormalities, such as gynecomastia and reduced fertility. We describe the development of a transgenic model of SBMA expressing a full-length human AR (hAR) cDNA carrying 65 (AR(65)) or 120 CAG repeats (AR(120)), with widespread expression driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Mice carrying the AR(120) transgene displayed behavioral and motor dysfunction, while mice carrying 65 CAG repeats showed a mild phenotype. Progressive muscle weakness and atrophy was observed in AR(120) mice and was associated with the loss of alpha-motor neurons in the spinal cord. There was no evidence of neurodegeneration in other brain structures. Motor dysfunction was observed in both male and female animals, showing that in SBMA the polyglutamine repeat expansion causes a dominant gain-of-function mutation in the AR. The male mice displayed a progressive reduction in sperm production consistent with testis defects reported in human patients. These mice represent the first model to reproduce the key features of SBMA, making them a useful resource for characterizing disease progression, and for testing therapeutic strategies for both polyglutamine and motor neuron diseases.",1
9263585,Influence of the neuropeptide somatostatin on the development of dendritic morphology: a cysteamine-depletion study in the rat auditory brainstem,"We investigated the functional role of somatostatin during early ontogeny of the brain, when the neuropeptide as well as its receptors are heavily expressed in the auditory brainstem. Rat pups received a daily injection of cysteamine which, when applied at low concentrations, most selectively depletes somatostatin. Neurons from the lateral superior olive, an auditory brainstem nucleus which transiently receives a dense somatostatinergic input, were intracellularly labeled at postnatal day 14 or 18. The dendritic morphology of these neurons was then analyzed quantitatively and compared with neurons from controls. Cysteamine treatment induced a reduction of the number of dendritic end points by more than 50%. At postnatal day 14, for example, controls and somatostatin-depleted animals had an average of 58 and 28 end points, respectively. The number of primary dendrites was also significantly reduced by cysteamine. In contrast, the size of the somata, the orientation of the dendritic trees within the lateral superior olive, the dendritic areas, and the cross-sectional size of the lateral superior olive were not altered. These results indicate that somatostatin depletion during early development has profound effects on the maturation of dendritic morphology. The selective influence on the dendritic trees suggests that somatostatin acts as an endogenous trophic peptide and promotes the achievement of dendritic complexity.",0

19784724,Intussusception in adult and pediatric patients: two different entities,"PURPOSE: Intussusception is one of the most common abdominal emergencies in pediatrics, but adult intussusception is an uncommon entity and most surgeons have only limited experience in treating this disease. The purpose of this study was to highlight the differences between pediatric and adult intussusception. METHODS: The records of 40 patients during 14 years were reviewed retrospectively. The symptoms, diagnosis, sites of intussusception, associated pathologies, and treatment methods of each patient were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 31 pediatric and 9 adult patients were included in the study. In the pediatric group, bloody stool and vomiting were the most common symptoms whereas adult patients commonly presented with abdominal pain. The physical examination was diagnostic in a remarkable proportion of the pediatric patients but the diagnosis was suggested based on imaging techniques in the adults, and preoperative diagnosis was more successful in the pediatric group. Intussusception was more often associated with an underlying pathology in adults and no adult patient underwent nonoperative reduction, whereas pediatric patients were managed either with hydrostatic reduction or surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although intussusceptions occur at all ages, there are major differences in the clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, and management between pediatric and adult populations. Intussusception is remarkably different in these two age groups and it must be approached from a different clinical perspective.",0
2251268,Molecular characterization of inherited medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,"Deficiency of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) is a common inherited defect in energy metabolism. Characterization of the mRNA encoding MCAD in a Dutch MCAD-deficient patient revealed an A----G change at nucleotide position 985 of the MCAD mRNA coding region. This point mutation results in the substitution of a glutamic acid for a lysine at amino acid position 304 of the mature protein. The single base change was not found in any wild-type MCAD mRNAs. A mutant allele-specific oligonucleotide probe was used in a hybridization analysis of amplified genomic DNA of MCAD-deficient family members, a carrier, and normal individuals. The hybridization analysis specifically identified individuals who were heterozygotes or homozygotes. In addition to the point mutation, a significant proportion of the index patient's MCAD mRNA contained a variety of deletions and insertions as a result of exon skipping and intron retention. The missplicing occurred in multiple regions throughout the MCAD mRNA. Analysis of the patient's MCAD gene in the regions where the missplicing occurred most frequently did not reveal a mutation in the splicing acceptor or donor sites. Therefore, the molecular characterization of this family revealed a crucial point mutation in the MCAD gene and an unusual abnormality in MCAD pre-mRNA splicing.",1
31388428,Flexible resource use strategies of a central-place forager experiencing dynamic risk and opportunity,"Background: Movement decisions made in space and time define how wildlife meet competing extrinsic and intrinsic demands to maximize fitness. Differential selection of resource patches provides one example of how to measure how animals balance conflicting demands. We hypothesized that individual spatial selection of patch types between dynamic seasons would signify flexible strategies used to minimize risk and optimize foraging efforts. Methods: We used data collected from GPS loggers on golden-mantled ground squirrels (Callospermophilus lateralis) to model selection or avoidance of resources in two seasons of seed availability and one season in which no seeds were available. Movement decisions were measured in short-term discrete time intervals using high resolution location data. Selection or avoidance of specific resource features that entail fitness consequences were then assessed using resource selection functions. Results: Seasonality of food availability, food type, and spatial distribution of food largely influenced how individuals selected resources within their home ranges. Overall, when seeds were available, individuals mediated risks of predation and loss of food by using patches closer to refuge and selected intermediate distances to the burrow. When food was not available, individuals minimized exposure to heightened risk by staying close to the burrow and avoiding riskier patch types. Conclusions: Results indicate that individuals used flexible, dynamic strategies to select habitat patches which may allow them to balance conflicting seasonal demands. Advances in GPS technology for research of small mammals provide greater insight into how prey species in high risk environments differentially use resources to minimize risk and maintain fitness.",0
22593606,Biological Removal of Azo and Triphenylmethane Dyes and Toxicity of Process By-Products,"Increasing environmental pollution is connected with broad applications of dyes and imperfection of dyeing technology. Decolourization of triphenylmethane brilliant green and disazo Evans blue by bacterial and fungal strains and toxicity (phyto- and zootoxicity) of degradation by-products were investigated. Influence of incubation method on dyes removal was evaluated (static, semi-static, shaken). Dead biomass was used for sorption estimation. Toxicity of treated dyes was measured to estimate possible influence on aquatic ecosystems. The zootoxicity test was done with Daphnia magna and phytotoxicity with Lemna minor. Samples were classified according to ACE 89/BE 2/D3 Final Report Commission EC. The best results of removal for all tested strains were reached in shaken samples. In opposite to fungi, bacterial strains decolourized brilliant green more effectively than Evans blue. The most effective bacterial strain was Erwinia spp. (s12) and fungal strains were Polyporus picipes (RWP17) and Pleurotus ostreatus (BWPH and MB). Decolourization of brilliant green was connected with decrease of zootoxicity (D. magna) and phytotoxicity (L. minor). Removal of Evans blue was connected with no changes in zootoxicity and decrease of phytotoxicity in most of samples.",0
1083546,Abnormal pulmonary gallium accumulation in P. carinii pneumonia,The potentially fatal interstitial pneumonia of Pneumocystis carinii is a frequent opportunistic invader of patients treated for malignancy with immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents. Generalized Ga-67 pulmonary localization which is markedly disproportionate to the clinical and radiographic findings has led to earlier diagnoses by open lung biopsy in this setting. The potential usefulness of gallium scintigraphy in patients with suspected P. Carini pneumonia is presented.,0
31681962,Psychological well-being of identity-release egg donation parents with infants,"STUDY QUESTION: What are the psychological health, relationship quality and perceived social support outcomes of heterosexual couples who have conceived an infant through identity-release egg donation? SUMMARY ANSWER: Parents' scores on all measures were within the normal range. Egg donation mothers had poorer perceived social support, and egg donation fathers had less optimal psychological health than a comparison group of IVF parents, although these differences were associated with the older age of egg donation parents, rather than being an effect of family type. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: There is limited understanding of the psychological health and couple relationship quality of egg donation parents, and no empirical data on parents' social support, during the first year of parenthood. No studies have included families who have used an identity-release egg donor. The study offers the first examination of the psychological well-being of identity-release egg donation parents. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study included 57 families created through identity-release egg donation, and a comparison group of 56 families who had used IVF with their own gametes, recruited through UK fertility clinics. Families were visited at home between October 2013 and June 2015. The sample forms part of a larger study examining family functioning in families created following fertility treatment. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHOD: All families were heterosexual two-parent families with an infant aged 6-18 months. Mothers and fathers were administered standardised questionnaires assessing psychological health (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Trait Anxiety Inventory and Parenting Stress Index-short form), couple relationship quality (Golombok Rust Inventory of Marital State) and perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Scores from the egg donation and IVF parents were within the normal range on all measures. Significant differences were found between the groups indicating less optimal social support in egg donation mothers compared to IVF mothers, and poorer psychological health in egg donation fathers compared to IVF fathers. These differences appeared to be related to the older age of egg donation parents or to twin parenthood, rather than to egg donation per se. No differences were found between the groups in the parents' relationship quality. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: It is possible that families who were managing the transition to parenthood less well may have been less likely to participate in research. Fewer IVF than egg donation fathers participated in the study, so the statistical power was lower for comparisons between fathers. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The findings are of relevance to UK clinics offering identity-release egg donation. That scores of egg donation parents on measures of psychological well-being were more similar than different to those of IVF parents should prove reassuring to individuals considering this treatment type. As less optimal outcomes were found for egg donation parents on several measures, and these were associated with parental age rather than conception type, it is recommended that clinics discuss with older patients how they may establish a social support network and signpost patients to appropriate post-natal support. STUDY FUNDING, COMPETING INTERESTS: This research was supported by a Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator Award [097857/Z/11/Z] and a CHESS-ESRC studentship. The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: N/A.",0
15239083,Characterization of mutations in ATP8B1 associated with hereditary cholestasis,"Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) are clinically distinct hereditary disorders. PFIC patients suffer from chronic cholestasis and develop liver fibrosis. BRIC patients experience intermittent attacks of cholestasis that resolve spontaneously. Mutations in ATP8B1 (previously FIC1) may result in PFIC or BRIC. We report the genomic organization of ATP8B1 and mutation analyses of 180 families with PFIC or BRIC that identified 54 distinct disease mutations, including 10 mutations predicted to disrupt splicing, 6 nonsense mutations, 11 small insertion or deletion mutations predicted to induce frameshifts, 1 large genomic deletion, 2 small inframe deletions, and 24 missense mutations. Most mutations are rare, occurring in 1-3 families, or are limited to specific populations. Many patients are compound heterozygous for 2 mutations. Mutation type or location correlates overall with clinical severity: missense mutations are more common in BRIC (58% vs. 38% in PFIC), while nonsense, frameshifting, and large deletion mutations are more common in PFIC (41% vs. 16% in BRIC). Some mutations, however, lead to a wide range of phenotypes, from PFIC to BRIC or even no clinical disease. ATP8B1 mutations were detected in 30% and 41%, respectively, of the PFIC and BRIC patients screened.",1
25204729,Enhanced repellency of binary mixtures of Calophyllum inophyllum nut oil fatty acids or their esters and three terpenoids to Stomoxys calcitrans,"BACKGROUND: An assessment was made of the repellency to female stable flies of tamanu nut oil fatty acids or their esters alone (each 0.5 mg cm(-2) ) or in combination with cuminyl alcohol, cuminaldehyde and alpha-phellandrene (each 0.25 mg cm(-2) ), using an exposed human hand bioassay. Results were compared with those of synthetic repellent DEET (0.25 mg cm(-2) ). RESULTS: Based upon protection time (PT) (time to first bite of stable fly), oleic acid, linoleic acid, methyl oleate or methyl linoleate synergised the repellency of each monoterpenoid and DEET. For example, the binary mixture of oleic acid and cuminyl alcohol (PT 2.05 h) resulted in significantly greater repellency than either oleic acid (0.55 h), cuminyl alcohol (0.70 h) or DEET alone (1.50 h). The binary mixtures of oleic acid and cuminyl alcohol or DEET (PT 2.10 h) did not differ significantly in repellency. The structure-activity relationship indicates that the degree of saturation, the side chain length and the functional group of fatty acids appear to play a role in determining the fatty acid repellency to stable flies. CONCLUSION: Mixtures formulated from fatty acid and monoterpenoid could be useful as potential repellents for protecting humans and possibly domestic animals from bites caused by stable fly.",0
20723301,Influence of dipyridamole on expression of PAC-1 and CD62p in patients with malignant lymphoma,"This study was purposed to explore the expressions of platelet-activated markers PAC-1 and CD62p in peripheral blood of malignant lymphoma patients and the influence of dipyridamole on their expression. 32 lymphoma patients were divided into simple chemotherapy group (simple group) and chemotherapy plus dipyridamole group (combined group) randomly, and 15 healthy peoples were selected as control group. The dipyridamole of 100 mg/day was given to the patients in combined group. The expression levels of PAC-1, CD62p and fibrinogen (Fib) were detected by flow cytometry and magnetic bead method on day 0, 3, 7 and 14 of chemotherapy respectively. The results showed that the levels of PAC-1, CD62p and Fib in lymphoma patients were significantly higher than those in control group (p < 0.01, 0.05), moreover there was positive correlation between levels of PAC-1 and Fib (r = 0.549, p < 0.01). PAC-1 expression on day 0 and 3 of chemotherapy in simple group was higher than that on day 14 (p < 0.05, 0.01) and CD62p expression on day 3 of chemotherapy was higher than that on day 0, 7 and 14 (p < 0.05, 0.01). PAC-1 expression in combined group on day 14 of chemotherapy was lower than than on day 0 and 3 (p < 0.05, 0.01), and CD62p on day 14 was lower than that on day 3 of chemotherapy (p < 0.05); PAC-1 and CD62p expressions in combined group on day 3, 7 and 14 of chemotherapy were decreased than those in simple group, but Fib level was not changed significantly. It is concluded that the patients with malignant lymphoma usually accompany with platelet activation and hyperfibrinogenemia in peripheral blood. Applying dipyridamole routine dosage in chemotherapy can efficiently restrain platelet activation.",0

12970760,Caspase-3 regulates cell cycle in B cells: a consequence of substrate specificity,"Caspases are important for apoptosis but are also involved in mammalian cell survival and cell division. Here we report that caspase-3 is a negative regulator of B cell cycling. Mice deficient in caspase-3 (Casp3-/- mice) have increased numbers of splenic B cells that show normal apoptosis but enhanced proliferation in vivo and hyperproliferation after mitogenic stimulation in vitro. Cdkn1a encodes p21 (also called Waf1 or Cip1), a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. Although expression of p21 was increased, CDK activities and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were increased in Casp3-/- B cells. Using Casp3-/-Cdkn1a-/- mice, we show that the hyperproliferation of Casp3-/- B cells is abolished when Cdkn1a is also deleted. Our genetic and biochemical data demonstrate that caspase-3 is essential in the regulation of B cell homeostasis.",1
28954833,Reactive oxygen species signalling in the diabetic heart: emerging prospect for therapeutic targeting,"Despite being first described 45 years ago, the existence of a distinct diabetic cardiomyopathy remains controversial. Nonetheless, it is widely accepted that the diabetic heart undergoes characteristic structural and functional changes in the absence of ischaemia and hypertension, which are independently linked to heart failure progression and are likely to underlie enhanced susceptibility to stress. A prominent feature is marked collagen accumulation linked with inflammation and extensive extracellular matrix changes, which appears to be the main factor underlying cardiac stiffness and subclinical diastolic dysfunction, estimated to occur in as many as 75% of optimally controlled diabetics. Whether this characteristic remodelling phenotype is primarily driven by microvascular dysfunction or alterations in cardiomyocyte metabolism remains unclear. Although hyperglycaemia regulates multiple pathways in the diabetic heart, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is thought to represent a central mechanism underlying associated adverse remodelling. Indeed, experimental and clinical diabetes are linked with oxidative stress which plays a key role in cardiomyopathy, while key processes underlying diabetic cardiac remodelling, such as inflammation, angiogenesis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis, fibrosis and contractile dysfunction, are redox sensitive. This review will explore the relative contributions of the major ROS sources (dysfunctional nitric oxide synthase, mitochondria, xanthine oxidase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases) in the diabetic heart and the potential for therapeutic targeting of ROS signalling using novel pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to modify specific aspects of the remodelling phenotype in order to prevent and/or delay heart failure development and progression.",0
12697998,"The human ATP binding cassette gene ABCA13, located on chromosome 7p12.3, encodes a 5058 amino acid protein with an extracellular domain encoded in part by a 4.8-kb conserved exon","The ABCA subfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters includes eleven members to date. In this study, we describe a new, unusually large gene on chromosome 7p12.3, ABCA13. This gene spans over 450 kb and is split into 62 exons. The predicted ABCA13 protein consists of 5,058 ami- no acid residues making it the largest ABC protein described to date. Like the other ABCA subfamily members, ABCA13 contains a hydrophobic, predicted transmembrane segment at the N-terminus, followed by a large hydrophilic region. In the case of ABCA13, the hydrophilic region is unexpectedly large, more than 3,500 amino acids, encoded by 30 exons, two of which are 4.8 and 1.7 kb in length. These two large exons are adjacent to each other and are conserved in the mouse Abca13 gene. Tissue profiling of the major transcript reveals the highest expression in human trachea, testis, and bone marrow. The expression of the gene was also determined in 60 tumor cell lines and the highest expression was detected in the SR leukemia, SNB-19 CNS tumor and DU-145 prostate tumor cell lines. ABCA13 has high similarity with other ABCA subfamily genes which are associated with human inherited diseases: ABCA1 with the cholesterol transport disorders Tangier disease and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia, and ABCA4 with several retinal degeneration disorders. The ABCA13 gene maps to chromosome 7p12.3, a region that contains an inherited disorder affecting the pancreas (Shwachman-Diamond syndrome) as well as a locus involved in T-cell tumor invasion and metastasis (INM7), and therefore is a positional candidate for these pathologies.",1
12556487,Haploinsufficiency of p18(INK4c) sensitizes mice to carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis,"The INK4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors negatively regulates cyclin D-dependent CDK4 and CDK6 and thereby retains the growth-suppressive function of Rb family proteins. Mutations in the CDK4 gene conferring INK4 resistance are associated with familial and sporadic melanoma in humans and result in a wide spectrum of tumors in mice. Whereas loss of function of other INK4 genes in mice leads to little or no tumor development, targeted deletion of p18(INK4c) causes spontaneous pituitary tumors and lymphoma late in life. Here we show that treatment of p18 null and heterozygous mice with a chemical carcinogen resulted in tumor development at an accelerated rate. The remaining wild-type allele of p18 was neither mutated nor silenced in tumors derived from heterozygotes. Hence, p18 is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in mice.",1
17686054,Constitutive Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 activation results in specific changes in gene expression in myeloid leukaemic cells,"Constitutively activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) play an important role in leukaemogenesis. We have examined, by cDNA microarray analysis, the changes in gene expression induced by FLT3/ITD or constitutively activated wild type FLT3 signalling. A limited set of genes was consistently affected by FLT3 inhibition. In confirmation of their FLT3 dependence, these genes returned toward pretreatment levels of expression after reversal of FLT3 inhibition. Several of the most significantly affected genes are involved in the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. These data suggest that constitutively activated FLT3 works through multiple signal transduction pathways. PIM1, MYC and CCND3 were chosen from this gene set to explore their biological roles. Knock-down of these genes by small interfering RNA showed that these genes play important roles in constitutively activated FLT3 expressing cells. The alterations of the gene expression profiles in these cells help to further elucidate the mechanisms of FLT3-mediated leukaemogenesis.",0
16048958,Establishment of a superficial skin infection model in mice by using Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes,"A new animal model for the purpose of studying superficial infections is presented. In this model an infection is established by disruption of the skin barrier by partial removal of the epidermal layer by tape stripping and subsequent application of the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The infection and the infection route are purely topical, in contrast to those used in previously described animal models in mice, such as the skin suture-wound model, where the infection is introduced into the deeper layers of the skin. Thus, the present model is considered more biologically relevant for the study of superficial skin infections in mice and humans. Established topical antibiotic treatments are shown to be effective. The procedures involved in the model are simple, a feature that increases throughput and reproducibility. This new model should be applicable to the evaluation of novel antimicrobial treatments of superficial infections caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes.",0
2427522,Purification and characterization of chlordecone reductase from human liver,"The toxic organochlorine pesticide, chlordecone (Kepone), is excreted in human bile primarily as a stable, reduced monoalcohol metabolite. This bioreduction is catalyzed by a hepatic cytosolic enzyme activity termed chlordecone reductase. We purified this enzyme from human liver and found that chlordecone reductase resembles the family of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes referred to as the aldo-keto reductases based on its biochemical characteristics, including its ability to catalyze the reduction of a carbonyl-containing substrate. However, analyses of liver cytosolic samples on immunoblots developed with anti-chlordecone reductase antibodies revealed that immunoreactive proteins were present only in those mammalian species that convert chlordecone to chlordecone alcohol in vivo (man, gerbil, and rabbit) and not in those species unable to reduce chlordecone (rat, mouse, and hamster). Hence, chlordecone reductase is unique among aldo-keto reductases in being species-specific. Quantitative immunoblot analyses of seven human liver specimens disclosed two immunoreactive proteins whose total concentration varied over a 6-fold range. Moreover, the amount of immunoreactive protein was directly proportional to chlordecone reductase activity in each sample. We conclude that chlordecone reductase is a unique aldo-keto reductase of potential clinical importance whose expression varies markedly among individuals.",1
20818085,Cardioprotection of adenosine treatment in cadaver donor rats with warm ischemia,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cardioprotection of adenosine treatment in cadaver donor rats with warm ischemia. METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into 7 groups. Group C was a control group. Group I(5), I(15), and I(30): The donor hearts from the cadaver rats that died of acute hemorrhagic shock and within warm ischemic durations of 5, 15, and 30 min, respectively, and the donor hearts were perfused with STH-1 for 30 min before cervical heterotopic heart transplantation. Group A(5), A(15), and A(30) were adenosine treatment groups and the donor hearts were obtained as mentioned above and perfused with STH-1 plus adenosine (adenosine concentration 1.2 mmol/L) before cervical heterotopic heart transplantation. We detected the change of the grafts including ultrastructure, the level of ATP, SOD, and MDA, NF-kappaB mRNA, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 24 h after the transplantation. RESULTS: At the same time point, compared with Group I(5), I(15), and I(30), Group A(5), A(15), and A(30) showed increased ATP and SOD in the myocardial tissues, and decreased MDA, NF-kappaB mRNA, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Adenosine treatment can protect the graft in cadaver donor rats with warm ischemia. The mechanism may improve the myocardial energy metabolism, attenuate lipid peroxidation injury, suppress the expression of NF-kappaB mRNA, and decrease the inflammatory damage of TNF-alpha and IL-6.",0
9751240,"Effects of energy and purines in the diet on proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in the small intestine of the pig","The effects of the energy and purine content in the diet on mucosal cell mitosis, function, and apoptosis in the small intestine of pigs were investigated in two experiments. In experiment I, three groups of five pigs were first fed a commercial diet that contained 9.1 MJ metabolizable energy (ME) per kilogram dry matter (DM) and 16.4% crude protein. It was followed by the experimental diets for 5 days each starting with an energy deficit (5.8 MJ ME/kg DM; 7% crude protein) followed by a high-energy diet with low purine content (14.1 MJ ME/kg DM; 13.6% crude protein; 460 mg purines/kg), or alternatively an isocaloric high-purine diet (2,160 mg purines/kg). During experimental periods, blood samples were drawn daily through catheters for insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) determination. The animals were killed at the end of the corresponding feeding period and gut tissue samples were collected. In tissue samples, IGF-I and parameters for the characterization of mitosis (thymidine kinase [TK], proliferating-cell nuclear antigen [PCNA]) and differentiation (RNA content, alkaline phosphatase, sucrase) were measured. The degree of apoptosis was determined histologically. In experiment II, five pigs were fitted with simple T-cannula at the distal jejunum. They were fed the three experimental diets consecutively for 7 days each and sucrase and alkaline phosphatase were measured in digesta (four samples daily). IGF-I in blood but not in tissue clearly responded to the energy content of the diet with a decrease during the deficit and an increase in the two high-energy groups. However, purines had no additional effect on IGF-I. TK, PCNA, and gut weight showed an energy effect on mitosis, which was paralleled by increased peripheral IGF-I. Purines led to a further increase of mitosis, but IGF-I and gut weight were not increased. The degree of mitosis was correlated with higher activities of sucrase and alkaline phosphatase and also with the number of apoptotic cells. The enzyme activity increased from the deficit to the high-energy group and was further elevated due to purines. The results from experiment II also confirm these effects of energy and purines, because the activities of the enzymes in digesta decreased during energy deficit, but increased due to energy and in addition to purines.",0
8980223,"Isolation of angiopoietin-1, a ligand for the TIE2 receptor, by secretion-trap expression cloning","TIE2 is a receptor-like tyrosine kinase expressed almost exclusively in endothelial cells and early hemopoietic cells and required for the normal development of vascular structures during embryogenesis. We report the identification of a secreted ligand for TIE2, termed Angiopoietin-1, using a novel expression cloning technique that involves intracellular trapping and detection of the ligand in COS cells. The structure of Angiopoietin-1 differs from that of known angiogenic factors or other ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases. Although Angiopoietin-1 binds and induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of TIE2, it does not directly promote the growth of cultured endothelial cells. However, its expression in close proximity with developing blood vessels implicates Angiopoietin-1 in endothelial developmental processes.",1
9892010,Somatostatin activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase via somatostatin receptor 1 (SSTR1),"Hormones and growth factors regulate cell growth via the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade. Here we examine the actions of the hormone somatostatin on the MAP kinase cascade through one of its two major receptor subtypes, the somatostatin receptor 1 (SSTR1) stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells. Somatostatin antagonizes the proliferative effects of fibroblast growth factor in CHO-SSTR1 cells via the SSTR1 receptor. However, in these cells, somatostatin robustly activates MAP kinase (also called extracellular signal regulated kinase; ERK) and augments fibroblast growth factor-stimulated ERK activity. We show that the activation of ERK via SSTR1 is pertussis toxin sensitive and requires the small G protein Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1, and the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. The activation of ERK by SSTR1 increased the expression of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor p21(cip1/WAF1). Previous studies have suggested that somatostatin-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphatase activity mediates the growth effects of somatostatin. Our data suggest that SHP-2 stimulation by SSTR1 may mediate some of these effects through the activation of the MAP kinase cascade and the expression of p21(cip1/WAF1).",0

Here we show by immunofluorescence microscopy and western-blot analysis that ABCR is present in foveal and peripheral cone, as well as rod, photoreceptors. Our results suggest that the loss in central vision experienced by Stargardt patients arises directly from ABCR-mediated foveal cone degeneration.",1
23532844,The Joubert syndrome-associated missense mutation (V443D) in the Abelson-helper integration site 1 (AHI1) protein alters its localization and protein-protein interactions,"BACKGROUND: Missense mutations in AHI1 result in the neurodevelopmental ciliopathy called Joubert syndrome. RESULTS: Mutations in AHI1 decrease cilia formation, alter its localization and stability, and change its binding to HAP1 and NPHP1. CONCLUSION: Mutations in AHI1 affect ciliogenesis, AHI1 protein localization, and AHI1-protein interactions. SIGNIFICANCE: This study begins to describe how missense mutations in AHI1 can cause Joubert syndrome. Mutations in AHI1 cause Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a neurodevelopmental ciliopathy, characterized by midbrain-hindbrain malformations and motor/cognitive deficits. Here, we show that primary cilia (PC) formation is decreased in fibroblasts from individuals with JBTS and AHI1 mutations. Most missense mutations in AHI1, causing JBTS, occur in known protein domains, however, a common V443D mutation in AHI1 is found in a region with no known protein motifs. We show that cells transfected with AHI1-V443D, or a new JBTS-causing mutation, AHI1-R351L, have aberrant localization of AHI1 at the basal bodies of PC and at cell-cell junctions, likely through decreased binding of mutant AHI1 to NPHP1 (another JBTS-causing protein). The AHI1-V443D mutation causes decreased AHI1 stability because there is a 50% reduction in AHI1-V443D protein levels compared with wild type AHI1. Huntingtin-associated protein-1 (Hap1) is a regulatory protein that binds Ahi1, and Hap1 knock-out mice have been reported to have JBTS-like phenotypes, suggesting a role for Hap1 in ciliogenesis. Fibroblasts and neurons with Hap1 deficiency form PC with normal growth factor-induced ciliary signaling, indicating that the Hap1 JBTS phenotype is likely not through effects at PC. These results also suggest that the binding of Ahi1 and Hap1 may not be critical for ciliary function. However, we show that HAP1 has decreased binding to AHI1-V443D indicating that this altered binding could be responsible for the JBTS-like phenotype through an unknown pathway. Thus, these JBTS-associated missense mutations alter their subcellular distribution and protein interactions, compromising functions of AHI1 in cell polarity and cilium-mediated signaling, thereby contributing to JBTS.",1

31025714,Interventions for hand eczema,"BACKGROUND: Hand eczema is an inflammation of the skin of the hands that tends to run a chronic, relapsing course. This common condition is often associated with itch, social stigma, and impairment in employment. Many different interventions of unknown effectiveness are used to treat hand eczema. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of topical and systemic interventions for hand eczema in adults and children. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following up to April 2018: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, LILACS, GREAT, and four trials registries. We checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared interventions for hand eczema, regardless of hand eczema type and other affected sites, versus no treatment, placebo, vehicle, or active treatments. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were participant- and investigator-rated good/excellent control of symptoms, and adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included 60 RCTs, conducted in secondary care (5469 participants with mild to severe chronic hand eczema). Most participants were over 18 years old. The duration of treatment was short, generally up to four months. Only 24 studies included a follow-up period. Clinical heterogeneity in treatments and outcome measures was evident. Few studies performed head-to-head comparisons of different interventions. Risk of bias varied considerably, with only five studies at low risk in all domains. Twenty-two studies were industry-funded.Eighteen trials studied topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors; 10 studies, phototherapy; three studies, systemic immunosuppressives; and five studies, oral retinoids. Most studies compared an active intervention against no treatment, variants of the same medication, or placebo (or vehicle). Below, we present results from the main comparisons.Corticosteroid creams/ointments: when assessed 15 days after the start of treatment, clobetasol propionate 0.05% foam probably improves participant-rated control of symptoms compared to vehicle (risk ratio (RR) 2.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38 to 3.91; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3, 95% CI 2 to 8; 1 study, 125 participants); the effect of clobetasol compared to vehicle for investigator-rated improvement is less clear (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.40). More participants had at least one adverse event with clobetasol (11/62 versus 5/63; RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.82 to 6.06), including application site burning/pruritus. This evidence was rated as moderate certainty.When assessed 36 weeks after the start of treatment, mometasone furoate cream used thrice weekly may slightly improve investigator-rated symptom control compared to twice weekly (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.61; 1 study, 72 participants) after remission is reached. Participant-rated symptoms were not measured. Some mild atrophy was reported in both groups (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.45 to 6.83; 5/35 versus 3/37). This evidence was rated as low certainty.Irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light: local combination ultraviolet light therapy (PUVA) may lead to improvement in investigator-rated symptom control when compared to local narrow-band UVB after 12 weeks of treatment (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.16; 1 study, 60 participants). However, the 95% CI indicates that PUVA might make little or no difference. Participant-rated symptoms were not measured. Adverse events (mainly erythema) were reported by 9/30 participants in the narrow-band UVB group versus none in the PUVA group. This evidence was rated as moderate certainty.Topical calcineurin inhibitors: tacrolimus 0.1% over two weeks probably improves investigator-rated symptom control measured after three weeks compared to vehicle (14/14 tacrolimus versus 0/14 vehicle; 1 study). Participant-rated symptoms were not measured. Four of 14 people in the tacrolimus group versus zero in the vehicle group had well-tolerated application site burning/itching.A within-participant study in 16 participants compared 0.1% tacrolimus to 0.1% mometasone furoate but did not measure investigator- or participant-rated symptoms. Both treatments were well tolerated when assessed at two weeks during four weeks of treatment.Evidence from these studies was rated as moderate certainty.Oral interventions: oral cyclosporin 3 mg/kg/d probably slightly improves investigator-rated (RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.99; 1 study, 34 participants) or participant-rated (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.27) control of symptoms compared to topical betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% after six weeks of treatment. The risk of adverse events such as dizziness was similar between groups (up to 36 weeks; RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.86, n = 55; 15/27 betamethasone versus 19/28 cyclosporin). The evidence was rated as moderate certainty.Alitretinoin 10 mg improves investigator-rated symptom control compared with placebo (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.07; NNTB 11, 95% CI 6.3 to 26.5; 2 studies, n = 781) and alitretinoin 30 mg also improves this outcome compared with placebo (RR 2.75, 95% CI 2.20 to 3.43; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5; 2 studies, n = 1210). Similar results were found for participant-rated symptom control: alitretinoin 10 mg RR 1.73 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.40) and 30 mg RR 2.75 (95% CI 2.18 to 3.48). Evidence was rated as high certainty. The number of adverse events (including headache) probably did not differ between alitretinoin 10 mg and placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.55; 1 study, n = 158; moderate-certainty evidence), but the risk of headache increased with alitretinoin 30 mg (RR 3.43, 95% CI 2.45 to 4.81; 2 studies, n = 1210; high-certainty evidence). Outcomes were assessed between 48 and 72 weeks. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Most findings were from single studies with low precision, so they should be interpreted with caution. Topical corticosteroids and UV phototherapy were two of the major standard treatments, but evidence is insufficient to support one specific treatment over another. The effect of topical calcineurin inhibitors is not certain. Alitretinoin is more effective than placebo in controlling symptoms, but advantages over other treatments need evaluating.Well-designed and well-reported, long-term (more than three months), head-to-head studies comparing different treatments are needed. Consensus is required regarding the definition of hand eczema and its subtypes, and a standard severity scale should be established.The main limitation was heterogeneity between studies. Small sample size impacted our ability to detect differences between treatments.",0

In vitro studies indicate that tissue plasminogen activator produced substantial lysis of clots at concentrations comparable to those expected in vivo, suggesting that this may be the mechanism of action of this drug. Drug-induced hemorrhages were not demonstrable. Tissue plasminogen activator may be of value for the immediate treatment of embolic stroke.",0
12021280,Orphan nuclear hormone receptor Rev-erbalpha regulates the human apolipoprotein CIII promoter,"Apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) plays an important role in plasma triglyceride and remnant lipoprotein metabolism. Because hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor in coronary artery disease and the presence in plasma of triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins is correlated with atherosclerosis, considerable research efforts have been focused on the identification of factors regulating apoCIII gene expression to decrease its production. Here we report that the orphan nuclear hormone receptor Rev-erbalpha regulates the human apoCIII gene promoter. In apoCIII expressing human hepatic HepG2 cells, transfection of Rev-erbalpha specifically repressed apoCIII gene promoter activity. We determined by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis experiments that Rev-erbalpha dependent repression is mainly due to an element present in the proximal promoter of the apoCIII gene. In contrast, we found no functional Rev-erbalpha response elements in the convergently transcribed human apoAI gene or the common regulatory enhancer. The identified Rev-erbalpha response element coincides with a RORalpha1 element, and in the present study we provide evidence that functional cross-talk between these orphan receptors modulates the apoCIII promoter. In vitro binding analysis showed that monomers of Rev-erbalpha bound this element but not another upstream RORalpha1 response element. In addition, we showed that the closely related nuclear orphan receptor RVR also specifically repressed the human apoCIII gene. These studies underscore a novel physiological role for members of the Rev-erb family of nuclear receptors in the regulation of genes involved in triglyceride metabolism and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",1
24169480,"Skin cancer in primary care: frequency, need to further education and subjective diagnostic certainty. A cross sectional survey among general practitioners in Canton of Zurich","BACKGROUND: Incidence of malignant skin lesions is rising in Switzerland. We wanted to assess the frequency of patients with suspicious skin lesions in daily practice. Furthermore, we asked for diagnostic certainty and the need of further education in skin cancer. METHODS: Survey with 1212 GPs in the canton of Zurich, descriptive analysis, regression analysis. RESULTS: Response rate 41,4%. 23,2% of the GPs saw daily/weekly patients with suspicious skin lesions, another 34,8% monthly. 79,0% reported need for further education in skin cancer. This need was lower in urban GPs and in GPs with higher diagnostic certainty. CONCLUSIONS: GPs saw relatively often patients with suspicious skin lesions. Despite high diagnostic certainty, there was a clear need for further education in skin cancer.",0

The present study was designed to investigate the alterations of coagulation and fibrinolysis in rabbits that received thoracic irradiation. Serial bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed after the irradiation, and procoagulant activity (PCA) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) were measured in BAL fluids. PCA increased from 2 to 8 weeks after irradiation with increased number of macrophages and increased PCA per macrophage. T-PA also increased with a significant difference at 4 weeks compared to controls. Although irradiation activated both PCA and t-PA, PCA increased prior to t-PA and the elevation lasted longer. It was concluded that activation of the coagulation system promotes pulmonary fibrin deposition and may contribute to the progression of pulmonary injury.",0
29183747,Anticonvulsant effect of the hydroethanolic leaf extract of Psydrax subcordata (DC.) Bridson in murine models,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Psydrax subcordata (DC.) Bridson is a tropical medicinal plant used traditionally for the management of epilepsy. However, there is little scientific evidence to support its use. AIM OF STUDY: The current study investigated the anticonvulsant properties of the hydroethanolic leaf extract of Psydrax subcordata (PSE) in animal models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anticonvulsant effects were evaluated in mouse models of acute seizures (pentylenetetrazole-, picrotoxin-, 4-aminopyridine-, strychnine- and maximal electroshock-induced seizure tests) and status epilepticus (Lithium/pilocarpine-induced SE). The role of GABAergic mechanisms in the actions of the extract was also examined by pre-treatment of animals with flumazenil in the pentylenetetrazole test. RESULTS: The extract (30, 100 and 300mg/kg, p.o.) significantly delayed the onset and decreased the duration and frequency of pentylenetetrazole- and picrotoxin-convulsions. PSE also reduced the duration of tonic hind limb extensions in the maximal electroshock-induced seizure test. Furthermore, PSE pre-treatment significantly delayed the onset of seizures and improved survival in the 4-aminopyridine-induced seizure test. In the strychnine-induced seizure test, PSE treatment did not significantly affect the latency to convulsions and time until death when compared to controls. PSE exhibited anticonvulsant effects in the lithium/pilocarpine test by delaying the onset of seizures and status epilepticus as well as reducing the severity of seizures and mortality of mice. Again, the anticonvulsant effect of PSE (100mg/kg, p.o.) was blocked by pre-treatment with flumazenil in the PTZ test. CONCLUSION: PSE has anticonvulsant activity in animal models, and this effect may be mediated, at least partly, through GABAergic mechanisms.",0
10520991,CCR7 coordinates the primary immune response by establishing functional microenvironments in secondary lymphoid organs,"The proper function of immune surveillance requires well-coordinated mechanisms in order to guide the patrolling immune cells through peripheral tissues and into secondary lymphoid organs. Analyzing gene-targeted mice, we identified the chemokine receptor CCR7 as an important organizer of the primary immune response. CCR7-deficient mice show severely delayed kinetics regarding the antibody response and lack contact sensitivity and delayed type hypersensitivity reactions. Due to the impaired migration of lymphocytes, these animals reveal profound morphological alterations in all secondary lymphoid organs. Upon activation, mature skin dendritic cells fail to migrate into the draining lymph nodes. Thus, in order to bring together lymphocytes and dendritic cells to form the characteristic microarchitecture of secondary lymphoid organs, CCR7 is required to rapidly initiate an adoptive immune response.",1
3827873,Human monoclonal antibody recognizing liver-type aldolase B,"A human hybridoma clone (4E3) has been established by fusing lymphocytes from a lymph node taken from a breast cancer patient and human lymphoblastoid cells, LICR-LON-HMy2, by the poly(ethylene glycol) method. 4E3 has been stabilized and continued to secrete IgMk antibody into culture medium (greater than 10 micrograms/ml) for over 1 year. The following characteristics of the antigen strongly suggested that 4E3 recognizes liver-type aldolase B (EC 4.1.2.13): the Mr of the native molecule is 160,000 and that of the subunit is 40,000, and thus it has a tetrameric structure of identical subunits; the antigen is abundant in the liver and kidney of human, mouse and rabbit, and is localized by immunohistochemical methods in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and in the proximal tubules of the kidney; the antigen is precipitable by 50-80% saturation with (NH4)2SO4; the antigen shows charge-dependent heterogeneity on DEAE-cellulose chromatography. To confirm this notion, aldolase B was purified to homogeneity from the liver of human, mouse and rabbit by phosphocellulose chromatography. During the chromatographic purification, the antigen activity as assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (e.l.i.s.a.) was superimposed on the enzymic activity of aldolase. Furthermore, monoclonal antibody 4E3 strongly reacted with purified aldolase B in SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting and also in e.l.i.s.a. using microplates coated with purified enzyme. The reaction between aldolase B and 4E3 activated the human complement system as assessed by the attachment of C3 to the immune complex of aldolase B and 4E3.",1
25933159,A novel micelle-forming material used for preparing a theranostic vehicle exhibiting enhanced in vivo therapeutic efficacy,"A new micelle-forming material, folic acid-conjugated carboxymethyl lauryl chitosan (FA-CLC), and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles were used for preparing an imaging-guided drug vehicle (the FA-CLC/SPIO hybrid micelle) that demonstrates targeted delivery, imaging, and controlled release of hydrophobic agents. We found that the ratio of viable normal cells to tumor cells was increased prominently after delivery of camptothecin (CPT)-loaded FA-CLC/SPIO micelles and therapeutic sonication. In addition, a magnetic field could enhance the tumor-targeting effect of FA-CLC/SPIO micelles. Therefore, after sequential administration of magnetic attraction to CPT-loaded FA-CLC/SPIO micelles, and therapeutic sonication, the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of CPT was markedly enhanced. However, a nonfocused magnetic field could enhance the undesirable accumulation of iron-containing vehicles in the liver if the tumor (i.e., magnetic attraction site) is near the liver. We propose that magnetic attraction must be carefully applied, far from the liver. ",0

22291008,"Cloning and characterization of CD300d, a novel member of the human CD300 family of immune receptors","Herein we present the cloning and molecular characterization of CD300d, a member of the human CD300 family of immune receptors. CD300d cDNA was cloned from RNA obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and RT-PCR revealed the gene to be expressed in cells of myeloid lineage. The cloned cDNA encoded for a type I protein with a single extracellular Ig V-type domain and a predicted molecular mass of 21.5 kDa. The short cytoplasmic tail is lacking in any known signaling motif, but there is a negatively charged residue (glutamic acid) within the transmembrane domain. CD300d forms complexes with the CD300 family members, with the exception of CD300c. Contrary to other activating members of the CD300 family of receptors, surface expression of CD300d in COS-7-transfected cells required the presence of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif-bearing adaptor (FcepsilonRgamma). Accordingly, we found that CD300d was able to recruit FcepsilonRgamma. Unexpectedly, we could not detect CD300d on the surface of cells expressing FcepsilonRgamma, suggesting the existence of unknown mechanisms regulating the trafficking of this molecule. The presence of other CD300 molecules also did not modify the intracellular expression of CD300d. In fact, the presence of CD300d decreased the levels of surface expression of CD300f but not CD300c. Our data suggest that the function of CD300d would be related to the regulation of the expression of other CD300 molecules and the composition of CD300 complexes on the cell surface.",1
21879052,"Spectral and intramolecular charge transfer properties in terminal donor/acceptor-substituted all-trans-alpha,omega-diphenylpolyenes and alpha,omega-diphenylpolyynes","The absorption spectra and intramolecular charge transfer (CT) properties of terminal donor/acceptor-substituted all-trans-alpha,omega-diphenylpolyenes (DPE) and alpha,omega-diphenylpolyynes (DPY) molecules with different conjugated bridge length and substitution modes were investigated by using quantum chemical calculations. We calculated the ground state structures and energy of two series of terminal donor/acceptor DPE and DPY by DFT method. The dependence of conjugation length and substitution modes of the electronic absorption spectra was obtained by TDDFT calculation. The hybrid-GGA XC-functional PBE0 employed in this work was selected from several functionals by comparing the calculated electronic spectral data with experimental value. The CIS-based generalized Mulliken-Hush (GMH) approach was further used to calculate coupling values H(AD) of the CT process. The calculation shows that both the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps and average bond length alternations between unsaturated multiple (C identical withC and C=C) and saturated single bonds (C-C) decrease regularly with the extension of conjugation. The effective conjugated length (ECL) of DPE and DPY with the same order MM > MP/PM > PP is found together with the regular red shift of the electronic absorption spectra with the extension of conjugation, resulting from the different pi-electron delocalization and conjugation efficiency. The GMH analysis further suggests that the CT process in both DPE and DPY is predominated by the through-bond mechanism. The remarkable difference of the conjugated length dependence of squared CT coupling between substituted DPE and DPY is the result of the energetic matching degree of the frontier molecular orbitals between donor/acceptor and the conjugated bridge.",0
11387004,Long-term results of metallic stents for benign biliary strictures,"BACKGROUND: Historically, surgical correction has been the treatment of choice for benign biliary strictures (BBS). Self-expandable metallic stents (MSs) have been useful for inoperable malignant biliary strictures; however, their use for BBS is controversial and their natural history unknown. HYPOTHESIS: To test our hypothesis that MSs provide only short-term benefit, we examined the long-term outcome of MSs for the treatment of BBS. Our goal was to develop a rational approach for treating BBS. DATA EXTRACTION: Between July 1990 and December 1995, 15 patients had MSs placed for BBS and have been followed up for a mean of 86.3 months (range, 55-120 months). The mean age of the patients was 66.6 years and 12 were women. Stents were placed for surgical injury in 5 patients and underlying disease in 10 patients (lithiasis, 7; pancreatitis, 2; and primary sclerosing cholangitis, 1). One or more MSs (Gianturco-Rosch ",0

This work was designed to clarify details in repair pathways acting to remove DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by TMZ. Cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts were used which were deficient in DSB repair genes such as homologous recombination repair-related genes X-ray repair cross-complementing group 2 (XRCC2)and radiation sensitive mutant54 (Rad54), non-homologous end joining repair-related gene DNAligase IV (Lig4). Cell sensitivity to drug treatments was assessed using colony forming assays. The most effective molecular target which was correlated with TMZ cell sensitivity was Lig4. In addition, it was found that small interference RNAs (siRNA) for Lig4 efficiently enhanced cell lethality induced by TMZ in human glioblastoma A172 cells. These findings suggest that down regulation of Lig4 might provide a useful tool for cell sensitization during TMZ chemotherapy.",0
25622348,Hexadecane-induced hyperkeratinization of guinea pig skin. III. Cutaneous penetration of topically applied hexadecane-1-C-14,"The C-14 content of epidermis, dermis, subdermal muscle and certain other tissues was determined 48 hours following topical application of hexadecane-1-C-14 to the skin of guinea pigs. The effect of simultaneous application of U.S.P. heavy mineral oil, n-docosane, and heptane as well as hexadecane pre-treatment on the extent of penetration of hexadecane-1-C-14 was also measured. Large amounts of C-14 were found in the epidermis whereas relatively little accumulated in the dermis and underlying tissues. Each of the carrier vehicles reduced the amount of C-14 in the epidermis; whereas, docosane and mineral oil, but not heptane, reduced the amount of C-14 in the dermis and subdermal muscle. This correlated with the ability of heavy mineral oil and docosane, but not heptane, to decrease the dermatoxic effects of hexadecane. Pre-treatment of the skin with hexadecane 48 hours prior to application of hexadecane-1-C-14, if anything, increased the amount of the C-14 in the epidermis; however, pre-treatment with mineral oil:hexadecane reduced the amount of epidermal and dermal C-14 from a subsequent application of mineral oil:hexadecane-1-C-14. The results support the proposal that heavy mineral oil and alkanes with a chain length of over 20 carbon atoms reduce the dermatoxic effect of hexadecane by interfering with its penetration to the site of action. This site would appear to be either the deeper layers of epidermis or possibly the dermis. The increased uptake of hexadecane-C-14 by the epidermis following pretreatment with hexadecane provides a possible explanation for the more severe response seen with multiple hexadecane applications as opposed to a single application of the same amount of material.",0
31126307,Prognostic significance of lung radiation dose in patients with esophageal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy,"BACKGROUND: The prognostic significance of radiation dose to the lung or heart is unknown in esophageal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (trimodal therapy). This study aimed to determine the association between lung and heart radiation dose volumes and prognosis of esophageal cancer after trimodal therapy. METHODS: This study reviewed 123 esophageal cancer patients treated with trimodal therapy in two tertiary institutions between 2010 and 2015. The dose-volume histogram parameter of Vx was defined as the percentage of total organ volume receiving a radiation dose of x (Gy) or more. Predictors of overall survival (OS) were identified using Cox regression models. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were used to select cut-off values for dose-volume. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 28.3 months (range: 4.7-92.8 months). Median OS and progression-free survival were 34.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27.4-40.6 months) and 24.8 months (95% CI, 18.9-30.7 months), respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that lung V20 (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI: 1.04-1.14; p < 0.001) and lung V5 (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI: 1.00-1.05; p = 0.03) were associated with OS when adjusting for surgical margin and pathological treatment response. The 5-year OS for patients with lung V20 </= 23% vs. patients with lung V20 > 23% was 54.4% vs. 5% (p < 0.001) whereas that for patients with lung V5 </= 56% vs. patients with lung V5 > 56% was 81.5% vs. 23.4% (p < 0.001). Mean heart dose showed no association with survival outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Lung radiation dose was independently associated with survival outcomes in esophageal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery.",0
9253359,Two novel missense mutations in calcium-sensing receptor gene associated with neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism,"Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is characterized by lifelong asymptomatic hypercalcemia without PTH hypersecretion and is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with near 100% penetrance. In contrast, neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by marked hypercalcemia and PTH hypersecretion. FHH/NSHPT results from inactivating mutations of the human calcium-sensing receptor (Casr) gene on chromosome 3q13.3-24. Nearly 30 different mutations of the Casr gene associated with FHH/NSHPT have been reported previously. In this report, genetic analysis of 1 Japanese NSHPT family revealed 2 novel mutations at codon 185 (CGA-->TGA/Arg-->Ter) in exon 4 of the Casr gene and at codon 670 (GGG-->GAG/Gly-->Glu) in exon 7. The Arg185Ter change was shown to occur in the proband's unaffected father and paternal grandmother as well as in the proband. The other mutation in exon 7 was shown in the proband's unaffected mother of Philippine origin as well as in the proband. This family is the first case of manifestation of more than 1 mutation in a proband's chromosomes; 1 mutation was obtained from the unaffected father, and the other was from the unaffected mother. Our observations have given us important keys to help elucidate the structure-function relationships of the Casr.",1
29574663,Assessment of Protein Prenylation Pathway in Multiple Sclerosis Patients,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder with several genetic and environmental factors being implicated in its pathogenesis. Protein prenylation as one of the important posttranslational modifications of proteins has crucial role in immune system regulation. In the current case-control study, we compared expression of five genes coding for the different subunits of proteins implicated in protein prenylation in 50 Iranian MS patients with those of healthy subjects. No significant difference has been found in FNTA and PGGT1B expressions between cases and controls. Spearman correlation analysis between FNTA relative expression and disease duration showed significant correlation in male patients (r = - 0.671, P = 0.024) but not female patients (r = 0.253, P = 0.12). FNTB expression was significantly higher in MS patients compared with healthy subjects. Spearman correlation analysis between FNTB relative expression and disease duration showed significant correlation in male patients (r = -0.876, P = 0.004) but not female patients (r = 0.296, P = 0.06). RABGGTA was significantly upregulated in total MS patients, total male patients, female patients aged between 30 and 40 and male patients aged >40 compared with corresponding control groups. RABGGTB was significantly downregulated in total MS patients, total female patients, and female patients aged > 40 compared with corresponding control groups. Totally, we demonstrated dysregulation of protein prenylation pathway in MS patients compared with healthy subjects. Future studies are needed to find the clinical implication of this pathway in MS patients.",0
11206884,"Symptomatic, endoscopic and histological assessment of upper gastrointestinal tract in renal transplant recipients","AIM: To assess the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, endoscopic findings, and histological abnormalities in renal transplant recipients. SETTING: Teaching hospital in northern Jordan. METHODS: Seventy-six renal transplant recipients with stable renal function were interviewed for gastrointestinal symptoms, and underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy; gastric antral biopsies were evaluated for inflammatory changes and the presence of Helicobacter pylori. One hundred consecutive patients attending the general medical outpatient for various medical problems served as controls; 41 of them consented to undergo endoscopy and biopsy examination. RESULTS: Upper gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 50% of patients compared to 47% of controls (p=0.80). Endoscopic abnormalities were found in 71% versus 63.4%. One patient in each group had duodenal ulcer. H. pylori were found in 60.5% versus 46.3% (p=0.20), and histological gastritis in 40 (52.6%) with acute inflammatory changes in 22 (28.9%), compared to 21 (51.2%) and 15 (36.6%) controls, respectively. Monilial and cytomegalovirus esophagitis were found in 2 (2.6%) and one patient, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and endoscopic and histological findings in stable renal transplant recipients are similar to those in controls. Also, there was no increase in opportunistic infections of the gastrointestinal tract or of gastric H. pylori in these patients.",0
19812356,"Ca2+ cycling in cardiomyocytes from a high-performance reptile, the varanid lizard (Varanus exanthematicus)","The varanid lizard possesses one of the largest aerobic capacities among reptiles with maximum rates of oxygen consumption that are twice that of other lizards of comparable sizes at the same temperature. To support this aerobic capacity, the varanid heart possesses morphological adaptations that allow the generation of high heart rates and blood pressures. Specializations in excitation-contraction coupling may also contribute to the varanids superior cardiovascular performance. Therefore, we investigated the electrophysiological properties of the l-type Ca(2+) channel and the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) and the contribution of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to the intracellular Ca(2+) transient (Delta[Ca(2+)](i)) in varanid lizard ventricular myocytes. Additionally, we used confocal microscopy to visualize myocytes and make morphological measurements. Lizard ventricular myocytes were found to be spindle-shaped, lack T-tubules, and were approximately 190 microm in length and 5-7 microm in width and depth. Cardiomyocytes had a small cell volume ( approximately 2 pL), leading to a large surface area-to-volume ratio (18.5), typical of ectothermic vertebrates. The voltage sensitivity of the l-type Ca(2+) channel current (I(Ca)), steady-state activation and inactivation curves, and the time taken for recovery from inactivation were also similar to those measured in other reptiles and teleosts. However, transsarcolemmal Ca(2+) influx via reverse mode Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange current was fourfold higher than most other ectotherms. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum led to a 40% reduction in the Delta[Ca(2+)](i) amplitude, and slowed the time course of decay. In aggregate, our results suggest varanids have an enhanced capacity to transport Ca(2+) through the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, and sarcoplasmic reticulum suggesting specializations in excitation-contraction coupling may provide a means to support high cardiovascular performance.",0

24117009,Aminoacylase I deficiency due to ACY1 mRNA exon skipping,"Aminoacylase 1 (ACY1) deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism of which less than 20 observations have been described. Patients exhibit urinary excretion of specific N-acetyl amino acids and manifest a heterogeneous clinical spectrum including intellectual disability, motor delay, seizures, moderate to severe mental retardation, absent speech, growth delay, muscular hypotonia and autistic features. Here, we report the case of ACY1 enzyme deficiency in a 6-year-old girl presenting severe intellectual disability, motor retardation, absence of spontaneous locomotor activity and severe speech delay. Urinary excretion of N-acetylated amino acids was present. Mutational analysis of ACY1 gene identified the new homozygous c.1001_1001+5del6 mutation, which alters the mRNA transcription leading to exon 13 skipping and inclusion of a premature stop codon (p.Lys308Glufs*7). A quantitative fluorescent multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (QFM-PCR) assay has been set up and confirmed homozygosity of the mutation in the patient's DNA. Biochemical analysis showed absence of ACY1 enzyme activity in the patient's fibroblasts. The structure of the mutated protein has been defined by homology modeling (HM). Our data endorse the hypothesis of a link between this inborn error of metabolism and the neurological manifestations observed in patients with ACY1 deficiency. ",1
20011598,The danger signal adenosine induces persistence of chlamydial infection through stimulation of A2b receptors,"Infections with intracellular bacteria such as chlamydiae affect the majority of the world population. Infected tissue inflammation and granuloma formation help contain the short-term expansion of the invading pathogen, leading also to local tissue damage and hypoxia. However, the effects of key aspects of damaged inflamed tissues and hypoxia on continued infection with intracellular bacteria remain unknown. We find that development of Chlamydia trachomatis is reversibly retarded by prolonged exposure of infected cells to extracellular adenosine, a hallmark of hypoxia and advanced inflammation. In epithelial cells, this effect was mediated by the A2b adenosine receptor, unique in the adenosine receptor family for having a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1-alpha) binding site at its promoter region, and was dependent on an increase in the intracellular cAMP levels, but was independent of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Further study of adenosine receptor signaling during intracellular bacterial infection could lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of persistent infections with these ubiquitous pathogens.",0
8689683,Atm-deficient mice: a paradigm of ataxia telangiectasia,"A murine model of ataxia telangiectasia was created by disrupting the Atm locus via gene targeting. Mice homozygous for the disrupted Atm allele displayed growth retardation, neurologic dysfunction, male and female infertility secondary to the absence of mature gametes, defects in T lymphocyte maturation, and extreme sensitivity to gamma-irradiation. The majority of animals developed malignant thymic lymphomas between 2 and 4 months of age. Several chromosomal anomalies were detected in one of these tumors. Fibroblasts from these mice grew slowly and exhibited abnormal radiation-induced G1 checkpoint function. Atm-disrupted mice recapitulate the ataxia telangiectasia phenotype in humans, providing a mammalian model in which to study the pathophysiology of this pleiotropic disorder.",1

11536076,Germline mutations in BMPR1A/ALK3 cause a subset of cases of juvenile polyposis syndrome and of Cowden and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes,"Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is an inherited hamartomatous-polyposis syndrome with a risk for colon cancer. JPS is a clinical diagnosis by exclusion, and, before susceptibility genes were identified, JPS could easily be confused with other inherited hamartoma syndromes, such as Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS) and Cowden syndrome (CS). Germline mutations of MADH4 (SMAD4) have been described in a variable number of probands with JPS. A series of familial and isolated European probands without MADH4 mutations were analyzed for germline mutations in BMPR1A, a member of the transforming growth-factor beta-receptor superfamily, upstream from the SMAD pathway. Overall, 10 (38%) probands were found to have germline BMPR1A mutations, 8 of which resulted in truncated receptors and 2 of which resulted in missense alterations (C124R and C376Y). Almost all available component tumors from mutation-positive cases showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the BMPR1A region, whereas those from mutation-negative cases did not. One proband with CS/CS-like phenotype was also found to have a germline BMPR1A missense mutation (A338D). Thus, germline BMPR1A mutations cause a significant proportion of cases of JPS and might define a small subset of cases of CS/BRRS with specific colonic phenotype.",1
11998581,Working with patients: developing a service user group in one A&E department,"Recognition, by personnel in one emergency department, that the modern emergency service has to be responsive and sensitive to the needs of patients in the local community, led to a project aimed at setting up a service user council. The purpose of the council was to provide opportunities for both staff and service users to play an active part in service development and evaluation. It was anticipated that such an initiative would 1) promote the development of a patient-centred service; 2) recognize the value of multidisciplinary work in relation to patient care and 3) identify areas of priority for service development. In addition to this, it was anticipated that issues associated with patients' expectations of the service, as well as the ways in which the service was accessed could also be addressed.",0
1362387,Alcohol dehydrogenase genes: restriction fragment length polymorphisms for ADH4 (pi-ADH) and ADH5 (chi-ADH) and construction of haplotypes among different ADH classes,"Of the five human alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) genes located in the region q21-25 of chromosome 4, genetic markers have been reported previously only for class I enzymes, ADH1-3. Here, new restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) are described for the genes of two other classes, ADH4 (pi) and ADH5 (chi or formaldehyde dehydrogenase, FDH). The frequencies and modes of inheritance of these RFLPs were determined with DNA both from unrelated individuals and from families. A polymorphic PstI site is assigned to the fourth intron of the ADH4 gene. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium calculations for these new RFLPs and already known RFLPs at the ADH2 and ADH3 loci establish strong linkage disequilibria between polymorphic MspI and BstXI sites in the ADH5 gene as well as between XbaI and MspI sites in the ADH3 gene. Furthermore, linkage disequilibria were detected between RFLPs of the ADH2 and ADH3 genes as well as between those of the ADH4 and ADH5 genes. The latter disequilibrium implies a hitherto unknown physical proximity of two genes belonging to different ADH classes. The RFLPs were used to construct chromosomal haplotypes that include three ADH classes. Of the 16 possible haplotypes for four RFLP markers used here, 10 were experimentally detected. The potential application of the ADH RFLPs and haplotypes in linkage or association studies of inherited diseases such as familial ",1
18334579,Calpain 3 is a modulator of the dysferlin protein complex in skeletal muscle,"Muscular dystrophies comprise a genetically heterogeneous group of degenerative muscle disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Two forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, 2A and 2B, are caused by mutations in calpain 3 (CAPN3) and dysferlin (DYSF), respectively. While CAPN3 may be involved in sarcomere remodeling, DYSF is proposed to play a role in membrane repair. The coexistence of CAPN3 and AHNAK, a protein involved in subsarcolemmal cytoarchitecture and membrane repair, in the dysferlin protein complex and the presence of proteolytic cleavage fragments of AHNAK in skeletal muscle led us to investigate whether AHNAK can act as substrate for CAPN3. We here demonstrate that AHNAK is cleaved by CAPN3 and show that AHNAK is lost in cells expressing active CAPN3. Conversely, AHNAK accumulates when calpain 3 is defective in skeletal muscle of calpainopathy patients. Moreover, we demonstrate that AHNAK fragments cleaved by CAPN3 have lost their affinity for dysferlin. Thus, our findings suggest interconnectivity between both diseases by revealing a novel physiological role for CAPN3 in regulating the dysferlin protein complex.",1
21886157,Human metabolic individuality in biomedical and pharmaceutical research,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many risk loci for complex diseases, but effect sizes are typically small and information on the underlying biological processes is often lacking. Associations with metabolic traits as functional intermediates can overcome these problems and potentially inform individualized therapy. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of genotype-dependent metabolic phenotypes using a GWAS with non-targeted metabolomics. We identified 37 genetic loci associated with blood metabolite concentrations, of which 25 show effect sizes that are unusually high for GWAS and account for 10-60% differences in metabolite levels per allele copy. Our associations provide new functional insights for many disease-related associations that have been reported in previous studies, including those for cardiovascular and kidney disorders, type 2 diabetes, cancer, gout, venous thromboembolism and Crohn's disease. The study advances our knowledge of the genetic basis of metabolic individuality in humans and generates many new hypotheses for biomedical and pharmaceutical research.",1
19412162,F-box protein FBXO31 mediates cyclin D1 degradation to induce G1 arrest after DNA damage,"In response to DNA damage, eukaryotic cells initiate a complex signalling pathway, termed the DNA damage response (DDR), which coordinates cell cycle arrest with DNA repair. Studies have shown that oncogene-induced senescence, which provides a barrier to tumour development, involves activation of the DDR. Using a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen, we have identified 17 factors required for oncogenic BRAF to induce senescence in primary fibroblasts and melanocytes. One of these factors is an F-box protein, FBXO31, a candidate tumour suppressor encoded in 16q24.3, a region in which there is loss of heterozygosity in breast, ovarian, hepatocellular and prostate cancers. Here we study the cellular role of FBXO31, identify its target substrate and determine the basis for its growth inhibitory activity. We show that ectopic expression of FBXO31 acts through a proteasome-directed pathway to mediate the degradation of cyclin D1, an important regulator of progression from G1 to S phase, resulting in arrest in G1. Cyclin D1 degradation results from a direct interaction with FBXO31 and is dependent on the F-box motif of FBXO31 and phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr 286, which is known to be required for cyclin D1 proteolysis. The involvement of the DDR in oncogene-induced senescence prompted us to investigate the role of FBXO31 in DNA repair. We find that DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation results in increased FBXO31 levels, which requires phosphorylation of FBXO31 by the DDR-initiating kinase ATM. RNAi-mediated knockdown of FBXO31 prevents cells from undergoing efficient arrest in G1 after gamma-irradiation and markedly increases sensitivity to DNA damage. Finally, we show that a variety of DNA damaging agents all result in a large increase in FBXO31 levels, indicating that induction of FBXO31 is a general response to genotoxic stress. Our results reveal FBXO31 as a regulator of the G1/S transition that is specifically required for DNA damage-induced growth arrest.",1
22057440,Motor and bladder dysfunctions in patients with vertebral fractures at the thoracolumbar junction,"OBJECTIVE: To present the motor deficits and type of neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NBD) in patients with vertebral fractures at thoracolumbar junction. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with single level vertebra fracture over T11-L2 with onset duration of longer than 3 years were enrolled. All participants provided basic demographic data, ambulatory status and received neurologic examination and urodynamic studies. The differences in distribution of NBD types, neurologic injury sites and functional walkers in patients with different levels of vertebral injury were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to define the cutoff value of lower extremities motor score (LEMS) in functional walker and non-walker. RESULTS: Of the 52 patients, the injured levels were 3 (5.8%) in T11, 21 (40.4%) in T12, 22 (42.3%) in L1, and 6 (11.5%) in L2 vertebrae. Eight (15.4%) patients had upper lumbar cord lesions, 26 (50.0%) had epiconus and lumbar roots lesions, 18 (34.6%) had conus medullaris or/and cauda equina lesions. Mean LEMS was 0 +/- 0, 5.4 +/- 7.7, 11.1 +/- 10.2, and 28.0 +/- 11.0 for patients with T11, T12, L1, and L2 fractures, respectively. Patients with L2 fractures had higher LEMS than other levels (p < 0.001). The cutoff value of LEMS for functional walking was set at 20, and both the sensitivity and specificity was 100%. Thirty-one (59.6%) patients had spastic NBD, 18 (35.6%) had flaccid NBD, and 3 (5.8%) had mixed type NBD. Positive prediction value of ankle spasticity for bladder and sphincter spasticity was 95.2 and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Half of the patients had epiconus lesion following thoracolumbar junction fracture, and they had a clinical presentation of flaccid legs and spastic NBD. Patients with L2 fracture had higher LEMS than patients with T11, T12, and L1 fracture. Patients whose LEMS was higher than 20 could all walk functionally. Fracture at the thoracolumbar junction may cause spastic, flaccid, or mixed type NBD, and urodynamic study is an essential tool for the correct diagnosis and management. Ankle spasticity has a high positive predictive value for spastic bladder or sphincter.",0
1310590,Evidence for a role of rap1 protein in the regulation of human platelet Ca2+ fluxes,"The relationship between the 22-24 kDa cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent phosphoprotein previously described as being involved in the regulation of human platelet membrane Ca2+ transport and a GTP-binding protein of low molecular mass (ras-like protein) was investigated. After isolation of plasma membranes and intracellular membranes, it was found that guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]) bound to plasma membrane proteins ranging in molecular mass from 22 to 29 kDa, but not to intracellular membranes. The major GTP-binding protein appeared as a 24 kDa protein under reduced conditions and a 22 kDa protein under non-reduced conditions. A similar membrane location and electrophoretic mobility were found for both the cAMP phosphoprotein and the protein recognized by a specific anti-rap1 antibody. The identity between the cAMP phosphoprotein and the rap1 GTP-binding protein was further examined by studying the functional effect of GTP on plasma membrane Ca2+ transport. A maximal GTP[S] concentration of 40 microM was found to: (1) inhibit to the same degree (40%) both Ca(2+)-ATPase activity and the Ca2+ transport function mediated by the Ca(2+)-ATPase; (2) inhibit the phosphorylation of the 22-24 kDa protein by the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (C.Sub.); and (3) abolish the stimulation of Ca2+ uptake induced by C.Sub. It is concluded that the platelet cAMP phosphoprotein is indeed the rap1 GTP-binding protein, and that it regulates plasma membrane Ca2+ transport, thus providing evidence for a new role of a ras-related protein.",0

Emerging evidence suggests that inguinal hernias in Ghana are approximately ten times as prevalent as in high-income countries, are much more long-standing and severe, and can be repaired with low-cost techniques using mosquito net mesh through international collaboration. Outcomes from surgery are comparable to published literature, and potential exists for scaling up capacity.

9931340,"The beta3A subunit gene (Ap3b1) of the AP-3 adaptor complex is altered in the mouse hypopigmentation mutant pearl, a model for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and night blindness","Lysosomes, melanosomes and platelet-dense granules are abnormal in the mouse hypopigmentation mutant pearl. The beta3A subunit of the AP-3 adaptor complex, which likely regulates protein trafficking in the trans - Golgi network/endosomal compartments, was identified as a candidate for the pearl gene by a positional/candidate cloning approach. Mutations, including a large internal tandem duplication and a deletion, were identified in two respective pearl alleles and are predicted to abrogate function of the beta3A protein. Significantly lowered expression of altered beta3A transcripts occurred in kidney of both mutant alleles. The several distinct pearl phenotypes suggest novel functions for the AP-3 complex in mammals. These experiments also suggest mutations in AP-3 subunits as a basis for unique forms of human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and congenital night blindness, for which the pearl mouse is an appropriate animal model.",1
32207956,Formation of Wrinkle Structures on Styrene-b-isoprene-b-styrene Films Using One-Step Ion-Beam Irradiation,"We investigated the wrinkle formation on ion-beam (IB)-irradiated substrates coated with the thermoplastic elastomer styrene-b-isoprene-b-styrene (SIS) and demonstrate a relation of the wrinkle structure and the newly formed top layer induced by IB. IB irradiation led to polymer cross-linking on the surface, thereby forming a new skin layer, a finding which was supported by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, Young moduli calculated using force-distance curves, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profiling. The wrinkle wavelength increased according to the irradiation time, which indicates that the latter mainly increased the thickness of the cross-linking layer. The increase in the wrinkle wavelength varied from 420 to 670 nm by changing the IB irradiation time. In this paper, we present not only the expectation of wrinkle fabrication using our method but also the possibility of choosing diverse materials such as the thermoplastic elastomer SIS for fabrication of wrinkle structures.",0
11349232,"Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) mutations identified by MS/MS-based prospective screening of newborns differ from those observed in patients with clinical symptoms: identification and characterization of a new, prevalent mutation that results in mild MCAD deficiency","Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is the most frequently diagnosed mitochondrial beta-oxidation defect, and it is potentially fatal. Eighty percent of patients are homozygous for a common mutation, 985A-->G, and a further 18% have this mutation in only one disease allele. In addition, a large number of rare disease-causing mutations have been identified and characterized. There is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation. High 985A-->G carrier frequencies in populations of European descent and the usual avoidance of recurrent disease episodes by patients diagnosed with MCAD deficiency who comply with a simple dietary treatment suggest that MCAD deficiency is a candidate in prospective screening of newborns. Therefore, several such screening programs employing analysis of acylcarnitines in blood spots by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) are currently used worldwide. No validation of this method by mutation analysis has yet been reported. We investigated for MCAD mutations in newborns from US populations who had been identified by prospective MS/MS-based screening of 930,078 blood spots. An MCAD-deficiency frequency of 1/15,001 was observed. Our mutation analysis shows that the MS/MS-based method is excellent for detection of MCAD deficiency but that the frequency of the 985A-->G mutant allele in newborns with a positive acylcarnitine profile is much lower than that observed in clinically affected patients. Our identification of a new mutation, 199T-->C, which has never been observed in patients with clinically manifested disease but was present in a large proportion of the acylcarnitine-positive samples, may explain this skewed ratio. Overexpression experiments showed that this is a mild folding mutation that exhibits decreased levels of enzyme activity only under stringent conditions. A carrier frequency of 1/500 in the general population makes the 199T-->C mutation one of the three most prevalent mutations in the enzymes of fatty-acid oxidation.",1
30919473,Correlation between Hypervascularization of the First Annular Pulley on Color Doppler Imaging of Trigger Finger and Patients' Backgrounds,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between hypervascularization of the first annular (A1) pulley on color Doppler imaging of trigger finger and patients' backgrounds. METHODS: A total of 148 trigger digits from 144 patients were studied with ultrasound at the time of initial diagnosis. We observed the A1 pulley at the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint in a transverse image and noted the presence or absence of a signal in the A1 pulley on color Doppler imaging. Patients' ages, sexes, clinical grades, symptom durations, prevalence of interphalangeal joint contracture, and visual analog scale pain scores were compared between the groups with positive and negative Doppler findings. RESULTS: The 144 patients included 45 men and 99 women. Sixty-one of 148 digits (41%) showed positive Doppler findings in the A1 pulley. Patients' ages and visual analog scale scores in the Doppler-positive group were slightly greater than those in the Doppler-negative group (P = .03; P < .01, respectively). The digit with positive Doppler findings tended to be categorized into a severer grade and into the group with a shorter symptom duration (P < .01 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Hypervascularization of the A1 pulley tended to appear in an earlier period after the patients had become aware of symptoms, as frequently as their symptoms became severe, in conjunction with higher pain scores. Doppler imaging of the A1 pulley might help in better understanding patients' conditions.",0
6202501,Control of androgen cytosol receptor concentrations in Sertoli cells: effect of androgens,"Androgen receptor concentrations were measured in Sertoli cells under a variety of conditions. After brief (30- to 60-min) incubation of cultured cells with [3H]R1881 (methyltrienolone), cytosol receptor concentrations were greatly diminished, and nuclear bound steroid was elevated. Removal of the exogenous steroid was accompanied by a return of cytosol receptor to preincubation concentrations by 1 h and a slower decline in nuclear bound steroid. In the continued presence of R1881 or testosterone, cytoplasmic receptor concentrations declined and then returned to or above preincubation concentrations by 6-17 h. Actinomycin-D and cycloheximide did not alter this pattern. Over this same interval, nuclear bound steroid concentrations remained elevated. Exposure of the cells to R1881 or testosterone for the entire 72-h culture period did not alter cytoplasmic receptor concentrations. Cytoplasmic androgen receptor concentrations were decreased in Sertoli cells from hypophysectomized rats 15-22 days after surgery compared to those in cells from intact controls. Treatment with testosterone propionate (0.5 mg/day) or FSH (75 micrograms/day) prevented the decline in receptor concentrations. Cryptorchidy (33 days) also decreased cytosol receptor concentrations. These data indicate that exposure to androgens can influence Sertoli cell cytosol androgen receptor concentrations in vitro and in vivo. The Sertoli cell adapts to the continual presence of androgens with a return of cytosol receptor while maintaining elevated concentrations of nuclear bound steroid. In vivo, androgen treatment can maintain cytoplasmic receptor concentrations in the absence of pituitary hormones in the immature rat.",0

2294404,The DNA-binding activity of transcription factor PTF1 parallels the synthesis of pancreas-specific mRNAs during mouse development,"We have studied the expression of the alpha-amylase, trypsin, and elastase II genes in the acinar pancreas during mouse development. Transcriptional control is the major mechanism by which the differential accumulation of alpha-amylase, trypsin, and elastase II mRNAs is determined during late embryogenesis. The synthesis of pancreatic mRNAs is detected around day 15 of gestation and involves most if not all acinar cells. The DNA-binding activity of the pancreas-specific transcription factor PTF1, which binds to enhancers of genes expressed in this tissue, is detected for the first time at day 15 of gestation. The appearance of the factor at this early stage of development suggests that it plays an important role during pancreas differentiation.",0
22156401,Unrestricted quality of seeds in European broad-leaved tree species growing at the cold boundary of their distribution,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The low-temperature range limit of tree species may be determined by their ability to produce and disperse viable seeds. Biological processes such as flowering, pollen transfer, pollen tube growth, fertilization, embryogenesis and seed maturation are expected to be affected by cold temperatures. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of seeds of nine broad-leaved tree species close to their elevational limit. METHODS: We studied nine, mostly widely distributed, European broad-leaved tree species in the genera Acer, Fagus, Fraxinus, Ilex, Laburnum, Quercus, Sorbus and Tilia. For each species, seeds were collected from stands close to optimal growth conditions (low elevation) and from marginal stands (highest elevation), replicated in two regions in the Swiss Alps. Measurements included seed weight, seed size, storage tissue quality, seed viability and germination success. KEY RESULTS: All species examined produced a lot of viable seeds at their current high-elevation range limit during a summer ranked 'normal' by long-term temperature records. Low- and high-elevation seed sources showed hardly any trait differences. The concentration of non-structural carbohydrates tended to be higher at high elevation. Additionally, in one species, Sorbus aucuparia, all measured traits showed significantly higher seed quality in high-elevation seed sources. CONCLUSIONS: For the broad-leaved tree taxa studied, the results are not in agreement with the hypothesis of reduced quality of seeds in trees at their high-elevation range limits. Under the current climatic conditions, seed quality does not constitute a serious constraint in the reproduction of these broad-leaved tree species at their high-elevation limit.",0
18235502,Negative regulation of the deacetylase SIRT1 by DBC1,"SIRT1 is an NAD-dependent deacetylase critically involved in stress responses, cellular metabolism and, possibly, ageing. The tumour suppressor p53 represents the first non-histone substrate functionally regulated by acetylation and deacetylation; we and others previously found that SIRT1 promotes cell survival by deacetylating p53 (refs 4-6). These results were further supported by the fact that p53 hyperacetylation and increased radiation-induced apoptosis were observed in Sirt1-deficient mice. Nevertheless, SIRT1-mediated deacetylase function is also implicated in p53-independent pathways under different cellular contexts, and its effects on transcriptional factors such as members of the FOXO family and PGC-1alpha directly modulate metabolic responses. These studies validate the importance of the deacetylase activity of SIRT1, but how SIRT1 activity is regulated in vivo is not well understood. Here we show that DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) acts as a native inhibitor of SIRT1 in human cells. DBC1-mediated repression of SIRT1 leads to increasing levels of p53 acetylation and upregulation of p53-mediated function. In contrast, depletion of endogenous DBC1 by RNA interference (RNAi) stimulates SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53 and inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis. Notably, these effects can be reversed in cells by concomitant knockdown of endogenous SIRT1. Our study demonstrates that DBC1 promotes p53-mediated apoptosis through specific inhibition of SIRT1.",1

18852347,Mutations of the ANG gene in French patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"BACKGROUND: Mutations in the angiogenin gene, ANG, have been associated recently with familial and sporadic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that link ANG, a multidomain protein, to ALS are still unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of ANG gene mutations in 855 French patients with sporadic ALS. DESIGN: We analyzed by direct sequencing the full coding region of the ANG gene in a cohort of French patients with sporadic ALS. The clinical characteristics of patients carrying ANG mutations are detailed. SETTING: French ALS Study Group. Patients A total of 855 patients with sporadic ALS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of genetic analyses. RESULTS: We observed a previously identified mutation (pI46V) in 2 patients with ALS without a known family link and found a novel mutation (pR121H) in 1 patient who developed ALS with rapid progression. We did not observe an association between patients with ALS and the rs11701 polymorphism, as previously reported in certain ALS populations of other ethnic origins. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings support the implication of ANG gene mutations as a rare but widespread cause of ALS.",1
7671311,A checkpoint regulates the rate of progression through S phase in S. cerevisiae in response to DNA damage,"We demonstrate that in S. cerevisiae the rate of ongoing S phase is slowed when the DNA is subjected to alkylation. Slowing of replication is dependent on the MEC1 and RAD53 genes, indicating that lesions alone do not slow replication in vivo and that the slowing is an active process. While it has been shown that a MEC1- and RAD53-dependent checkpoint responds to blocked replication or DNA damage by inhibiting the onset of mitosis, we demonstrate that this checkpoint must also have an additional target within S phase that controls replication rate. MEC1 is a homolog of the human ATM gene, which is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients. Like mec1 yeast, AT cells are characterized by damage-resistant DNA synthesis, highlighting the congruence of the yeast and mammalian systems.",1
17077150,Akt1 deficiency affects neuronal morphology and predisposes to abnormalities in prefrontal cortex functioning,"There is accumulating evidence that AKT signaling plays a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We asked whether Akt1 deficiency in mice results in structural and functional abnormalities in prefrontal cortex (PFC). Exploratory transcriptional profiling revealed concerted alterations in the expression of PFC genes controlling synaptic function, neuronal development, myelination, and actin polymerization, and follow-up ultrastructural analysis identified consistent changes in the dendritic architecture of pyramidal neurons. Behavioral analysis indicated that Akt1-mutant mice have normal acquisition of a PFC-dependent cognitive task but abnormal working memory retention under neurochemical challenge of three distinct neurotransmitter systems. Thus, Akt1 deficiency creates a context permissive for gene-gene and gene-environment interactions that modulate PFC functioning and contribute to the disease risk associated with this locus, the severity of the clinical syndrome, or both.",1

Intra- and inter-assay variation of the method was 0.5-0.8 and 1.5-2.9%, respectively. The fructosamine concentration in serum was found to be stable for at least 10 days independent of prevailing serum glucose concentration is stored at +4 degrees C or colder. Stability of serum fructosamine with respect to rapid fluctuations of blood glucose was of the same order as that of HbA1c. The reference interval (mean +/- 2 SD) for 92 non-diabetic individuals was 1.9-2.7 mmol/l. Good correlation was found between HbA1c and serum fructosamine (r = 0.79). Serum fructosamine and HbA1c correlated well with the mean blood glucose values of the preceding week (r = 0.88 and 0.75, respectively, p less than 0.001). Significant correlations of fructosamine and HbA1c with fasting blood glucose were also found (r = 0.53 and 0.55, respectively, p less than 0.001). Fructosamine determined simultaneously with fasting blood glucose in 65 oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) did not separate normal subjects from those with impaired glucose tolerance. Two of the three subjects with diabetic response in the OGTT had, however, elevated fructosamine concentrations. Determination of serum fructosamine is a technically simple, reproducible and moderately inexpensive method for the assessment of glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus. Standardization of the method is, however, not without problems. Uniformity of the calibration and assay protocol is essential for reliable interlaboratory comparison of results. Physiological states altering the rate of synthesis or elimination of serum proteins should be considered in the interpretation of fructosamine levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0

They were lowest in the atrophic tonsils of children and in adult tonsils. The results are discussed in their relevance to the overall immunological function of the faucial tonsil.,0
10482951,"A previously unrecognised phenotype characterised by obesity, muscular hypotonia, and ability to speak in patients with Angelman syndrome caused by an imprinting defect","The clinical features of Angelman syndrome (AS) comprise severe mental retardation, postnatal microcephaly, macrostomia and prognathia, absence of speech, ataxia, and a happy disposition. We report on seven patients who lack most of these features, but presented with obesity, muscular hypotonia and mild mental retardation. Based on the latter findings, the patients were initially suspected of having Prader-Willi syndrome. DNA methylation analysis of SNRPN and D15S63, however, revealed an AS pattern, ie the maternal band was faint or absent. Cytogenetic studies and microsatellite analysis demonstrated apparently normal chromosomes 15 of biparental inheritance. We conclude that these patients have an imprinting defect and a previously unrecognised form of AS. The mild phenotype may be explained by an incomplete imprinting defect or by cellular mosaicism.",1
21929076,Language organization and temporal correlations in the spiking activity of an excitable laser: experiments and model comparison,"We introduce a method, based on symbolic analysis, to characterize the temporal correlations of the spiking activity exhibited by excitable systems. The technique is applied to the experimentally observed dynamics of a semiconductor laser with optical feedback operating in the low-frequency fluctuations regime, where the laser intensity displays irregular trains of sudden dropouts that can be interpreted as excitable pulses. Symbolic analysis transforms the series of interdropout time intervals into sequences of words, which represent the local ordering of a certain (small) number of those intervals. We then focus on the transition probabilities between pairs of words, showing that certain transitions are overrepresented (resulting in others being underrepresented) with respect to the surrogate series, provided the laser injection current is above a critical value. These experimental observations are in very good agreement with numerical simulations of the delay-differential Lang-Kobayashi model that is commonly used to describe this laser system, which supports the fact that the language organization reported here is generic and not a particular feature of the specific laser employed or the experimental time series analyzed. We also present results of simulations of the phenomenological nondelayed Eguia-Mindlin-Giudici(EMG) model and find that in this model the agreement between the experiments and the simulations is good at a qualitative, but not at a quantitative, level.",0
8415725,Identification in the HLA class I region of a gene expressed late in keratinocyte differentiation,"A gene designated S has been identified in the class I region of the human major histocompatibility complex. The S gene is located 160 kb telomeric of HLA-C. It is expressed at high levels as 2.2-kb and 2.6-kb mRNAs in human skin. No homologous transcripts were detected in other tissues including placenta, liver, spleen, thymus, and brain. In situ hybridization showed that S gene expression was restricted to the differentiating keratinocytes in the granular layer of the epidermis. The predicted amino acid sequence of the S protein was remarkable for its high content of serine, glycine, and proline. There were significant similarities with the amino acid sequences of loricrin, keratin 1, and keratin 10, all major components of the granular-cell layer. The selective expression of the S gene in the granular-cell layer in the epidermis suggests a role in the developmental program of differentiating keratinocytes. Furthermore, in light of the recognized association of psoriasis vulgaris, a disorder of keratinocyte proliferation, with alleles of HLA-C, this gene may contribute primarily to the pathogenesis of this common disorder.",1
3215394,Hyaluronate accumulation and nerve-dependent growth during regeneration of larval Ambystoma limbs,"Hyaluronate-mediated expansion of the extracellular matrix has been suggested as an important element of growth and morphogenesis in several developing systems. In vitro, various growth factors have been shown to stimulate hyaluronate synthesis as well as cell proliferation. A similar link between proliferation and hyaluronate production during in vivo growth is difficult to demonstrate, because in most systems the source of growth-promoting factors is either not known or not amenable to experimental manipulation. During amphibian limb regeneration, cell proliferation depends upon paracrine release of factors from axons in the limb stump, and the nerve supply can be eliminated or augmented experimentally for study of growth in this system. Denervated and amputated limbs of larval salamanders do not begin to regenerate until distal areas of the limb stumps are reinnervated. We have used such limbs to examine the effect exerted by the reappearance of nerves on the amount of hyaluronate in the tissue undergoing the growth response. Hyaluronate was demonstrated by the metachromatic dye Ethyl Stains-all, which stains hyaluronate blue while sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteins in the extracellular matrix stain various shades of violet, and by microspectrophotometry of alcian-blue-stained GAGs in serial sections pretreated with buffer or with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (SH) to remove hyaluronate specifically. Both methods showed little hyaluronate in the distal region of limb stumps prior to reinnervation, while reinnervated stumps had amounts of hyaluronate similar to those of control blastemas. Autoradiography of 3H-glucosamine-labeled limbs indicated that hyaluronate in the blastemas of reinnervated limb stumps included material newly synthesized by cells throughout the growing tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
10861784,Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) diminishes susceptibility of the oligodendroglial lineage to AMPA glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity,"Prior reports demonstrated that cells of the oligodendroglial lineage are susceptible to excitotoxic necrosis mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid glutamate receptors (AMPA-GluR), and also showed that these cells express the high affinity neurotrophin receptors, TrkC and TrkA. We now report that: a) oligodendroglial progenitors (OP) and immature oligodendroglia are more vulnerable to AMPA-GluR-mediated excitotoxicity than are mature oligodendroglia; b) TrkC expression falls substantially during differentiation of cultured OP to mature oligodendroglia, whereas TrkA expression increases markedly; and c) neurotrophin-3, and to a lesser extent, nerve growth factor, protect the oligodendroglial lineage against AMPA-GluR-mediated excitotoxicity.",0
16818530,"Effects of open-loop feedback on physical activity and television viewing in overweight and obese children: a randomized, controlled trial","OBJECTIVES: Television viewing and physical inactivity increase the risk of obesity in youth. Thus, identifying new interventions that increase physical activity and reduce television viewing would be helpful in the prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity. This study evaluated the effects of open-loop feedback plus reinforcement versus open-loop feedback alone on physical activity, targeted sedentary behavior, body composition, and energy intake in youth. METHODS: Thirty overweight or obese 8- to 12-year-old children were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 14) or control group (n = 16). Participants wore accelerometers every day for 8 weeks and attended biweekly meetings to download the activity monitors. For children in the open-loop feedback plus reinforcement (intervention) group, accumulating 400 counts of physical activity on pedometers earned 1 hour of television/VCR/DVD time, which was controlled by a Token TV electronic device. Open-loop feedback control subjects wore activity monitors but had free access to targeted sedentary behavior. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the open-loop feedback plus reinforcement group demonstrated significantly greater increases in daily physical activity counts (+65% vs +16%) and minutes per day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (+9.4 vs +0.3) and greater reductions in minutes per day spent in television viewing (-116.1 vs +14.3). The intervention group also showed more favorable changes in body composition, dietary fat intake, and energy intake from snacks compared with controls. Reductions in sedentary behavior were directly related to reductions in BMI, fat intake, snack intake, and snack intake while watching television. CONCLUSIONS: Providing feedback of physical activity in combination with reinforcing physical activity with sedentary behavior is a simple method of modifying the home environment that may play an important role in treating and preventing child obesity.",0
8760372,Kinetics of the non-specific calcium leak from non-mitochondrial calcium stores in permeabilized A7r5 cells,"We have investigated the detailed kinetics of the passive Ca2+ leak from non-mitochondrial Ca2+ stores in permeabilized A7r5 cells. The decrease in the content of stored Ca2+ in the presence of 2 microM thapsigargin deviated from a single-exponential curve in the initial phase of the efflux. The deviation persisted after correcting this efflux for passively bound Ca2+. The non-single-exponential nature of the spontaneous release also occurred when the initial store Ca2+ content was reduced to 40% of its original value by pretreatment with 200 nM inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). The passive Ca2+ leak could be modelled by two exponential curves with discrete rate constants of 0.06 min-1 and 0.98 min-1, and not by any other type of non-exponential decay. We concluded that individual store units are heterogeneous with respect to their passive Ca2+ permeability. This non-exponential nature of the passive Ca2+ release is unrelated to the non-single-exponential InsP3-induced Ca2+ release.",0
29993311,Theranostic niosomes for direct intratumoral injection: marked enhancement in tumor retention and anticancer efficacy,"AIM: For simultaneous bioimaging and drug delivery via direct intratumoral injection, doxorubicin and Ag2S quantum dots co-loaded multifunctional niosomes were prepared and fully characterized. MATERIALS & METHODS: Various theranostic niosomes were prepared and investigated regarding cytotoxicity, in vivo imaging, drug accumulation in breast cancer tumor and antitumor activity. RESULTS: Niosomes composed of Tween-60, Tween-80 or Span 60 produced strong and more durable detectable fluorescence signals. Despite a higher accumulation of Tween-60 niosomes in tumor, the Span 60 formulation showed the highest antitumor efficacy when compared with the free drug (71.7 and 20.3% inhibition in tumor growth, respectively). CONCLUSION: Direct intratumoral injection of theranostic niosomes with appropriate composition could be a powerful tool for combined multimodal imaging and therapy.",0

The motion of the elbow, forearm and wrist were also recorded and angle-angle diagrams were mathematically analysed to provide quantitative parameters regarding the control and co-ordination of the joints of the normal and the arthritic upper limb. Two parameters (slope and movement area quotient) were derived and used in the interpretation of joint motion during different activities.",0
27647402,Lack of progesterone receptor expression predicts poor prognosis in patients with operable ER-positive invasive breast cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of lack of progesterone receptor (PR) expression on the prognosis of patients with operable ER (estrogen receptor)-positive invasive breast cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological features, treatment and survival data of 318 women with ER+ /PR+ and ER+ /PR- invasive breast cancer. RESULTS: Among the 318 patients, there were 219 PR-positive and 99 PR-negative cases. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 92.5%, and the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 87.2% in the 318 ER-positive patients. Among them, the 5-year OS rates were significantly different between the PR-positive group (94.6%) and PR-negative group (87.8%, P=0.020), and the 5-year DFS rates were also significantly different from each other (89.8% and 81.6%, respectively, P=0.019). Univariate analysis showed that PR status, tumor size, T stage, axillary lymph node metastasis, and clinical stage were prognostic factors for OS (P<0.05 for all). Multivariate analysis showed that lack of PR expression, T stage >/=2, and positive axillary lymph node metastasis were independent risk factors for poor DFS and OS in ER-positive breast cancer patients (P<0.05 for all). Subgroup analysis showed that lack of PR expression was not significant in predicting poor DFS or OS when patients were in stage  or with a small tumor (</=2 cm) (P>0.05 for all), and also showed that premenopausal women with PR-negative disease had poorer DFS and OS than PR-positive patients (P<0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Lack of PR expression is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in patients with operable ER-positive invasive breast cancer, especially in patients with a large tumor (>2 cm), advanced clinical stage (Stage  or ) or in premenopausal status.",0
18795489,Combined positron emission tomography-computed tomography: the historical perspective,"The 1990s witnessed the development of the first dual-modality imaging devices for clinical applications. A combined PET-CT prototype underwent clinical evaluation from mid-1998 onward. The results from the three-year evaluation program stimulated the demand for commercial designs and in 2001 the first commercial PET-CT scanner was installed in the clinic. The availability of designs from all the major vendors of medical imaging equipment was followed by a rapid adoption of the technology and today, over 2500 PET-CT scanners are in clinical operation world-wide. This article briefly summarizes the short history of PET-CT, and reviews the current status of the technology.",0

25205402,"Two male adults with pathogenic AUTS2 variants, including a two-base pair deletion, further delineate the AUTS2 syndrome","AUTS2 syndrome is characterized by low birth weight, feeding difficulties, intellectual disability, microcephaly and mild dysmorphic features. All affected individuals thus far were caused by chromosomal rearrangements, variants at the base pair level disrupting AUTS2 have not yet been described. Here we present the full clinical description of two affected men with intragenic AUTS2 variants (one two-base pair deletion in exon 7 and one deletion of exon 6). Both variants are de novo and are predicted to cause a frameshift of the full-length transcript but are unlikely to affect the shorter 3' transcript starting in exon 9. The similarities between the phenotypes of both men are striking and further support that AUTS2 syndrome is a single gene disorder. ",1
11732077,A study of marketing and its effect on infant feeding practices,"A baby milk market was created in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and was conceived through the mutual attraction of the manufacturers and doctors. This has partly attributed to the change from breast to artificial feeding. This study was conducted to determine whether marketing had any effect on infant feeding practices. Fifty Malay mothers whose last child was aged less than five years were asked, by questionnaire and by interview, to identify whether several marketing methods influenced their decision on the selection of infant feeding practice. It was found that these mothers felt milk advertisements on television were attractive (72%), were influenced by others to buy a particular brand of formula (38.4%), were influenced by free milk samples to buy a particular brand of milk formula (65.2%) and were not influenced by their doctors on the chosen method of feeding (68%). More studies should be conducted on a bigger sample in other settings and targeting other methods of marketing to substantiate the above results. Further, similar studies among Chinese and Indian mothers are also required.",0
21891908,Sequence of oral manifestations in rhino-maxillary mucormycosis,"Mucormycosis, caused by saprophytic fungi of the order Mucorales of the class Zygomycetes, is a rare opportunistic fungal infection, which has a rapidly progressive and fulminant course with fatal outcome. These fungi are ubiquitous, found in soil, bread molds, decaying fruits and vegetables. The most common form of mucormycosis is rhinocerebral and is usually seen in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or in immunocompromised patients. This fungus invades the arteries, leading to thrombosis that subsequently causes necrosis of hard and soft tissues. We report a case of palatal perforation by rhino-maxillary mucormycosis in an immunocompromised patient. The aim of this article is to draw attention to the clinical presentation and pathogenesis of mucormycosis and to emphasize the need for high degree of suspicion in its diagnosis and management.",0
9278173,Transcription initiation sites for sorghum mitochondrial atp9 are positioned immediately 3' to trnfM,"Sorghum mitochondrial atp9 is polymorphic among male-sterile cytoplasms, but each cytoplasm is characterized by a major 650 nt transcript, regardless of fertility status. The gene is positioned 323 bp 3' to trnfM. Primer extension revealed multiple atp9 5' transcript termini, distributed from +1 to +28 3' to trnfM; the termini could be labeled with polynucleotide kinase, suggesting that they result from the maturation of trnfM. Guanylyltransferase experiments, however, showed that four of the termini were capable. The juxtaposition of a putative promoter 3' to trnfM results in a unique atp9 transcript population consisting of primary and processed transcripts.",0
22296983,Stent design lowers angiographic but not clinical adverse events in stenting of symptomatic intracranial stenosis - results of a single center study with 100 consecutive patients,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Comparing safety and technical success of balloon-expandable stents and self-expanding stents for intracranial angioplasty and stenting in medically refractory intracranial atherosclerotic disease in a single center series. METHODS: Fifty-four self-expanding stents and 46 balloon-expandable stents were implanted in 100 consecutive patients (mean age 64 years, 74% male) from April 2000 to September 2009. All patients had symptomatic intracranial stenosis (anterior circulation, n = 40; posterior circulation, n = 60), presenting with recurrent transient ischemic attack or stroke under antithrombotic treatment. Mean degree of stenosis before treatment was 83 +/- 13%. We assessed safety, defined as any stroke or death during the procedure and at 30 days follow-up, and technical success, defined as accurate delivery of the stent at the site of the target lesion. RESULTS: Safety - periprocedural stroke or hemorrhage occurred in 11 patients treated with balloon-expandable stent, and in 14 of the patients treated with a self-expanding stent. One patient with a balloon-expandable stent died because of acute vessel rupture during treatment. One balloon-expandable stent and one self-expanding stent patient developed a severe reperfusion hemorrhage that resulted in death. Overall, the combined stroke and death rate at 30-day follow-up was 25.0% (23.9% for balloon-expandable stent group and 25.9% for the self-expanding stent group, P = 0.84). Technical success - intracranial angioplasty and stenting was technically successful in 96.3% of the self-expanding stent and 89.1% of the balloon-expandable stent patients (P = 0.31). Vascular complications were significantly less frequent in patients treated with a self-expanding stent (11.1%) than with a balloon-expandable stent (36.9%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Despite a high technical success, the rate of clinical adverse events at 30 days after intracranial angioplasty and stenting is high independently of the stent design. Thus, further development of intracranial stent systems and careful patient selection are mandatory.",0
11929916,Glutamate uptake controls expression of a slow postsynaptic current mediated by mGluRs in cerebellar Purkinje cells,"At the cerebellar parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse, isolated presynaptic activity induces fast excitatory postsynaptic currents via ionotropic glutamate receptors while repetitive, high-frequency, presynaptic activity can also induce a slow excitatory postsynaptic current that is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1-EPSC). Here we investigated the involvement of glutamate uptake in the expression of the mGluR1-EPSC. Inhibitors of glutamate uptake led to a large increase of the mGluR1-EPSC. D-aspartate (0.4 mM) and L(-)-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate (0.4 mM) increased the mGluR1-EPSC approximately 4.5 and approximately 9-fold, respectively, while dihydrokainic acid (1 mM), had no significant effect on the mGluR1-EPSC. D-aspartate (0.4 mM) shifted the concentration-response curve of the depression of the mGluR1-EPSC by the low-affinity mGluR1 antagonist (S)-a-Methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine [(S)-MCPG] to higher concentrations and decreased the stimulus intensity and the number of necessary stimuli to evoke an mGluR1-EPSC. Depression of the mGluR1-EPSC by rapid pressure application of (S)-MCPG at varying time intervals after tetanic stimulation of the parallel fibers indicated that the glutamate concentration in the peri- and extrasynaptic space decayed with time constants of 36 and 316 ms under control conditions and with inhibition of glutamate uptake, respectively. These results show that expression of the slow mGluR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current is controlled by glutamate transporter activity. Thus in contrast to fast glutamatergic synaptic transmission, metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated transmission is critically dependent on the activity and capacity of glutamate uptake.",0
32147432,Ninjurin-1 upregulated by TNFalpha receptor 1 stimulates monocyte adhesion to human TNFalpha-activated endothelial cells; benefic effects of amlodipine,"AIMS: The objectives of the present study were to investigate the mechanisms of Ninj-1 regulation in TNFalpha-activated human endothelial cells (HEC), and to test if Amlodipine (AML) ameliorates the inflammatory stress by decreasing Ninj-1 expression. MAIN METHODS: TNFalpha-activated HEC with/without AML (0.1 muM and 1 muM) were used. TNFalpha-receptor 1 (TNFR1) was silenced and inhibitors for oxidative stress (N-acetyl cysteine), endoplasmic reticulum stress (salubrinal, 4-phenyl butyric acid), or NF-kB (Bay 11-7085) and p38 MAPK (SB203580) were used. Levels of Ninj-1, TNFR1, monocyte adhesion, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) sensors, NADPH oxidase- and mitochondria-derived oxidative species were evaluated. KEY FINDINGS: The novel findings that we report here are: (i) silencing the endothelial TNFR1 leads to decreased Ninj-1 expression and diminished monocyte adhesion; (ii) increased oxidative stress, ERS and NF-kB activation enhance Ninj-1 expression and monocyte adhesion; (iii) up-regulation of endothelial Ninj-1 expression stimulates monocytes adhesion to TNFalpha - activated HEC; (iv) AML diminishes monocyte adhesion by reducing Ninj-1 expression through mechanisms involving the decrease of NADPH oxidase and mitochondria-dependent oxidative stress, ERS and NF-kB. In addition, AML alleviates apoptosis by reducing the pro-apoptotic CHOP expression and re-establishing the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. SIGNIFICANCE: The results of the present study suggest that Ninj-1 and the proteins involved in its regulation can be considered therapeutic targets for the alleviation of inflammation- dependent disorders. In addition, we demonstrate that some of the benefic effects of AML can be achieved through regulation of Ninj-1.",0
28950479,Unilateral regulation breaks regularity of Turing patterns,"We consider a reaction-diffusion system undergoing Turing instability and augment it by an additional unilateral source term. We investigate its influence on the Turing instability and on the character of resulting patterns. The nonsmooth positively homogeneous unilateral term tauv^{-} has favorable properties, but the standard linear stability analysis cannot be performed. We illustrate the importance of the nonsmoothness by a numerical case study, which shows that the Turing instability can considerably change if we replace this term by its arbitrarily precise smooth approximation. However, the nonsmooth unilateral term and all its approximations yield qualitatively similar patterns although not necessarily developing from small disturbances of the spatially homogeneous steady state. Further, we show that the unilateral source breaks the approximate symmetry and regularity of the classical patterns and yields asymmetric and irregular patterns. Moreover, a given system with a unilateral source produces spatial patterns even for diffusion parameters with ratios closer to 1 than the same system without any unilateral term.",0
24363309,Fine temporal structure of cardiorespiratory synchronization,"Cardiac and respiratory rhythms are known to exhibit a modest degree of phase synchronization, which is affected by age, diseases, and other factors. We study the fine temporal structure of this synchrony in healthy young, healthy elderly, and elderly subjects with coronary artery disease. We employ novel time-series analysis to explore how phases of oscillations go in and out of the phase-locked state at each cycle of oscillations. For the first time we show that cardiorespiratory system is engaged in weakly synchronized dynamics with a very specific temporal pattern of synchrony: the oscillations go out of synchrony frequently, but return to the synchronous state very quickly (usually within just 1 cycle of oscillations). Properties of synchrony depended on the age and disease status. Healthy subjects exhibited more synchrony at the higher (1:4) frequency-locking ratio between respiratory and cardiac rhythms, whereas subjects with coronary artery disease exhibited relatively more 1:2 synchrony. However, multiple short desynchronization episodes prevailed regardless of the age and disease status. The same average synchrony level could be alternatively achieved with few long desynchronizations, but this was not observed in the data. This implies functional importance of short desynchronization dynamics. These dynamics suggest that a synchronous state is easy to create if needed but is also easy to break. Short desynchronization dynamics may facilitate the mutual coordination of cardiac and respiratory rhythms by creating intermittent synchronous episodes. It may be an efficient background dynamics to promote adaptation of cardiorespiratory coordination to various external and internal factors. ",0
2416262,A human cell-surface antigen defined by a monoclonal antibody and controlled by a gene on human chromosome 1,"An antigen expressed by most human cells, but not erythrocytes, has been defined by a murine monoclonal antibody, TRA-2-10. This antigen is expressed on the surface of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids, and segregation analysis indicates that it is controlled by a gene located on human chromosome 1. From lysates of most human cells, surface-labelled with 125I, TRA-2-10 immunoprecipitates two polypeptides with molecular weights in the range of about 55 000 to 73 000 depending upon the cell line. Since the TRA-2-10 polypeptides from a fibroblast cell strain and a hepatoma cell line from one individual differ, we conclude that the observed difference in molecular weight has an epigenetic origin.",1
15928895,Experimental study of bone formation around a titanium rod with beta-tricalcium phosphate and prostaglandin E2 receptor agonists,"beta-Tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) is an excellent bone-filling material that is completely absorbed by the body and replaced by autologous bone. Unfortunately, its mechanical strength is low, rendering its application at loaded regions difficult. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the histological and mechanical effects of single and combined use of beta-TCP and EP4 agonist on bone formation around a titanium rod. beta-TCP was loaded into the femoral bone marrow from the distal end of the femur, where the titanium implants were inserted, and the animals received twice-daily subcutaneous injections of EP4 agonist. Group I received the rod only and was designated the control group; group II received EP4 agonist only; group III received beta-TCP only; and group IV received both beta-TCP and EP4 agonist. Examination of decalcified specimens revealed favorable bone formation in all treatment groups compared with that in group I, with the most active bone formation seen in group IV. Mechanical evaluation revealed significant differences in maximum pull-out force compared with group I at weeks 4 and 8. There were no differences between groups II and III at either week 4 or 8, but the values seen in group IV at weeks 4 and 8 were significantly higher compared with the other groups. Combined use of beta-TCP and EP4 agonist is expected to compensate for bone defects resulting from revision total joint arthroplasty and to achieve stability at an early stage.",0
2218890,Circadian esophageal motor function in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease,"Effective esophageal peristalsis is a major determinant of esophageal clearance function and may contribute to the development of complications in gastroesophageal reflux disease. Using 24-hour ambulatory esophageal manometry, we compared the circadian esophageal motor activity of normal volunteers to that of patients with increased esophageal exposure to gastric juice and various grades of mucosal injury (no mucosal injury, esophagitis, stricture, or Barrett's esophagus). The prevalence of a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter, esophageal acid exposure time, and the frequency of nonperistaltic esophageal contractions during the supine, upright, and meal periods increased with increasing severity of mucosal injury. The median amplitude of esophageal contractions was compromised only in patients with a mechanically defective sphincter. This was particularly so in patients with stricture or Barrett's esophagus and was associated with an increased frequency of ineffective contractions (less than 30 mm Hg). These data show that esophageal motor function deteriorates with increasing severity of mucosal injury. This appears to be caused by persistent reflux of gastric juice across a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter. The need for surgical correction of a mechanically defective sphincter before the loss of esophageal body function is implicated.",0
23390136,Homozygous and heterozygous disruptions of ANK3: at the crossroads of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders,"AnkyrinG, encoded by the ANK3 gene, is involved in neuronal development and signaling. It has previously been implicated in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia by association studies. Most recently, de novo missense mutations in this gene were identified in autistic patients. However, the causative nature of these mutations remained controversial. Here, we report inactivating mutations in the Ankyrin 3 (ANK3) gene in patients with severe cognitive deficits. In a patient with a borderline intelligence, severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism and sleeping problems, all isoforms of the ANK3 gene, were disrupted by a balanced translocation. Furthermore, in a consanguineous family with moderate intellectual disability (ID), an ADHD-like phenotype and behavioral problems, we identified a homozygous truncating frameshift mutation in the longest isoform of the same gene, which represents the first reported familial mutation in the ANK3 gene. The causality of ANK3 mutations in the two families and the role of the gene in cognitive function were supported by memory defects in a Drosophila knockdown model. Thus we demonstrated that ANK3 plays a role in intellectual functioning. In addition, our findings support the suggested association of ANK3 with various neuropsychiatric disorders and illustrate the genetic and molecular relation between a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders.",1
12244302,"PKB/Akt phosphorylates p27, impairs nuclear import of p27 and opposes p27-mediated G1 arrest","Mechanisms linking mitogenic and growth inhibitory cytokine signaling and the cell cycle have not been fully elucidated in either cancer or in normal cells. Here we show that activation of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, contributes to resistance to antiproliferative signals and breast cancer progression in part by impairing the nuclear import and action of p27. Akt transfection caused cytoplasmic p27 accumulation and resistance to cytokine-mediated G1 arrest. The nuclear localization signal of p27 contains an Akt consensus site at threonine 157, and p27 phosphorylation by Akt impaired its nuclear import in vitro. Akt phosphorylated wild-type p27 but not p27T157A. In cells transfected with constitutively active Akt(T308DS473D)(PKB(DD)), p27WT mislocalized to the cytoplasm, but p27T157A was nuclear. In cells with activated Akt, p27WT failed to cause G1 arrest, while the antiproliferative effect of p27T157A was not impaired. Cytoplasmic p27 was seen in 41% (52 of 128) of primary human breast cancers in conjunction with Akt activation and was correlated with a poor patient prognosis. Thus, we show a novel mechanism whereby Akt impairs p27 function that is associated with an aggressive phenotype in human breast cancer.",1

17182598,"Prolonged, NK cell-mediated antitumor effects of suicide gene therapy combined with monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 against hepatocellular carcinoma","Tumor recurrence rates remain high after curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunomodulatory agents, including chemokines, are believed to enhance the antitumor effects of tumor cell apoptosis induced by suicide gene therapy. We therefore evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of a bicistronic recombinant adenovirus vector (rAd) expressing both HSV thymidine kinase and MCP-1 on HCC cells. Using an athymic nude mouse model (BALB/c-nu/nu), primary s.c. tumors (HuH7; human HCC cells) were completely eradicated by rAd followed by treatment with ganciclovir. The same animals were subsequently rechallenged with HCC cells, tumor development was monitored, and the recruitment or activation of NK cells was analyzed immunohistochemically or by measuring IFN-gamma mRNA expression. Tumor growth was markedly suppressed as compared with that in mice treated with a rAd expressing the HSV thymidine kinase gene alone (p < 0.001). Suppression of tumor growth was associated with the elevation of serum IL-12 and IL-18. During suppression, NK cells were recruited exclusively, and Th1 cytokine gene expression was enhanced in tumor tissues. The antitumor activity, however, was abolished either when the NK cells were inactivated with anti-asialo GM1 Ab or when anti-IL-12 and anti-IL-18 Abs were administered. These results indicate that suicide gene therapy, together with delivery of MCP-1, eradicates HCC cells and exerts prolonged NK cell-mediated antitumor effects in a model of HCC, suggesting a plausible strategy to prevent tumor recurrence.",0
27626798,SUMOFLUX: A Generalized Method for Targeted 13C Metabolic Flux Ratio Analysis,"Metabolic fluxes are a cornerstone of cellular physiology that emerge from a complex interplay of enzymes, carriers, and nutrients. The experimental assessment of in vivo intracellular fluxes using stable isotopic tracers is essential if we are to understand metabolic function and regulation. Flux estimation based on 13C or 2H labeling relies on complex simulation and iterative fitting; processes that necessitate a level of expertise that ordinarily preclude the non-expert user. To overcome this, we have developed SUMOFLUX, a methodology that is broadly applicable to the targeted analysis of 13C-metabolic fluxes. By combining surrogate modeling and machine learning, we trained a predictor to specialize in estimating flux ratios from measurable 13C-data. SUMOFLUX targets specific flux features individually, which makes it fast, user-friendly, applicable to experimental design and robust in terms of experimental noise and exchange flux magnitude. Collectively, we predict that SUMOFLUX's properties realistically pave the way to high-throughput flux analyses.",0

9399903,Novel alleles of the chemokine-receptor gene CCR5,"The CCR5 gene encodes a cell-surface chemokine-receptor molecule that serves as a coreceptor for macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1. Mutations in this gene may alter expression or function of the protein product, thereby altering chemokine binding/signaling or HIV-1 infection of cells that normally express CCR5 protein. Indeed, homozygotes for a 32-bp deletion allele of CCR5 (CCR5-delta 32), which causes a frameshift at amino acid 185, are relatively resistant to HIV-1 infection. Here we report the identification of 16 additional mutations in the coding region of the CCR5 gene, all but 3 of which are codon altering or ",1

15787196,New methods of pathogenic bacteria elimination,The growing bacterial resistance to antibiotics calls for the elaboration of new pathogens elimination strategies. Some of these methods are based on the conjugative transfer of recombinant plasmids able to eliminate pathogenic recipients by plasmid run-away replication or by killing activity of plasmid-encoded bacteriocins. Using live bacteria as donors of plasmid vectors carrying killing determinants requires meeting many safety restrictions in order to eliminate potential biohazard.,0
21307380,Skin intrinsic fluorescence correlates with autonomic and distal symmetrical polyneuropathy in individuals with type 1 diabetes,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether skin intrinsic fluorescence (SIF) was associated with autonomic neuropathy and confirmed distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (CDSP) in 111 individuals with type 1 diabetes (mean age 49 years, mean diabetes duration 40 years). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: SIF was measured using the SCOUT DM device. Autonomic neuropathy was defined as an electrocardiographic abnormal heart rate response to deep breathing (expiration-to-inspiration ratio <1.1). CDSP was defined using the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial clinical exam protocol (the presence of two or more of the following: symptoms, sensory and/or motor signs, and/or reduced/absent tendon reflexes consistent with DSP) confirmed by the presence of an abnormal age-specific vibratory threshold (using a Vibratron II tester). RESULTS: The prevalence of autonomic neuropathy and CDSP were 61 and 66%, respectively. SIF was higher in those with autonomic neuropathy (P < 0.0001). In multivariable analyses controlling for age and updated mean (18-year average) HbA(1c), and allowing for other univariately and clinically significant correlates of autonomic neuropathy, each SD change in SIF was associated with a 2.6-greater likelihood of autonomic neuropathy (P = 0.006). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses revealed that SIF and updated mean HbA(1c) accounted for 80 and 57%, respectively, of the area under the curve (AUC) for autonomic neuropathy. SIF also was higher in those with CDSP (P < 0.0001) and remained so in multivariable analyses (odds ratio 2.70; P = 0.005). ROC analyses revealed that SIF and updated mean HbA(1c) accounted for 78 and 59%, respectively, of the AUC for CDSP. CONCLUSIONS: SIF, a marker of dermal advanced glycation end products, appears to be more strongly associated with the presence of both CDSP and autonomic neuropathy than mean HbA(1c).",0
18507830,Could a defective epithelial sodium channel lead to bronchiectasis,"BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis is defined as a permanent dilation of the airways arising from chronic bronchial inflammation/infection. In 50% of cases, no etiology can be identified. Recently, the role of the epithelial sodium channel ENaC has been pointed out in the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis, a disease due to mutations in the CFTR gene and causing bronchiectasis in the airways. Moreover, it was found that transgenic mice overexpressing ENaCbeta present cystic fibrosis-like lung disease symptoms. Our aim was to evaluate if a defective ENaC protein could be involved in the development of bronchiectasis. METHODS: We extensively analysed ENaCbeta and gamma genes in 55 patients with idiopathic bronchiectasis and without two mutations in the coding regions of CFTR. Thirty-eight patients presented functional abnormalities suggesting impaired sodium transport (abnormal sweat chloride concentration or nasal potential difference measurement), and 17 had no such evidence. RESULTS: Sequencing of the exons and flanking introns of the ENaCbeta and gamma gene identified five different amino-acid changes (p.Ser82Cys, p.Pro369Thr, p.Asn288Ser in ENaCbeta ; and p.Gly183Ser, p.Glu197Lys in ENaCgamma) in heterozygous state in 8 patients. The p.Ser82Cys amino-acid change was found in 3 unrelated patients who were also heterozygous for a CFTR mutation or variant (1 p.F508del, 1 IVS8-5T, and 1 IVS8-5T:1716G>A (p.E528E)). The other mutations were found in patients without CFTR mutation, the p.Glu197Lys mutation in 2 patients and the other variants in single patients. Among the 8 patients bearing an ENaC mutation, 5 had functional abnormalities suggesting impaired sodium transport. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that several variants in ENaCbeta and gamma genes might be deleterious for ENaC function and lead to bronchiectasis, especially in patients who are trans-heterozygotes for ENaCbeta/CFTR mutations or variants.",1
15095973,The C. elegans ceh-36 gene encodes a putative homemodomain transcription factor involved in chemosensory functions of ASE and AWC neurons,"Chemotaxis to water-soluble chemicals such as sodium ion is an important behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans for seeking food, and ASE chemosensory neurons have a major role in this behavior. We isolated mutants defective in chemotaxis to sodium acetate. We show here that among them ks86 had a mutation in the ceh-36 gene. ceh-36 :: gfp reporter constructs were expressed in ASE and AWC neurons. In a mutant of the che-1 gene, which encodes another transcription factor and is required for specification of ASE neurons, expression of the ceh-36 :: gfp reporter in ASE is lost. This indicates that the ceh-36 gene functions downstream of the che-1 gene in ASE. In the ceh-36(ks86) mutant, expression of the tax-2 gene encoding a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel was reduced in ASE and AWC. This affords an explanation for defects of the ceh-36 mutant in the chemotaxis mediated by ASE and AWC. When a ceh-36 cDNA was expressed in an adult ceh-36 mutant by a heat shock promoter, chemotaxis to sodium acetate was recovered. These results suggest that ceh-36 is required for functions, and not for development, of ASE.",0

17150201,Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolaemia: discrimination of ARH protein and LDLR function in the homozygous FH phenotype,"BACKGROUND: Phenocopies of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (hoFH) having autosomal recessive inheritance, were recently found to arise from defects in the LDL receptor (LDLR) adapter protein, called ARH, which facilitates the clearance of circulating LDL. Discrimination between the two causes of the phenotype at a clinical level may not be possible when parents display moderate hypercholesterolaemia. An effective strategy is thus required to identify the appropriate mechanism for the disorder. METHODS: Fibroblast LDL uptake studies were coupled with Western blotting for ARH protein in cell extracts, to identify the defective gene before DNA studies were initiated. Two subjects with the hoFH phenotype, but with indeterminate dyslipidaemia in their parents, were fully worked up. RESULTS: Defective LDL metabolism was established in both patients by functional and protein studies and further confirmed by detecting deleterious mutations, in the LDLR and ARH genes. The ARH patient is the first subject of Negroid identity to be described and records a specific mutation in this racial grouping. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the occasional complexity and uncertainty of a clinical diagnosis of hoFH and presents Western blotting of leucocyte extracts for ARH protein, as a rapid strategy for the detection of ARH before sequencing the gene for mutation(s). This strategy may be particularly useful in populations where founder mutations for ARH and LDLR defects are rare or co-exist.",0
12829588,The nature of diversity and diversification at the ABO locus,"In this study we analyzed the complete genomic sequences, except intron 1, and 2 regulatory regions of 6 common (ABO*A101, ABO*A201, ABO*B101, ABO*O01, ABO*O02, and ABO*O03) and 18 rare ABO alleles, 3 of which were new. This was done by phylogenetic analysis and correlating sequence data with the ABO phenotypes. The study revealed multiple polymorphisms in noncoding regions. The intron-based phylogenetic analysis revealed 5 main lineages: ABO*A, ABO*B, ABO*O01, ABO*O02, and ABO*O03. The genomic sequences of most rare ABO alleles differed slightly from those of the common alleles. Singular mutations or hybrid alleles were most common, but a few exhibited mosaic sequence pattern containing multiple exon and/or intron motifs from other ABO lineages. Thus, both an accumulation of mutations as well as an assortment of the mutations by recombination seems to be responsible for the ABO gene diversity. The prevalence of replacement mutations indicates positive selection for allelic diversity. Phenotype-genotype correlation showed that sequence variations within the complete coding sequence can affect A- and B-antigen expression. All variant ABO*A/B alleles and one new ABO*O03-like allele were associated with weak ABO phenotypes. These findings are suggestive of the requirement of a comprehensive coding sequence database for sequence-based phenotype prediction.",1
7285921,Isolation and characterization of xenopus laevis albumin mRNA,"The messenger RNA for albumin was isolated from the liver of male frogs. Purification was achieved using oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography and sucrose gradient centrifugation under denaturing conditions. As judged by translational activity in a cell-free protein-synthesizing system derived from rabbit reticulocytes, albumin mRNA was enriched 259-fold as compared to the total ribonucleic acid of the liver cells. Purified albumin mRNA migrated after sucrose gradient centrifugation as a single symmetrical peak of approximately 17 S and also moved as a single band following denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Albumin mRNA possess properties compatible with the presence of a poly(adenylic acid) sequence. Translation in vitro yielded a product which is immunoprecipitable with anti-(frog albumin) and which showed a single radioactive peak having a molecular weight of about 74000 in sodium dodecylsulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Complementary DNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase, and, as a template, purified albumin mRNA. Following hybridization under conditions of excess RNA, the rot1/2 of albumin mRNA was found to be 1.8 X 10-3 mol . s . 1-1. This result also confirmed that albumin nRNA had been isolated in a highly purified form.",0
26674290,Heart rate variability and inflammatory response in rats with lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia,"The aim of the study was to evaluate short-term heart rate variability (HRV) as an index of cardiac autonomic control in rats with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia. Animals were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (100 microg/kg b.w.) and control group with an equivalent volume of saline. ECG recordings were done before (base) and 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 min after LPS or saline administration. HRV magnitude was quantified by time and frequency-domain analysis (mean RR interval, SDRR, RMSSD, spectral powers in low (LF) and high frequency (HF) bands. Heart tissue homogenates and plasma were analyzed to determine interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and oxidative stress level (TBARS). Administration of lipopolysaccharide was followed by continuous rise in colonic body temperature compared to saline-treated controls. Endotoxemia in rats was accompanied by significant decrease in HRV spectral activity in high-frequency range at maximal body temperature (logHFpower: 1.2+/-0.5 vs. 1.9+/-0.6 ms(2), P<0.01). Increased IL-6 was found in heart tissue homogenates of LPS rats (8.0+/-0.6 vs. 26.4+/-4.8 pg/ml, (P<0.05). In conclusions, reduced HRV in HF band may indicate a decreased parasympathetic activity in LPS-induced endotoxemia as basic characteristics of altered cardiac control during response to endotoxemia.",0
21944779,A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the cause of chromosome 9p21-linked ALS-FTD,"The chromosome 9p21 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) locus contains one of the last major unidentified autosomal-dominant genes underlying these common neurodegenerative diseases. We have previously shown that a founder haplotype, covering the MOBKL2b, IFNK, and C9ORF72 genes, is present in the majority of cases linked to this region. Here we show that there is a large hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in the first intron of C9ORF72 on the affected haplotype. This repeat expansion segregates perfectly with disease in the Finnish population, underlying 46.0% of familial ALS and 21.1% of sporadic ALS in that population. Taken together with the D90A SOD1 mutation, 87% of familial ALS in Finland is now explained by a simple monogenic cause. The repeat expansion is also present in one-third of familial ALS cases of outbred European descent, making it the most common genetic cause of these fatal neurodegenerative diseases identified to date.",1
12237475,Akt induces enhanced myocardial contractility and cell size in vivo in transgenic mice,"The serine-threonine kinase Akt seems to be central in mediating stimuli from different classes of receptors. In fact, both IGF-1 and IL6-like cytokines induce hypertrophic and antiapoptotic signals in cardiomyocytes through PI3K-dependent Akt activation. More recently, it was shown that Akt is involved also in the hypertrophic and antiapoptotic effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation. Thus, to determine the effects of Akt on cardiac function in vivo, we generated a model of cardiac-specific Akt overexpression in mice. Transgenic mice were generated by using the E40K, constitutively active mutant of Akt linked to the rat alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. The effects of cardiac-selective Akt overexpression were studied by echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, histological and biochemical techniques. We found that Akt overexpression produced cardiac hypertrophy at the molecular and histological levels, with a significant increase in cardiomyocyte cell size and concentric LV hypertrophy. Akt-transgenic mice also showed a remarkable increase in cardiac contractility compared with wild-type controls as demonstrated by the analysis of left ventricular (dP/dt(max)) in an invasive hemodynamic study, although with graded dobutamine infusion, the maximum response was not different from that in controls. Diastolic function, evaluated by left ventricular dP/dt(min), was not affected at rest but was impaired during graded dobutamine infusion. Isoproterenol-induced cAMP levels, beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) density, and beta-AR affinity were not altered compared with control mice. Moreover, studies on signaling pathway activation from myocardial extracts demonstrated that glycogen synthase kinase3-beta is phosphorylated, whereas p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases is not, indicating that Akt induces hypertrophy in vivo by activating the glycogen synthase kinase3-beta/GATA 4 pathway. In summary, our results not only demonstrate that Akt regulates cardiomyocyte cell size in vivo, but, importantly, show that Akt modulates cardiac contractility in vivo without directly affecting beta-AR signaling capacity.",1
30464338,Somatic APP gene recombination in Alzheimer's disease and normal neurons,"The diversity and complexity of the human brain are widely assumed to be encoded within a constant genome. Somatic gene recombination, which changes germline DNA sequences to increase molecular diversity, could theoretically alter this code but has not been documented in the brain, to our knowledge. Here we describe recombination of the Alzheimer's disease-related gene APP, which encodes amyloid precursor protein, in human neurons, occurring mosaically as thousands of variant 'genomic cDNAs' (gencDNAs). gencDNAs lacked introns and ranged from full-length cDNA copies of expressed, brain-specific RNA splice variants to myriad smaller forms that contained intra-exonic junctions, insertions, deletions, and/or single nucleotide variations. DNA in situ hybridization identified gencDNAs within single neurons that were distinct from wild-type loci and absent from non-neuronal cells. Mechanistic studies supported neuronal 'retro-insertion' of RNA to produce gencDNAs; this process involved transcription, DNA breaks, reverse transcriptase activity, and age. Neurons from individuals with sporadic Alzheimer's disease showed increased gencDNA diversity, including eleven mutations known to be associated with familial Alzheimer's disease that were absent from healthy neurons. Neuronal gene recombination may allow 'recording' of neural activity for selective 'playback' of preferred gene variants whose expression bypasses splicing; this has implications for cellular diversity, learning and memory, plasticity, and diseases of the human brain.",1
16369182,Efficiency of tazobactam/piperacillin in lethal peritonitis is enhanced after preconditioning of rats with O3/O2-pneumoperitoneum,"Insufflation of ozonized oxygen into the peritoneum (O3/O2-pneumoperitoneum [O3/O2-PP]) of rats reduced the lethality of peritonitis. We evaluated the prophylactic effect of O3/O2-PP combined with tazobactam/piperacillin (TZP) in polymicrobial lethal peritonitis. Wistar rats were conditioned by daily repeated insufflation of ozone for 5 days, and hematologic parameters were determined. Sepsis was induced by i.p. injection of cecal material derived from donor rats. Simultaneously, TZP was applied at a single dosage of 65 mg/kg or at two dosage schedules of 65 mg/kg each at an interval of 1 h. The conditioning effect of O3/O2-PP on the number of blood cells was measured before inoculation of bacteria. The mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokine IL-lbeta and TNF-alpha were determined at 4 h post infection in spleen and liver by semiquantitative in situ hybridization analysis. Preconditioning of rats by O3/O2-PP enhanced the number of blood leukocytes and granulocytes and increased the survival rate of septic rats up to 33%. The combination of O3/O2-PP and TZP further enhanced the survival rate up to 93%. This effect was accompanied by a reduced amount of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA in spleen and liver. In contrast, in non-infected animals the combination of O3/O2-PP and TZP enhanced IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA in the spleen and IL-1beta mRNA in liver when compared with TZP- and sham-treated controls. The preconditioning effect of O3/O2-PP seems to support the biological effectiveness of TZP by altering the immune status before and during the onset of sepsis. The combined therapy could be a simple, preoperative intervention for abdominal surgery to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality.",0
10790184,DNA-binding proteins of the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi: purification and characterization of an endonuclease,DNA-binding proteins present in fourth instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi were isolated by affinity chromatography on native and denatured DNA cellulose columns and analyzed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. A denatured DNA-specific protein with an approximate molecular weight of 30 kDa was the predominant DNA binding protein of larvae. This protein was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by phosphocellulose chromatography. The purified 30 kDa binding protein showed an endonucleolytic activity capable of converting pBR 322 supercoiled DNA to the circular form. Maximum endonucleolytic activity was observed in the presence of 5 mM Mg(2+) at pH 7.4. Enzyme activity was completely inhibited by EDTA.,0
10330430,Alpha-cardiac actin is a novel disease gene in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"We identified the alpha-cardiac actin gene (ACTC) as a novel disease gene in a pedigree suffering from familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). Linkage analyses excluded all the previously reported FHC loci as possible disease loci in the family studied, with lod scores varying between -2.5 and -6.0. Further linkage analyses of plausible candidate genes highly expressed in the adult human heart identified ACTC as the most likely disease gene, showing a maximal lod score of 3.6. Mutation analysis of ACTC revealed an Ala295Ser mutation in exon 5 close to 2 missense mutations recently described to cause the inherited form of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). ACTC is the first sarcomeric gene described in which mutations are responsible for 2 different cardiomyopathies. We hypothesize that ACTC mutations affecting sarcomere contraction lead to FHC and that mutations affecting force transmission from the sarcomere to the surrounding syncytium lead to IDC.",1
12910268,AID mutant analyses indicate requirement for class-switch-specific cofactors,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is the essential and sole B cell-specific factor required for class-switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). However, it is not known how AID differentially regulates these two independent events. Involvement of several cofactors interacting with AID has been indicated by scattered distribution of loss-of-function point mutations and evolutionary conservation of the entire 198-amino-acid protein. Here, we report that human AID mutant proteins with insertions, replacements or truncations in the C-terminal region retained strong SHM activity but almost completely lost CSR activity. These results indicate that AID requires interaction with a cofactor(s) specific to CSR.",1
14676570,Many mechanisms for hsp70 protection from cerebral ischemia,"Overexpression of inducible Hsp70 has been shown to provide protection from cerebral ischemia both in animal models of stroke and in cell culture models. New work suggests that there are multiple routes of cell death, including apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Hsp70 is known to protect from both necrotic and apoptotic cell death. In addition to the well-studied role of Hsp70 as a molecular chaperone assisting in correct protein folding, several new mechanisms by which Hsp70 can prevent cell death have been described. Hsp70 is now known to regulate apoptotic cell death both directly by interfering with the function of several proteins that induce apoptotic cell death as well as indirectly by increasing levels of the anti-death protein bcl-2. Despite these new insights into the ways in which Hsp70 functions as an anti-death protein, further surprises are likely as we continue to gain insight into the functioning of this multifaceted protein.",0
8797830,"Molecular identification of a major retinoic-acid-synthesizing enzyme, a retinaldehyde-specific dehydrogenase","Retinoic acid, a developmental signal implicated in the formation of the neural axis, is present at high levels in the early embryonic trunk region, where it is synthesized by a novel dehydrogenase. Here we show that the same enzyme is inducible by retinoic acid in P19 teratocarcinoma cells, and we report the cloning from P19 cells of a cDNA encoding a novel dehydrogenase, named retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (RALDH-2). Expression in COS cells shows RALDH-2 to be highly effective in oxidation of retinaldehyde, with no detectable activity on any other aldehyde tested. In situ hybridization histochemistry on the embryonic trunk reveals RALDH-2 mRNA both in mesoderm and neuroectoderm, with highest neuroectodermal expression in the ventral horn of the spinal cord at two restricted locations along the anteroposterior axis, presumably the subpopulation of motoneurons that innervate the limbs.",1
18309046,Protein synthesis and neurotrophin-dependent structural plasticity of single dendritic spines,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamatergic synapses is considered to underlie learning and memory and is associated with the enlargement of dendritic spines. Because the consolidation of memory and LTP require protein synthesis, it is important to clarify how protein synthesis affects spine enlargement. In rat brain slices, the repetitive pairing of postsynaptic spikes and two-photon uncaging of glutamate at single spines (a spike-timing protocol) produced both immediate and gradual phases of spine enlargement in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The gradual enlargement was strongly dependent on protein synthesis and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) action, often associated with spine twitching, and was induced specifically at the spines that were immediately enlarged by the synaptic stimulation. Thus, this spike-timing protocol is an efficient trigger for BDNF secretion and induces protein synthesis-dependent long-term enlargement at the level of single spines.",1

30222608,"Coordinating the prevention, treatment, and care continuum for HIV-associated tuberculosis in prisons: a health systems strengthening approach","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To advance a re-conceptualized prevention, treatment, and care continuum (PTCC) for HIV-associated tuberculosis (TB) in prisons, and to make recommendations for strengthening prison health systems and reducing HIV-associated TB morbidity and mortality throughout the cycle of pretrial detention, incarceration, and release. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite evidence of increased HIV-associated TB burden in prisons compared to the general population, prisoners face entrenched barriers to accessing anti-TB therapy, antiretroviral therapy, and evidence-based HIV and TB prevention. New approaches, suitable for the complexities of healthcare delivery in prisons, have emerged that may address these barriers, and include: novel TB diagnostics, universal test and treat for HIV, medication-assisted treatment for opioid dependence, comprehensive transitional case management, and peer navigation, among others. SUMMARY: Realizing ambitious international HIV and TB targets in prisons will only be possible by first addressing the root causes of the TB/HIV syndemic, which are deeply intertwined with human rights violations and weaknesses in prison health systems, and, second, fundamentally re-organizing HIV and TB services around a coordinated PTCC. Taking these steps can help ensure universal access to comprehensive, good-quality, free and voluntary TB/HIV prevention, treatment, and care, and advance efforts to strengthen health resourcing, staffing, information management, and primary care access within prisons.",0

In this study, we determine the role of the recently identified gene, HRPT2, in parathyroid tumorigenesis. METHODS: Mutation analysis of HRPT2 was undertaken in 60 parathyroid tumours: five HPT-JT, three FIHP, three MEN 1, one MEN 2A, 25 sporadic adenomas, 17 hyperplastic glands, two lithium associated tumours, and four sporadic carcinomas. Loss of heterozygosity at 1q24-32 was performed on a subset of these tumours. RESULTS: HRPT2 somatic mutations were detected in four of four sporadic parathyroid carcinoma samples, and germline mutations were found in five of five HPT-JT parathyroid tumours (two families) and two parathyroid tumours from one FIHP family. One HPT-JT tumour with germline mutation also harboured a somatic mutation. In total, seven novel and one previously reported mutation were identified. ",1

11415833,Biomechanical evaluation of a central rod system in the treatment of scoliosis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of a central rod system in the treatment of scoliosis. DESIGN: Biomechanical testing and finite element analysis were performed to compare the stiffness and stress distribution of the central rod system with the Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation. BACKGROUND: During the fixation and derotation processes in the treatment of scoliosis, the Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation concentrates unilateral stress on the vertebral elements. It may be possible to cause severe injury to the bony tissues especially in the ostaeoporotic patients. A central rod system was developed to reduce the damage to the bony tissue of the vertebrae in the treatment of scoliosis. METHODS: Mechanical non-destructive cyclical tests comparing the compression, flexion, extension and torsional stiffness were carried out on the models of the central rod system and Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation using a 858 Bionix test system. The stress distribution on the central rod, the Cotrel-Dubousset rod and a vertebral model consisting in four vertebrae each implanted with two screws was evaluated using a general purpose finite element software ANSYS R 5.0a. The SOLID73 element was employed for three-dimensional modelling. RESULTS: Although the central rod system was found to have lower values in the compression, flexion and extension stiffness, its torsional stiffness is comparable to the Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation. Moreover, the stability of the new design is satisfactory. Finite element analysis indicates that the maximum equivalent stress on the vertebral model with the central rod system is relatively constant. CONCLUSIONS: The central rod system consists of a central rod which applies fixation and derotation through a connector between the screws on both sides of the vertebral column. This new design can not only prevent the effect of unilateral stress concentration, but is also simpler and easier to implant. However, it is necessary to strengthen the material of the rod or the connection between the rod and the screws. RELEVANCE: This study employed the methods of biomechanical testing and finite element analysis to evaluate a newly designed central rod system in the treatment of scoliosis. The same methods can be applied to the evaluation of orthopaedic instrumentations in the pre-clinical stage. The efficiency of the central rod system is comparable to the Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation, and its implantation is simpler and easier.",0

We used epsilon-ADP bound to F-actin as a fluorescence donor and 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole bound to troponin-C in troponin as a fluorescence acceptor. The efficiency of the fluorescence energy transfer of this system was larger in the absence of calcium ion than in the presence of calcium ion. This shows that the interaction of troponin with F-actin changes in response to the concentration of calcium ion.",0

Rhnull of the regulator type is caused by RHAG mutation. In this study, a novel nonsense mutation in RHAG gene was identified in a Chinese Rhnull individual. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Rh phenotypes of the Rhnull individual and his family members were typed by standard serological methods. DNA sequences of all ten exons of RHAG gene were analyzed using genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct-sequencing. RESULTS: Serological testing results showed a D-C-c-E-e- phenotype in the proband. Molecular analyses revealed a 540C>A mutation in exon 4 of RHAG gene was present at the homozygous state in the proband. His parents were heterozygous for the mutation, and his brother didn't carry the mutation. The 540C>A mutation was nonsense mutation, which led to a premature stop codon (Tyr180stop). CONCLUSION: These results indicated that the 540C>A nonsense mutation in RHAG gene caused the regulator type of Rhnull phenotype in a Chinese individual. Our results contributed to a greater understanding of the genetic mechanisms of Rhnull phenotype.",0
1646080,"Expression cloning of an activin receptor, a predicted transmembrane serine kinase","Activins are involved in the regulation of multiple biological events, ranging from early development to pituitary function. To characterize the cellular mechanisms involved in these processes, cDNAs coding for an activin receptor were cloned from AtT20 mouse corticotropic cells by screening COS cell transfectants for binding of 125I-activin A. The cDNAs code for a protein of 494 amino acids comprising a ligand-binding extracellular domain, a single membrane-spanning domain, and an intracellular kinase domain with predicted serine/threonine specificity. 125I-activin A binds to transfected COS cells with an affinity of 180 pM and can be competed by activin A, activin B, and inhibin A, but not by transforming growth factor beta 1. The kinase domain, but not the extracellular sequence, of the activin receptor is most closely related to the C. elegans daf-1 gene product, a putative transmembrane serine/threonine-specific protein kinase for which the ligand is not known.",1
68276,"Type-III Hyperlipoproteinaemia (""""remnant removal disease""""). Insight into the pathogenetic mechanism","The metabolism of very-low-density lipoprotein (V.L.D.L.) was studied in a patient with type-III hyperlipoproteinaemia. After injection of radioiodinated V.L.D.L. from a donor with endogenous hypertriglyceridaemia (in a type-IV pattern), clearance of radioactivity from the apoprotein-B moiety of V.L.D.L. was slow and appearance in low-density lipoprotein (L.D.L.) was delayed, suggesting defective catabolism of V.L.D.L. in type-III hyperlipoproteinaemia. Despite a 60% increase in the rate of V.L.D.L. production, therapy with oestrogen (ethinyloestradiol 1 microng/kg/day) resulted in a decrease in plasma-lipid concentrations, normalisation of lipoprotein composition, and correction of the defect in V.L.D.L. catabolism with increased conversion to L.D.L. Thus, in type-III hyperlipoproteinaemia, the primary defect seems to be impaired catabolism of V.L.D.L., which is corrected with oestrogen therapy.",1
29709804,Mus musculus bone fluoride concentration as a useful biomarker for risk assessment of skeletal fluorosis in volcanic areas,"Fluoride is often found in elevated concentrations in volcanic areas due to the release of magmatic fluorine as hydrogen fluorine through volcanic degassing. The exposure to high levels of fluoride can affect the processes of bone formation and resorption causing skeletal fluorosis, a pathology that can easily be mistaken for other skeletal diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine if fluoride concentration in the femoral bone of wild populations of the house mouse (Mus musculus) is a good biomarker of exposure to active volcanic environments naturally enriched in fluoride, allowing their use in biomonitoring programs. The fluoride concentration of the whole femoral bone of 9 mice from Furnas (5 males and 4 females) and 33 mice from Rabo de Peixe (16 males and 17 females) was measured by the potentiometric method with a fluoride ion selective electrode. Fluoride in bones was significantly higher in the mice from Furnas when compared with the mice from Rabo de Peixe (616.5+/-129.3mugF/g vs. 253.8+/-10.5mugF/g). Accumulation rates were also significantly higher in the mice collected in Furnas when compared with Rabo de Peixe individuals (3.84+/-0.52mugF/day vs. 1.22+/-0.06mugF/day). The results demonstrate a significant association between exposure to fluoride in the active volcanic environment and fluoride content in bone, revealing that bone fluoride concentration is a suitable biomarker of chronic environmental exposure to fluoride.",0
26153688,Highly Conductive Aromatic Functionalized Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotube for Inkjet Printable High Performance Supercapacitor Electrodes,"We report the functionalization of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) via the 1,3-dipolar [3+2] cycloaddition of aromatic azides, which resulted in a detangled CNT as shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Carboxylic moieties (-COOH) on aromatic azide result in highly stable aqueous dispersion (max. conc. ~ 10 mg/mL H2O), making the suitable for inkjet printing. Printed patterns on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible substrate exhibit low sheet resistivity ~65 Omega. cm, which is attributed to enhanced conductivity. Fabricated Supercapacitors (SC) assembled using these printed substrates exhibit good electrochemical performance in organic as well as aqueous electrolytes. High energy and power density (57.8 Wh/kg and 0.85 kW/kg) in 1M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed supercapacitor. Capacitive retention varies from ~85-94% with columbic efficiency ~95% after 1000 charge/discharge cycles in different electrolytes, demonstrating the excellent potential of the device for futuristic power applications.

12697740,A mutation in a CD44 variant of inflammatory cells enhances the mitogenic interaction of FGF with its receptor,"Synovial fluid cells from joints of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients express a novel variant of CD44 (designated CD44vRA), encoding an extra trinucleotide (CAG) transcribed from intronic sequences flanking a variant exon. The CD44vRA mutant was detected in 23 out of 30 RA patients. CD44-negative Namalwa cells transfected with CD44vRA cDNA or with CD44v3-v10 (CD44vRA wild type) cDNA bound FGF-2 to an equal extent via their associated heparan sulfate chains. However, Namalwa cells, immobilizing FGF-2 via their cell surface CD44vRA, bound substantially more soluble FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1) than did Namalwa cells immobilizing the same amount of FGF-2 via their cell surface CD44v3-v10. The former cells stimulated the proliferation of BaF-32 cells, bearing FGFR-1, more efficiently than did the latter cells. Finally, isolated primary synovial fluid cells from RA patients expressing CD44vRA bound more soluble FGFR-1 to their cell surface-associated FGF-2 than did corresponding synovial cells expressing CD44v3-v10 or synovial cells from osteoarthritis patients. The binding of soluble FGFR-1 to RA synovial cells could be specifically reduced by their preincubation with Ab's against the v3 exon product of CD44. Hence, FGF-2 attached to the heparan sulfate moiety expressed by the novel CD44 variant of RA synovium cells exhibits an augmented ability to stimulate FGFR-1-mediated activities. A similar mechanism may foster the destructive inflammatory cascade not only in RA, but also in other autoimmune diseases.",1
18610839,C-terminal fragment of ribosomal protein S15 is located at the decoding site of the human ribosome,"Protein S15 is a characteristic component of the mammalian 80S ribosome that neighbors mRNA codon at the decoding site and the downstream triplets. In this study we determined S15 protein fragments located close to mRNA positions +4 to +12 with respect to the first nucleotide of the P site codon on the human ribosome. For cross-linking to ribosomal protein S15, a set of mRNA was used that contained triplet UUU/UUC at the 5'-termini and a perfluorophenyl azide-modified uridine in position 3' of this triplet. The locations of mRNA analogues on the ribosome were governed by tRNAPhe cognate to the UUU/UUC triplet targeted to the P site. Cross-linked S15 protein was isolated from the irradiated with mild UV light complexes of 80S ribosomes with tRNAPhe and mRNA analogues with subsequent cleavage with CNBr that splits polypeptide chain after methionines. Analysis of modified oligopeptides resulted from the cleavage revealed that in all cases cross-linking site was located in C-terminal fragment 111-145 of protein S15 indicating that this fragment is involved in formation of decoding site of the eukaryotic ribosome.",0

28720096,Clinical and radiographic predictors of acute compartment syndrome in the treatment of tibial plateau fractures: a retrospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the relation between demographic, injury-related, clinical and radiological factors of patients with tibial plateau fractures and the development of acute compartment syndrome. METHODS: All consecutive adult patients with intra-articular tibial plateau fractures admitted in our urban academic medical centre between January 2005 and December 2009 were included in this retrospective cohort study. The main outcome measurement was the development of acute compartment syndrome. RESULTS: The charts of 265 patients (mean age 48.6 years) sustaining 269 intra-articular tibial plateau fractures were retrospectively reviewed. Acute compartment syndrome occurred in 28 fractures (10.4%). Four patients presented bilateral tibial plateau fractures; of them, 2 had unilateral, but none had bilateral acute compartment syndrome. Non-contiguous tibia fracture or knee dislocation and higher AO/OTA classification (type 41-C) were statistically significantly associated with the development of acute compartment syndrome in multivariable regression analysis, while younger age (<45 years), male sex, higher Schatzker grade (IV-V-VI), higher tibial widening ratio (>/=1.05) and higher femoral displacement ratio (>/=0.08) were significantly associated in the analysis adjusted for age and sex. CONCLUSIONS: Two parameters related to the occurrence of ACS in tibial plateau fractures were highlighted in this study: the presence of a non-contiguous tibia fracture or knee dislocation, and higher AO/OTA classification. They may be especially useful when clinical findings are difficult to assess (doubtful clinical signs, obtunded, sedated or intubated patients), and should rise the suspicion level of the treating surgeon. In these cases, regular clinical examinations and/or intra-compartmental pressure measurements should be performed before and after surgery, even if acute compartment syndrome seemed unlikely during initial assessment. However, larger studies are mandatory to confirm and refine both factors in predicting the occurrence of acute compartment syndrome.",0
32324286,Phenotypic and genotypic features of a large kindred with a germline AIP variant,"CONTEXT: Acromegaly is usually a sporadic disease, but familial cases occur. Mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) gene are associated with familial pituitary adenoma predisposition. However, the pathogenicity of some AIP variants remains unclear and additional unknown genes may be involved. OBJECTIVE: To explore the phenotype and genotype of a large kindred carrying the p.R304Q AIP variant. METHODS: The family comprised 52 family members at risk of carrying the p.R304Q AIP variant including a case with gigantism and one with acromegaly and several family members with acromegalic features. Nine family members (three trios) underwent exome sequencing to identify putative pathogenic variants. RESULTS: We identified 31 p.R304Q carriers, and based on two cases with somatotropinomas, the disease penetrance was 6%. We observed physical signs of acromegaly in several family members, which were independent of AIP status. Serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels in all family members were above the mean for age and sex (IGF-I SDS: +0.6 [CI95% +0.4-0.9], P < .01). Exome analysis identified two candidate genes: PDE11A, known to be associated with the development of adrenal tumours, and ALG14. Ten asymptomatic p.R304Q family members (age >50 years) were screened for the PDE11A and ALG14 variant; both variants were present in five of ten persons. CONCLUSIONS: This large family adds new information on the p.R304Q AIP variant, and data suggest two new candidate genes could be associated with growth hormone excess.",1
9489855,Involvement of gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission in phencyclidine-induced dopamine release in the medial prefrontal cortex,"The present study was designed to examine the possible involvement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in the mechanism of phencyclidine (1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine; PCP)-induced dopamine release in the medial prefrontal cortex, using in vivo microdialysis in awake, freely moving rats. Local perfusion via the dialysis probe into the medial prefrontal cortex with PCP (100 and 500 microM) and dizocilpine ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydroxy-5-H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclo-heptan-5,10-im ine; MK-801, 10 and 50 microM), a selective non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, was found to increase extracellular dopamine levels. Co-perfusion with NMDA (1 mM) or the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (50 microM) attenuated the effects of PCP (500 microM) and MK-801 (50 microM) on extracellular dopamine levels. The dopamine reuptake inhibitor nomifensine (50 microM) also produced an increase in extracellular dopamine levels in the medial prefrontal cortex, but this effect was not affected by co-perfusion with muscimol (50 microM). On the other hand, local perfusion with PCP (100 and 500 microM) and MK-801 (10 and 50 microM), but not nomifensine (50 microM), reduced extracellular GABA levels in the medial prefrontal cortex. Co-perfusion with NMDA (1 mM) reduced the effects of PCP (500 microM) and MK-801 (50 microM) on extracellular GABA levels. These results suggest that PCP may facilitate dopamine release in the medial prefrontal cortex, at least in part, by the inhibition of GABA release via the antagonism of NMDA receptors.",0
6929767,Properdin factor B(Bf) allele BfF1 specifies an HLA-B18 diabetogenic haplotype,"We found the rare properdin factor B(Bf) variant F1 to be present in 11% of 72 patients suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) compared with 2% among 150 normal controls. BfF1 thus confers a relative risk for IDDM of 5.55. All eight patients and three controls who were BfF1 positive were also HLA-B18 positive, reflecting the strong linkage disequilibrium between these two factors. We suggest that BfF1 marks a 'diabetogenic' B18-bearing HLA haplotype. Studies of unselected families with one or more affected members suggest that the B18, BfF1 does not necessarily segregate with IDDM phenotype. This study provides further evidence for the genetic heterogeneity of IDDM.",1
9927046,Genotype-phenotype correlation in murine Apc mutation: differences in enterocyte migration and response to sulindac,"The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product mediates coordinated cell growth in the intestinal mucosa. In humans, germ-line mutations of APC are associated with colorectal carcinogenesis, a process that varies in severity depending on the length of the protein resulting from the mutant allele. In a previous study of the C57BL/6J-Min/+ (Min/+) mouse, we found that the protein fragment resulting from truncation at codon 850 of murine Apc was associated with changes in enterocyte migration, proliferation, apoptosis, and beta-catenin expression. This effect was reversed upon treatment of Min/+ mice with the chemopreventive drug sulindac sulfide. In this study, we measured enterocyte migration in the Apc1638N mouse, an animal with an Apc mutation that yields no detectable APC protein. We found no difference in enterocyte migration, proliferation, apoptosis, or beta-catenin levels in the Apc1638N mouse when compared to wild-type littermates bearing two normal Apc alleles. Furthermore, administration of sulindac sulfide to Apc1638N mice did not alter enterocyte migration. These observations suggest that a dominant negative effect altering cell migration is exerted by the truncated APC protein present in the Min/+ mouse. These data also suggest that the effectiveness of chemopreventive agents in preventing Apc-related tumor formation may depend on which type of mutation is present.",1
28230850,Metal- and additive-free photoinduced borylation of haloarenes,"Boronic acids and esters have critical roles in the areas of synthetic organic chemistry, molecular sensors, materials science, drug discovery, and catalysis. Many of the current applications of boronic acids and esters require materials with very low levels of transition metal contamination. Most of the current methods for the synthesis of boronic acids, however, require transition metal catalysts and ligands that must be removed via additional purification procedures. This protocol describes a simple, metal- and additive-free method of conversion of haloarenes directly to boronic acids and esters. This photoinduced borylation protocol does not require expensive and toxic metal catalysts or ligands, and it produces innocuous and easy-to-remove by-products. Furthermore, the reaction can be carried out on multigram scales in common-grade solvents without the need for reaction mixtures to be deoxygenated. The setup and purification steps are typically accomplished within 1-3 h. The reactions can be run overnight, and the protocol can be completed within 13-16 h. Two representative procedures that are described in this protocol provide details for preparation of a boronic acid (3-cyanopheylboronic acid) and a boronic ester (1,4-benzenediboronic acid bis(pinacol)ester). We also discuss additional details of the method that will be helpful in the application of the protocol to other haloarene substrates.",0
19617635,Analyses of mental dysfunction-related ACSl4 in Drosophila reveal its requirement for Dpp/BMP production and visual wiring in the brain,"Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs) convert long-chain fatty acids to acyl-CoAs, the activated substrates essential in various metabolic and signaling pathways. Mutations in ACSL4 are associated with non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation (MRX). However, the developmental functions of ACSL4 and how it is involved in the pathogenesis of MRX remain largely unknown. The Drosophila ACSL-like protein is highly homologous to human ACSL3 and ACSL4, and we designate it as dAcsl. In this study, we demonstrate that dAcsl and ACSL4 are highly conserved in terms of ACSL4's ability to substitute the functions of dAcsl in organismal viability, lipid storage and the neural wiring in visual center. In neurodevelopment, decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP-like molecule) production diminished specifically in the larval brain of dAcsl mutants. Consistent with the Dpp reduction, the number of glial cells and neurons dramatically decreased and the retinal axons mis-targeted in the visual cortex. All these defects in Drosophila brain were rescued by the wild-type ACSL4 but not by the mutant products found in MRX patients. Interestingly, expression of an MRX-associated ACSL4 mutant form in a wild-type background led to the lesions in visual center, suggesting a dominant negative effect. These findings validate Drosophila as a model system to reveal the connection between ACSL4 and BMP pathway in neurodevelopment, and to infer the pathogenesis of ACSL4-related MRX.",1
3922972,"Isolation, characterization, and mapping to chromosome 19 of the human apolipoprotein E gene","The human apo-E gene has been isolated from a lambda phage library using as a probe the previously reported apo-E cDNA clone pE-301. Lambda apo-E was mapped and subcloned, and the apo-E gene was completely sequenced. The DNA sequence was compared with that of a near full length cDNA clone pE-368 and revealed three introns. The first intron was in the region that corresponds to the 5' untranslated region of apo-E mRNA. The second intron interrupted the codon specifying amino acid -4 of the apo-E signal peptide. The third intron interrupted the codon specifying amino acid 61 of the mature protein. Analysis of the DNA sequence revealed four Alu sequences. Two were in opposite orientations in the second intron, and one each occurred in the regions 5' and 3' to the apo-E gene. There were two base differences between the apo-E gene sequence and the sequence derived from the cDNA clones. At the codon for amino acid residue 112, the apo-E gene contained CGC, specifying Arg, whereas the cDNA contained TGC, specifying Cys. The other base difference was in the area corresponding to the 5' untranslated region of apo-E mRNA. Apo-E is commonly polymorphic in the population and the data suggest that the genomic clone was derived from the epsilon 4 apo-E allele, whereas the cDNA clones were derived from the epsilon 3 apo-E allele. S1 nuclease protection and primer extension experiments allowed the tentative assignment of the cap site of apo-E mRNA to the A approximately 44 base pairs upstream of the GT that begins the first intron. The sequence TATAATT was identified beginning 33 base pairs upstream of the proposed cap site and is presumably one element of the apo-E promoter. Finally, the apo-E gene was mapped in the human genome to chromosome 19 through the use of DNA probes and human-rodent somatic cell hybrids.",1
16629164,"Homeostatic and toxic mechanisms regulating manganese uptake, retention, and elimination","This review attempts to summarize and clarify our basic knowledge as to the various factors that potentially influence the risks imposed from chronic exposure to high atmospheric levels of manganese (Mn). The studies describe the interrelationship of the different systems in the body that regulate Mn homeostasis by characterizing specific, biological components involved in its systemic and cellular uptake and its elimination from the body. A syndrome known as manganism occurs when individuals are exposed chronically to high levels of Mn, consisting of reduced response speed, intellectual deficits, mood changes, and compulsive behaviors in the initial stages of the disorder to more prominent and irreversible extrapyramidal dysfunction resembling Parkinson's disease upon protracted exposure. Mn intoxication is most often associated with occupations in which abnormally high atmospheric concentrations prevail, such as in welding and mining. There are three potentially important routes by which Mn in inspired air can gain access the body to: 1) direct uptake into the CNS via uptake into the olfactory or trigeminal presynaptic nerve endings located in the nasal mucosa and the subsequent retrograde axonal transport directly into the CNS; 2) transport across the pulmonary epithelial lining and its subsequent deposition into lymph or blood; and/or 3) mucocilliary elevator clearance from the lung and the subsequent ingestion of the metal in the gastrointestinal tract. Each of these processes and their overall contribution to the uptake of Mn in the body is discussed in this review as well as a description of the various mechanisms that have been proposed for the transport of Mn across the bloodbrain barrier which include both a transferrin-dependent and a transferrin-independent process that may involve store-operated Ca channels.",0
9827274,Infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria in children with leukemia,"We reviewed the spectrum of infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in children with leukemia. Three children acquired such infections. One patient developed pneumonia after the cessation of chemotherapy when Mycobacterium xenopi was identified in his lung biopsy specimen. He required 2 years of treatment with antituberculous agents and clarithromycin. Cultures of central and peripheral blood specimens from two patients yielded Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium chelonae, respectively. Broviac catheters were likely the source of infection. Removal of the catheters and antibiotic treatment resulted in cure. Central venous catheters in leukemic children are potential sources of infection. For febrile neutropenic children with leukemia who do not respond to antibiotic therapy, cultures positive for diphtheroids or negative routine bacterial and fungal cultures should raise a suspicion for infections due to NTM. Systemic infections may require up to 2 years of therapy. Removal of the infected catheters during persistent or recurrent infections in necessary for control of the infection.",0
18761119,Rapid and selective detection of cysteine based on its induced aggregates of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide capped gold nanoparticles,"A detection method of cysteine is reported in this contribution with water-soluble positively charged gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) that were prepared by seed-mediated method and capped with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). In aqueous medium of pH 4.2, the CTAB-capped Au-NPs display greatly different features from those of generally prepared citrate-coated Au-NPs. It was found that in a medium of high salt concentration, the presence of cysteine could induce aggregation of CTAB-capped Au-NPs, while citrate-coated Au-NPs could get aggregation soon even if without the presence of cysteine. The cysteine-induced aggregates of CTAB-capped Au-NPs display strong plasmon resonance light scattering (PRLS) signals characterized at 566.0nm when excited by a light beam, and the PRLS intensities of the aggregates are in proportion to the concentration of cysteine in the range of 0.01-0.40microgmL(-1) with the limit of detection (3sigma) being 2.9ngmL(-1). No amino acids in the samples interfere with the detection, and cysteine in artificial samples could be detected with the recovery between 95.3% and 105.9%, and R.S.D. is less than 3.6%.",0
29580652,"Gambling behavior in Parkinson's Disease: Impulsivity, reward mechanism and cortical brain oscillations","Psychopathological components, such as reward sensitivity and impulsivity, and dopaminergic treatment are crucial characteristics related to the development of Pathological Gambling (PG) in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The aim of the present study is to investigate the differences in decision-making in PD patients with or without PG considering both neurophysiological and behavioral aspects. The IOWA Gambling Task (IGT) and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity were considered to elucidate the decision and post-feedback processes in PG. The sample included fifty-two PD patients, divided in three groups: 17 PD patients with active gambling behavior (PD Gamblers, PDG); 15 PD patients who remitted from PG (PD Non-Gamblers, PDNG); and a Control Group (CG) composed by 20 patients with PD only. EEG and IGT performance were recorded during decision and post-feedback phase. Results showed worse performance and an increase of the low frequency bands in the frontal area for the PDG group compared to the other two groups. In addition, higher BAS (Behavioral Activation System) and BIS-11 (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale) personality components were correlated to groups' behavioral response. These results show an anomalous behavioral (IGT) and cortical response of PDG patients related to their inability to use adequate control mechanisms during a decision-making task where reward mechanisms (BAS) and impulsivity (BIS-11) are relevant.",0

7689250,A receptor for the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax: the erythrocyte chemokine receptor,"Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum are the major causes of human malaria, except in sub-Saharan Africa where people lack the Duffy blood group antigen, the erythrocyte receptor for P. vivax. Duffy negative human erythrocytes are resistant to invasion by P. vivax and the related monkey malaria, P. knowlesi. Several lines of evidence in the present study indicate that the Duffy blood group antigen is the erythrocyte receptor for the chemokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and melanoma growth stimulatory activity (MGSA). First, IL-8 binds minimally to Duffy negative erythrocytes. Second, a monoclonal antibody to the Duffy blood group antigen blocked binding of IL-8 and other chemokines to Duffy positive erythrocytes. Third, both MGSA and IL-8 blocked the binding of the parasite ligand and the invasion of human erythrocytes by P. knowlesi, suggesting the possibility of receptor blockade for anti-malarial therapy.",1

12110844,Association of the ADAM33 gene with asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness,"Asthma is a common respiratory disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of coughing, wheezing and breathlessness. Although environmental factors such as allergen exposure are risk factors in the development of asthma, both twin and family studies point to a strong genetic component. To date, linkage studies have identified more than a dozen genomic regions linked to asthma. In this study, we performed a genome-wide scan on 460 Caucasian families and identified a locus on chromosome 20p13 that was linked to asthma (log(10) of the likelihood ratio (LOD), 2.94) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (LOD, 3.93). A survey of 135 polymorphisms in 23 genes identified the ADAM33 gene as being significantly associated with asthma using case-control, transmission disequilibrium and haplotype analyses (P = 0.04 0.000003). ADAM proteins are membrane-anchored metalloproteases with diverse functions, which include the shedding of cell-surface proteins such as cytokines and cytokine receptors. The identification and characterization of ADAM33, a putative asthma susceptibility gene identified by positional cloning in an outbred population, should provide insights into the pathogenesis and natural history of this common disease.",1

27066583,Dysfunctional ADAM22 implicated in progressive encephalopathy with cortical atrophy and epilepsy,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the molecular genetic basis of a syndrome characterized by rapidly progressing cerebral atrophy, intractable seizures, and intellectual disability. METHODS: We performed exome sequencing in the proband and whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping (copy number variant analysis) in the proband-parent trio. We used heterologous expression systems to study the functional consequences of identified mutations. RESULTS: The search for potentially deleterious recessive or de novo variants yielded compound heterozygous missense (c.1202G>A, p.Cys401Tyr) and frameshift deletion (c.2396delG, p.Ser799IlefsTer96) mutations in ADAM22, which encodes a postsynaptic receptor for LGI1. The deleterious effect of the mutations was observed in cell surface binding and immunoprecipitation assays, which revealed that both mutant proteins failed to bind to LGI1. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation assays showed that the frameshift mutant ADAM22 also did not bind to the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95. CONCLUSIONS: The mutations identified abolish the LGI1-ADAM22 ligand-receptor complex and are thus a likely primary cause of the proband's epilepsy syndrome, which is characterized by unusually rapidly progressing cortical atrophy starting at 3-4 months of age. These findings are in line with the implicated role of the LGI1-ADAM22 complex as a key player in nervous system development, specifically in functional maturation of postnatal synapses. Because the frameshift mutation affects an alternatively spliced exon with highest expression in postnatal brain, the combined effect of the mutations is likely to be hypomorphic rather than complete loss of function. This is compatible with the longer survival of the patient compared to Lgi1 (-/-) and Adam22 (-/-) mice, which develop lethal seizures during the first postnatal weeks.",1
2466575,A lymphocyte molecule implicated in lymph node homing is a member of the cartilage link protein family,"Monoclonal antibodies in the Hermes family recognize a lymphocyte structure that participates in lymphocyte adhesion to endothelium and has been suggested to be the human homolog of the murine Mel-14 lymph node homing receptor. Recently, antibodies against the Hermes antigen, the polymorphic glycoprotein Pgp-1 antigen, and the broadly expressed CDw44 antigen have been shown to recognize the same structure. In this work, cDNA clones encoding the CDw44 antigen were isolated and expressed in COS cells. Two forms were identified: a lymphoid form expressed in hematopoietic cells, and an epithelial form weakly expressed in normal epithelium but highly expressed in carcinomas. The extracellular domain of CDw44 bears homology to cartilage link proteins and a related segment of proteoglycan core protein. However, comparison with the recently identified sequence of the Mel-14 antigen shows that CDw44 and Mel-14 are unrelated.",1
8843194,"Targeted disruption of ATM leads to growth retardation, chromosomal fragmentation during meiosis, immune defects, and thymic lymphoma","ATM, the gene mutated in the inherited human disease ataxia-telangiectasia, is a member of a family of kinases involved in DNA metabolism and cell-cycle checkpoint control. To help clarify the physiological roles of the ATM protein, we disrupted the ATM gene in mice through homologous recombination. Initial evaluation of the ATM knockout animals indicates that inactivation of the mouse ATM gene recreates much of the phenotype of ataxia-telangiectasia. The homozygous mutant (ATM-/-) mice are viable, growth-retarded, and infertile. The infertility of ATM-/- mice results from meiotic failure. Meiosis is arrested at the zygotene/pachytene stage of prophase I as a result of abnormal chromosomal synapsis and subsequent chromosome fragmentation. Immune defects also are evident in ATM-/- mice, including reduced numbers of B220+CD43- pre-B cells, thymocytes, and peripheral T cells, as well as functional impairment of T-cell-dependent immune responses. The cerebella of ATM-/- mice appear normal by histologic examination at 3 to 4 months and the mice have no gross behavioral abnormalities. The majority of mutant mice rapidly develop thymic lymphomas and die before 4 months of age. These findings indicate that the ATM gene product plays an essential role in a diverse group of cellular processes, including meiosis, the normal growth of somatic tissues, immune development, and tumor suppression.",1
13130483,Mutations in the amino terminus of ANKH in two US families with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze ANKH in families with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease (CPPD) for disease-causing mutations. METHODS: Two US families (one of British ancestry and the other of German/Swiss ancestry) with autosomal-dominant CPPD, whose disease phenotypes were found to be linked to chromosome 5p15.1 (locus symbol CCAL2), were screened by direct sequencing for mutations in ANKH, a gene in the CCAL2 candidate interval that has been shown to harbor mutations in other families with CPPD. Observed sequence variants were confirmed by antisense sequencing, and expression of the mutant allele was verified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of messenger RNA followed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: The two US families displayed the same mutation at position 5 of the ANKH gene product (P5T). All affected members were heterozygous for the P-to-T variant, and the mutation was not seen in 204 control alleles. The two families displayed distinct disease haplotypes, suggesting that they were unrelated to each other. CONCLUSION: These observations represent the fourth and fifth families with heritable CPPD whose disease phenotypes are linked to the CCAL2 locus and who have missense mutations in the amino terminus of ANKH. This same position (P5) was the site of a missense mutation in an Argentine family of northern Italian ancestry; however, the sequence variant in that family generated a P5L mutation. The distinct disease haplotypes among the 3 families with P5 mutations suggest that the mutations arose independently and that the evolutionarily conserved P5 position of ANKH may represent a hot spot for mutation in families with autosomal-dominant CPPD.",1

23359570,"Missense mutations in beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (B3GNT1) cause Walker-Warburg syndrome","Several known or putative glycosyltransferases are required for the synthesis of laminin-binding glycans on alpha-dystroglycan (alphaDG), including POMT1, POMT2, POMGnT1, LARGE, Fukutin, FKRP, ISPD and GTDC2. Mutations in these glycosyltransferase genes result in defective alphaDG glycosylation and reduced ligand binding by alphaDG causing a clinically heterogeneous group of congenital muscular dystrophies, commonly referred to as dystroglycanopathies. The most severe clinical form, Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), is characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy and severe neurological and ophthalmological defects. Here, we report two homozygous missense mutations in the beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (B3GNT1) gene in a family affected with WWS. Functional studies confirmed the pathogenicity of the mutations. First, expression of wild-type but not mutant B3GNT1 in human prostate cancer (PC3) cells led to increased levels of alphaDG glycosylation. Second, morpholino knockdown of the zebrafish b3gnt1 orthologue caused characteristic muscular defects and reduced alphaDG glycosylation. These functional studies identify an important role of B3GNT1 in the synthesis of the uncharacterized laminin-binding glycan of alphaDG and implicate B3GNT1 as a novel causative gene for WWS.",1
12621437,Apolipoprotein L-I is the trypanosome lytic factor of human serum,"Human sleeping sickness in east Africa is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The basis of this pathology is the resistance of these parasites to lysis by normal human serum (NHS). Resistance to NHS is conferred by a gene that encodes a truncated form of the variant surface glycoprotein termed serum resistance associated protein (SRA). We show that SRA is a lysosomal protein, and that the amino-terminal alpha-helix of SRA is responsible for resistance to NHS. This domain interacts strongly with a carboxy-terminal alpha-helix of the human-specific serum protein apolipoprotein L-I (apoL-I). Depleting NHS of apoL-I, by incubation with SRA or anti-apoL-I, led to the complete loss of trypanolytic activity. Addition of native or recombinant apoL-I either to apoL-I-depleted NHS or to fetal calf serum induced lysis of NHS-sensitive, but not NHS-resistant, trypanosomes. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that apoL-I is taken up through the endocytic pathway into the lysosome. We propose that apoL-I is the trypanosome lytic factor of NHS, and that SRA confers resistance to lysis by interaction with apoL-I in the lysosome.",1
30209245,A database of tissue-specific rhythmically expressed human genes has potential applications in circadian medicine,"The discovery that half of the mammalian protein-coding genome is regulated by the circadian clock has clear implications for medicine. Recent studies demonstrated that the circadian clock influences therapeutic outcomes in human heart disease and cancer. However, biological time is rarely given clinical consideration. A key barrier is the absence of information on tissue-specific molecular rhythms in the human body. We have applied the cyclic ordering by periodic structure (CYCLOPS) algorithm, designed to reconstruct sample temporal order in the absence of time-of-day information, to the gene expression collection of 13 tissues from 632 human donors. We identified rhythms in gene expression across the body; nearly half of protein-coding genes were shown to be cycling in at least 1 of the 13 tissues analyzed. One thousand of these cycling genes encode proteins that either transport or metabolize drugs or are themselves drug targets. These results provide a useful resource for studying the role of circadian rhythms in medicine and support the idea that biological time might play a role in determining drug response.",0
19532138,Identification of protein cofactors necessary for sequence-specific plasmid DNA nuclear import,"Although transfections are routinely used in the laboratory, the mechanism(s) by which exogenous DNA is transported into the nucleus is poorly understood. By improving our understanding of how vectors circumvent the numerous cellular barriers to gene transfer, more efficient gene delivery methods can be devised. We have begun to design plasmid constructs that enter the nucleus of specific cell types in the absence of cell division, thereby enhancing levels of expression. We have shown that inclusion of specific DNA sequences in plasmid constructs mediates nuclear import both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we use plasmid affinity chromatography, mass spectrometry (MS), and live-cell pulldowns of transfected plasmid constructs to identify protein cofactors that interact in a sequence-specific manner with these DNA nuclear targeting sequences (DTSs). Importin beta(1), importin 7, and the small guanosine triphosphatase Ran all demonstrate DTS-specific interaction in both MS and pull-down assays, consistent with our model of plasmid nuclear import. In addition, knockdown of importin beta(1) with small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogates plasmid nuclear import, indicating that it is a necessary cofactor. Our discovery that specific karyopherins mediate plasmid nuclear import can be used to design more effective vectors for gene delivery.",0

30332578,"Periodic, Parasite-Mediated Selection For and Against Sex","Asexual lineages should rapidly replace sexual populations. Why sex then? The Red Queen hypothesis proposes that parasite-mediated selection against common host genotypes could counteract the per capita birth rate advantage of asexuals. Under the Red Queen hypothesis, fluctuations in parasite-mediated selection can drive fluctuations in the asexual population, leading to the coexistence of sexual and asexual reproduction. Does shifting selection by parasites drive fluctuations in the fitness and frequency of asexuals in nature? Combining long-term field data with mesocosm experiments, we detected a shift in the direction of parasite selection in the snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum and its coevolving parasite, Microphallus sp. In the early 2000s, asexuals were more infected than sexuals. A decade later, the asexuals had declined in frequency and were less infected than sexuals. Over time, the mean infection prevalence of asexuals equaled that of sexuals but varied far more. This variation in asexual infection prevalence suggests the potential for parasite-mediated fluctuations in asexual fitness. Accordingly, we detected fitness consequences of the shift in parasite selection: when they were less infected than sexuals, asexuals increased in frequency in the field and in paired mesocosms that isolated the effect of parasites. The match between field and experiment argues that coevolving parasites drive temporal change in the relative fitness and frequency of asexuals, potentially promoting the coexistence of reproductive modes in P. antipodarum.",0
24791904,AP1S3 mutations are associated with pustular psoriasis and impaired Toll-like receptor 3 trafficking,"Adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) is an evolutionary conserved heterotetramer that promotes vesicular trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and the endosomes. The knockout of most murine AP-1 complex subunits is embryonically lethal, so the identification of human disease-associated alleles has the unique potential to deliver insights into gene function. Here, we report two founder mutations (c.11T>G [p.Phe4Cys] and c.97C>T [p.Arg33Trp]) in AP1S3, the gene encoding AP-1 complex subunit sigma1C, in 15 unrelated individuals with a severe autoinflammatory skin disorder known as pustular psoriasis. Because the variants are predicted to destabilize the 3D structure of the AP-1 complex, we generated AP1S3-knockdown cell lines to investigate the consequences of AP-1 deficiency in skin keratinocytes. We found that AP1S3 silencing disrupted the endosomal translocation of the innate pattern-recognition receptor TLR-3 (Toll-like receptor 3) and resulted in a marked inhibition of downstream signaling. These findings identify pustular psoriasis as an autoinflammatory phenotype caused by defects in vesicular trafficking and demonstrate a requirement of AP-1 for Toll-like receptor homeostasis. ",1

They pose a clinical challenge with significant economic implications. One proposed solution is implant irrigation at the time of placement. There is no consensus on the optimal irrigant solution. METHODS: We tested the relative efficacy of betadine (10% povidone-iodine), clorpactin, prontosan(R), triple antibiotic solution (TAB), or normal saline (negative control) against two strains each of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Sterile, smooth silicone implant discs were immersed in irrigant solution, then incubated in suspensions of MRSA or S. epidermidis overnight. The discs were rinsed, then sonicated to displace adherent bacteria from the implant surface and the displaced bacteria quantified. Normalised values were calculated to characterise the relative efficacy of each irrigant. RESULTS: Betadine resulted in reductions of the bacterial load by a factor of 10-10 for all strains. Prontosan(R)-treated smooth breast implant discs had a 10-fold reduction in bacterial counts for all but one MRSA strain. In comparison to prontosan(R), TAB demonstrated a trend of greater reduction in MRSA bacterial load and weaker activity against S. epidermidis strains. Clorpactin reduced the recovered CFUs for only a single strain of S. epidermidis. Betadine demonstrated the greatest efficacy against all four strains. However, clorpactin, TAB, and prontosan(R) demonstrated similar efficacies. CONCLUSION: Betadine was the most efficacious of the irrigants at reducing MRSA and S. epidermidis contamination. Given the recent lifting of the FDA moratorium, larger clinical studies of betadine as a breast implant irrigant solution are warranted.",0

Haemocytes from both controls and exposed cockles were collected, and the effects of NP on total haemocyte count (THC) and volume of circulating cells, intracellular superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) levels, acid phosphatase and lysozyme-like activities in both haemocyte lysate (HL) and cell-free haemolymph (CFH) were evaluated. Exposure of cockles to 0.1mg/l NP significantly increased THC (p<0.05) with respect to controls. Analysis of haemocyte size frequency distribution showed that the haemocyte fraction of about 7-8 microm in diameter and 250 femtolitres in volume increased markedly in cockles exposed to the highest NP concentration tested. Apoptosis resulting in cell volume reduction in NP-exposed animals cannot be excluded. No statistically significant variation in intracellular O(2)(-) levels was observed. Conversely, significant increases (p<0.05) in acid phosphatase activity were observed in CFH from 0.05 and 0.1mg/l NP-exposed animals; no significant differences in enzyme activity were recorded in HL. Lysozyme-like activity also increased significantly in CFH from cockles exposed to 0.05 mg/l NP (p<0.05) and 0.1 mg/l NP (p<0.001). Instead, lysozyme-like activity decreased significantly (p<0.05) in the HL of animals exposed to 0.05 mg/lNP. Our results suggest that NP induces variations in the functional responses of haemocytes of C. glaucum, mainly by reducing cell membrane stability and promoting cell degranulation.",0

Characteristic pulmonary arterial changes including plexiform lesions with varying developmental stages were widely observed throughout the lungs. Complication of these two distinct disease processes seems to be rarely encountered in the literature.

Based on that research, this study proposes a hierarchical prediction approach to forecast future industrial water demand. Three water demand scenarios (high, medium, and low) were then established based on potential future industrial structural adjustments, and used to predict water demand for the structural hierarchy. The predictive results of this approach were compared with results from a grey prediction model (GPM (1, 1)). The comparison shows that the results of the two approaches were basically identical, differing by less than 10%. Taking Tianjin, China, as a case, and using data from 2003-2012, this study predicts that industrial water demand will continuously increase, reaching 580 million m(3), 776.4 million m(3), and approximately 1.09 billion m(3) by the years 2015, 2020 and 2025 respectively. It is concluded that Tianjin will soon face another water crisis if no immediate measures are taken. This study recommends that Tianjin adjust its industrial structure with water savings as the main objective, and actively seek new sources of water to increase its supply.",0
30701273,"ACTN2 mutations cause """"Multiple structured Core Disease"""" (MsCD)","The identification of genes implicated in myopathies is essential for diagnosis and for revealing novel therapeutic targets. Here we characterize a novel subclass of congenital myopathy at the morphological, molecular, and functional level. Through exome sequencing, we identified de novo ACTN2 mutations, a missense and a deletion, in two unrelated patients presenting with progressive early-onset muscle weakness and respiratory involvement. Morphological and ultrastructural analyses of muscle biopsies revealed a distinctive pattern with the presence of muscle fibers containing small structured cores and jagged Z-lines. Deeper analysis of the missense mutation revealed mutant alpha-actinin-2 properly localized to the Z-line in differentiating myotubes and its level was not altered in muscle biopsy. Modelling of the disease in zebrafish and mice by exogenous expression of mutated alpha-actinin-2 recapitulated the abnormal muscle function and structure seen in the patients. Motor deficits were noted in zebrafish, and muscle force was impaired in isolated muscles from AAV-transduced mice. In both models, sarcomeric disorganization was evident, while expression of wild-type alpha-actinin-2 did not result in muscle anomalies. The murine muscles injected with mutant ACTN2 displayed cores and Z-line defects. Dominant ACTN2 mutations were previously associated with cardiomyopathies, and our data demonstrate that specific mutations in the well-known Z-line regulator alpha-actinin-2 can cause a skeletal muscle disorder.",1
25315773,Phospholipid flippase activities and substrate specificities of human type IV P-type ATPases localized to the plasma membrane,"Type IV P-type ATPases (P4-ATPases) are believed to translocate aminophospholipids from the exoplasmic to the cytoplasmic leaflets of cellular membranes. The yeast P4-ATPases, Drs2p and Dnf1p/Dnf2p, flip nitrobenzoxadiazole-labeled phosphatidylserine at the Golgi complex and nitrobenzoxadiazole-labeled phosphatidylcholine (PC) at the plasma membrane, respectively. However, the flippase activities and substrate specificities of mammalian P4-ATPases remain incompletely characterized. In this study, we established an assay for phospholipid flippase activities of plasma membrane-localized P4-ATPases using human cell lines stably expressing ATP8B1, ATP8B2, ATP11A, and ATP11C. We found that ATP11A and ATP11C have flippase activities toward phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine but not PC or sphingomyelin. By contrast, ATPase-deficient mutants of ATP11A and ATP11C did not exhibit any flippase activity, indicating that these enzymes catalyze flipping in an ATPase-dependent manner. Furthermore, ATP8B1 and ATP8B2 exhibited preferential flippase activities toward PC. Some ATP8B1 mutants found in patients of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1), a severe liver disease caused by impaired bile flow, failed to translocate PC despite their delivery to the plasma membrane. Moreover, incorporation of PC mediated by ATP8B1 can be reversed by simultaneous expression of ABCB4, a PC floppase mutated in PFIC3 patients. Our findings elucidate the flippase activities and substrate specificities of plasma membrane-localized human P4-ATPases and suggest that phenotypes of some PFIC1 patients result from impairment of the PC flippase activity of ATP8B1.

12804581,The contribution of the SPCA1 Ca2+ pump to the Ca2+ accumulation in the Golgi apparatus of HeLa cells assessed via RNA-mediated interference,"The secretory-pathway Ca(2+)-ATPase SPCA1 is a thapsigargin-insensitive intracellular Ca(2+) pump found mostly in the Golgi compartment. We have explored the contribution of this Ca(2+) pump to cytosolic Ca(2+) signaling in HeLa cells by using RNA-mediated interference to disrupt its expression. Removal of SPCA1 was confirmed by immunofluorescence with specific anti-SPCA1 antibodies. Measurements of the free Ca(2+) concentration in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus by specifically targeting the Ca(2+)-sensitive luminescent protein aequorin to this organelle revealed that endogenous SPCA1 was responsible for Ca(2+) uptake in a subfraction of the Golgi apparatus. HeLa cells lacking SPCA1 could still set up baseline Ca(2+) spiking when stimulated with histamine, indicating that the SPCA1-containing Ca(2+) store was not absolutely needed to set up these oscillations. However, baseline Ca(2+) oscillations occurred less frequently than in control cells, pointing to a contribution of SPCA1 in the shaping of the cytosolic Ca(2+) signal in HeLa cells.",1
14534590,The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway regulates cardiac valve formation,"Truncation of the tumour suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) constitutively activates the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway. Apc has a role in development: for example, embryos of mice with truncated Apc do not complete gastrulation. To understand this role more fully, we examined the effect of truncated Apc on zebrafish development. Here we show that, in contrast to mice, zebrafish do complete gastrulation. However, mutant hearts fail to loop and form excessive endocardial cushions. Conversely, overexpression of Apc or Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1), a secreted Wnt inhibitor, blocks cushion formation. In wild-type hearts, nuclear beta-catenin, the hallmark of activated canonical Wnt signalling, accumulates only in valve-forming cells, where it can activate a Tcf reporter. In mutant hearts, all cells display nuclear beta-catenin and Tcf reporter activity, while valve markers are markedly upregulated. Concomitantly, proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, normally restricted to endocardial cushions, occur throughout the endocardium. Our findings identify a novel role for Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in determining endocardial cell fate.",1
2894031,Exon-intron organization and sequence comparison of human and murine T11 (CD2) genes,"Genomic DNA clones containing the human and murine genes coding for the 50-kDa T11 (CD2) T-cell surface glycoprotein were characterized. The human T11 gene is approximately equal to 12 kilobases long and comprised of five exons. A leader exon (L) contains the 5'-untranslated region and most of the nucleotides defining the signal peptide [amino acids (aa) -24 to -5]. Two exons encode the extracellular segment; exon Ex1 is 321 base pairs (bp) long and codes for four residues of the leader peptide and aa 1-103 of the mature protein, and exon Ex2 is 231 bp long and encodes aa 104-180. Exon TM is 123 bp long and codes for the single transmembrane region of the molecule (aa 181-221). Exon C is a large 765-bp exon encoding virtually the entire cytoplasmic domain (aa 222-327) and the 3'-untranslated region. The murine T11 gene has a similar organization with exon-intron boundaries essentially identical to the human gene. Substantial conservation of nucleotide sequences between species in both 5'- and 3'-gene flanking regions equivalent to that among homologous exons suggests that murine and human genes may be regulated in a similar fashion. The probable relationship of the individual T11 exons to functional and structural protein domains is discussed.",1

A feline model for MPS VI was used to evaluate tissue distribution and clinical efficacy of three forms of recombinant human N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (rh4S, EC 3.1.6.1). Intravenously administered rh4S was rapidly cleared from circulation. The majority of rh4S was distributed to liver, but was also detected in most other tissues. Tissue half-life was approximately 2-4 d. Three MPS VI cats given regular intravenous infusions of rh4S for up to 20 mo showed variable reduction of storage vacuoles in Kupffer cells and connective tissues, however cartilage chondrocytes remained vacuolated. Vertebral bone mineral volume was improved in two MPS VI cats in which therapy was initiated before skeletal maturity, and increased bone volume appeared to correlate with earlier age of onset of therapy.

We and others have previously shown that mutations in the tissue-restricted a4 and B1 subunits of the H(+)-ATPase underlie this syndrome. Here, we describe an Atp6v0a4 knockout mouse, which lacks the a4 subunit. Using beta-galactosidase as a reporter for the null gene, developmental a4 expression was detected in developing bone, nose, eye, and skin, in addition to that expected in kidney and inner ear. By the time of weaning, Atp6v0a4(-/-) mice demonstrated severe metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and early nephrocalcinosis. Null mice were hypocitraturic, but hypercalciuria was absent. They were severely hearing-impaired, as shown by elevated auditory brainstem response thresholds and absent endocochlear potential. They died rapidly unless alkalinized. If they survived weaning with alkali supplementation, treatment could later be withdrawn, but -/- animals remained acidotic with alkaline urine. They also had an impaired sense of smell. Heterozygous animals were biochemically normal until acid-challenged, when they became more acidotic than +/+ animals. This mouse model recapitulates the loss of H(+)-ATPase function seen in human disease and can provide additional insights into dRTA and the physiology of the a4 subunit.",1

The optoelectrical characteristics of the MISIM heterostructures are investigated at lower and higher biases and are explained by a band model based on two asymmetric back-to-back Schottky barriers. The forward current of the heterojunctions is due to majority-carrier injection over the lower barrier, while the reverse current exhibits two different conduction regimes corresponding to the diffusion of thermal/photo generated carriers and majority-carrier tunneling through the higher Schottky barrier. The two conduction regimes in reverse bias generate two plateaus, over which the photocurrent increases linearly with the light intensity that endows the detector with bias-controlled photocurrent.",0
25717356,Cardiac and non-cardiac causes of T-wave inversion in the precordial leads in adult subjects: A Dutch case series and review of the literature,"AIM: To describe the electrocardiographic (ECG) phenomena characterized by T-wave inversion in the precordial leads in adults and to highlight its differential diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 8 adult patients who were admitted with ECG T-wave inversion in the anterior chest leads with or without prolongation of corrected QT (QTc) interval. They had different clinical conditions. Each patient underwent appropriate clinical assessment including investigation for myocardial involvement. Single and multimodality non-invasive, semi-invasive and invasive diagnostic approach were used to ascertain the diagnosis. The diagnostic assessment included biochemical investigation, cardiac and abdominal ultrasound, cerebral and chest computed tomography, nuclear medicine and coronary angiography. RESULTS: Eight adult subjects (5 females) with a mean age of 66 years (range 51 to 82) are analyzed. The etiology of T-wave inversion in the precordial leads were diverse. On admission, all patients had normal blood pressure and the ECG showed sinus rhythm. Five patients showed marked prolongation of the QTc interval. The longest QTc interval (639 ms) was found in the patient with pheochromocytoma. Giant T-wave inversion (>/= 10 mm) was found in pheochromocytoma followed by electroconvulsive therapy and finally ischemic heart disease. The deepest T-wave was measured in lead V3 (5 x). In 3 patients presented with mild T-wave inversion (patients 1, 5 and 4 mm), the QTc interval was not prolonged (432, 409 and 424 msec), respectively. CONCLUSION: T-wave inversion associated with or without QTc prolongation requires meticulous history taking, physical examination and tailored diagnostic modalities to reach rapid and correct diagnosis to establish appropriate therapeutic intervention.",0
2791751,Carbohydrate recognition in neuronal development: structure and expression of surface oligosaccharides and beta-galactoside-binding lectins,"The differentiation and development of vertebrate neurons is controlled in part by interactions with cell surface and extracellular matrix molecules, many of which are glycoproteins that mediate their developmental actions by homophilic or heterophilic binding to other glycoproteins. In addition there is increasing evidence that cell recognition and adhesion in some embryonic cell types involve interactions between cell surface oligosaccharides and complementary carbohydrate-binding proteins. Although a role for carbohydrate recognition in neuronal development has been proposed, the precise function of complex carbohydrate structures on neural cells has not been defined. To approach this problem, we have examined the structure and expression of cell surface oligosaccharides and carbohydrate-binding proteins by primary sensory neurons in the rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG). There are several functionally distinct subsets of DRG neurons, each of which conveys a different sensory modality to distinct target domains in the spinal cord. Monoclonal antibodies against defined oligosaccharide structures identify each of the major subsets of DRG neurons on the basis of their expression of a distinct set of complex oligosaccharides, derived from lacto-, globo- and ganglioseries backbone structures. In particular, small diameter DRG neurons involved in pain processing express beta-galactoside-based lactoseries oligosaccharides. DRG and spinal cord neurons also express two soluble beta-galactoside-binding proteins of relative molecular masses 14,500 and 29,000, termed RL-14.5 and RL-29, which represent potential ligands for lactoseries oligosaccharides. RL-14.5 is expressed by the majority of DRG neurons whereas RL-29 is restricted to the subset of small DRG neurons that express surface N-acetyllactosamine structures. RL-14.5 and RL-29 are expressed soon after the differentiation of DRG neurons and appear to be released from cultured DRG neurons. Rat brain cDNA clones encoding RL-14.5 have been isolated. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of RL-14.5 has confirmed that this lectin is highly homologous to soluble beta-galactoside-binding proteins in other vertebrate species. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization indicate that RL-14.5 mRNA is selectively expressed in sensory and motor neurons in the rat nervous system. The selective expression of lactoseries oligosaccharides and complementary beta-galactoside-binding lectins may contribute to the differentiation and/or development of these two classes of neurons.",0
19786693,"Apolipoprotein genotype does not influence MS severity, cognition, or brain atrophy","BACKGROUND: The influence of APOE allelic heterogeneity on multiple sclerosis (MS) disease severity has been reported in multiple datasets with conflicting results. Several studies have reported an unfavorable association of APOE epsilon4 with more severe clinical disease course while, in contrast, APOE epsilon2 has been associated with a more benign disease course. In this study, we examine the influence of heterogeneity of the APOE gene on disease severity in a large, Australian, population-based MS cohort. METHODS: Associations between APOE allele status, 2 promoter region single nucleotide polymorphisms (-219 G/T and +113 C/G), and 4 measures of disease severity were tested in 1,006 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS: 1) Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score; 2) Progression Index (Expanded Disability Status Scale/disease duration); 3) age at first symptom; and 4) interval between the first and second attack. The Symbol Digit Modalities Test was used as a single cognitive marker in 889 patients. Brain atrophy was measured in 792 patients using the intercaudate ratio. APOE epsilon4 and epsilon3 carriers were stratified by -219 G/T or +113 C/G to investigate haplotypic heterogeneity in the APOE gene region. RESULTS: In this MS study, neither APOE allele status nor promoter region heterogeneity at positions -219 G/T or +113 C/G influenced the clinical disease severity, cognition, or cerebral atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Allelic and haplotypic heterogeneity of the APOE gene region does not influence multiple sclerosis disease course in this well-defined Australian multiple sclerosis cohort.",1
10646608,Negative regulation of lymphocyte activation and autoimmunity by the molecular adaptor Cbl-b,"The signalling thresholds of antigen receptors and co-stimulatory receptors determine immunity or tolerance to self molecules. Changes in co-stimulatory pathways can lead to enhanced activation of lymphocytes and autoimmunity, or the induction of clonal anergy. The molecular mechanisms that maintain immunotolerance in vivo and integrate co-stimulatory signals with antigen receptor signals in T and B lymphocytes are poorly understood. Members of the Cbl/Sli family of molecular adaptors function downstream from growth factor and antigen receptors. Here we show that gene-targeted mice lacking the adaptor Cbl-b develop spontaneous autoimmunity characterized by auto-antibody production, infiltration of activated T and B lymphocytes into multiple organs, and parenchymal damage. Resting cbl-b(-/-) lymphocytes hyperproliferate upon antigen receptor stimulation, and cbl-b(-/-) T cells display specific hyperproduction of the T-cell growth factor interleukin-2, but not interferon-gamma or tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Mutation of Cbl-b uncouples T-cell proliferation, interleukin-2 production and phosphorylation of the GDP/GTP exchange factor Vav1 from the requirement for CD28 co-stimulation. Cbl-b is thus a key regulator of activation thresholds in mature lymphocytes and immunological tolerance and autoimmunity.",1

25671503,A neurocomputational model of automatic sequence production,"Most behaviors unfold in time and include a sequence of submovements or cognitive activities. In addition, most behaviors are automatic and repeated daily throughout life. Yet, relatively little is known about the neurobiology of automatic sequence production. Past research suggests a gradual transfer from the associative striatum to the sensorimotor striatum, but a number of more recent studies challenge this role of the BG in automatic sequence production. In this article, we propose a new neurocomputational model of automatic sequence production in which the main role of the BG is to train cortical-cortical connections within the premotor areas that are responsible for automatic sequence production. The new model is used to simulate four different data sets from human and nonhuman animals, including (1) behavioral data (e.g., RTs), (2) electrophysiology data (e.g., single-neuron recordings), (3) macrostructure data (e.g., TMS), and (4) neurological circuit data (e.g., inactivation studies). We conclude with a comparison of the new model with existing models of automatic sequence production and discuss a possible new role for the BG in automaticity and its implication for Parkinson's disease.",0

DESIGN: Retrospective case-control association study. METHODS: Patients with POAG (n = 242) and controls (n = 187) were analyzed for the APOE epsilon 2/epsilon 3/epsilon 4 polymorphisms using minisequencing technique. RESULTS: The Alzheimer-associated APOE epsilon 4 allele had similar frequencies in the POAG group and in the control group. There was no difference between cases and controls with regard to APOE genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: If a common pathogenic mechanism exists for the two age-related neurodegenerative diseases, POAG and AD, it does not involve APOE polymorphisms.",1
21412338,The CatSper channel mediates progesterone-induced Ca2+ influx in human sperm,"In the oviduct, cumulus cells that surround the oocyte release progesterone. In human sperm, progesterone stimulates a Ca(2+) increase by a non-genomic mechanism. The Ca(2+) signal has been proposed to control chemotaxis, hyperactivation and acrosomal exocytosis of sperm. However, the underlying signalling mechanism has remained mysterious. Here we show that progesterone activates the sperm-specific, pH-sensitive CatSper Ca(2+) channel. We found that both progesterone and alkaline pH stimulate a rapid Ca(2+) influx with almost no latency, incompatible with a signalling pathway involving metabotropic receptors and second messengers. The Ca(2+) signals evoked by alkaline pH and progesterone are inhibited by the Ca(v) channel blockers NNC 55-0396 and mibefradil. Patch-clamp recordings from sperm reveal an alkaline-activated current carried by mono- and divalent ions that exhibits all the hallmarks of sperm-specific CatSper Ca(2+) channels. Progesterone substantially enhances the CatSper current. The alkaline- and progesterone-activated CatSper current is inhibited by both drugs. Our results resolve a long-standing controversy over the non-genomic progesterone signalling. In human sperm, either the CatSper channel itself or an associated protein serves as the non-genomic progesterone receptor. The identification of CatSper channel blockers will greatly facilitate the study of Ca(2+) signalling in sperm and help to define further the physiological role of progesterone and CatSper.",1

15981765,Non-progressive congenital ataxia with cerebellar hypoplasia in three families,"AIM: Non-progressive ataxias with cerebellar hypoplasia are a rarely seen heterogeneous group of hereditary cerebellar ataxias. METHOD: Three sib pairs from three different families with this entity have been reviewed, and differential diagnosis has been discussed. RESULTS: In two of the families, the parents were consanguineous. Walking was delayed in all the children. Truncal and extremity ataxia were then noticed. Ataxia was severe in one child, moderate in two children, and mild in the remaining three. Neurological examination revealed horizontal, horizonto-rotatory and/or vertical nystagmus, variable degrees of mental retardation, and pyramidal signs besides truncal and extremity ataxia. In all the cases, cerebellar hemisphere and vermis hypoplasia were detected in MRI. During the follow-up period, a gradual clinical improvement was achieved in all the children. CONCLUSION: Inheritance should be considered as autosomal recessive in some of the non-progressive ataxic syndromes. Congenital non-progressive ataxias are still being investigated due to the rarity of large pedigrees for genetic studies. If further information on the aetiopathogenesis and clinical progression of childhood ataxias associated with cerebellar hypoplasia is to be acquired, a combined evaluation of metabolic screening, long-term follow-up and radiological analyses is essential.",1
32331249,Changes in the Expression of Pre-Replicative Complex Genes in hTERT and ALT Pediatric Brain Tumors,"Background: The up-regulation of a telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM) is a common feature of cancer cells and a hallmark of cancer. Routine methods for detecting TMMs in tumor samples are still missing, whereas telomerase targeting treatments are becoming available. In paediatric cancers, alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is found in a subset of sarcomas and malignant brain tumors. ALT is a non-canonical mechanism of telomere maintenance developed by cancer cells with no-functional telomerase. Methods: To identify drivers and/or markers of ALT, we performed a differential gene expression analysis between two zebrafish models of juvenile brain tumors, that differ only for the telomere maintenance mechanism adopted by tumor cells: one is ALT while the other is telomerase-dependent. Results: Comparative analysis of gene expression identified five genes of the pre-replicative complex, ORC4, ORC6, MCM2, CDC45 and RPA3 as upregulated in ALT. We searched for a correlation between telomerase levels and expression of the pre-replicative complex genes in a cohort of paediatric brain cancers and identified a counter-correlation between telomerase expression and the genes of the pre-replicative complex. Moreover, the analysis of ALT markers in a group of 20 patients confirmed the association between ALT and increased RPA and decreased H3K9me3 localization at telomeres. Conclusions: Our study suggests that telomere maintenance mechanisms may act as a driver of telomeric DNA replication and chromatin status in brain cancers and identifies markers of ALT that could be exploited for precise prognostic and therapeutic purposes.",0
10943655,Cold pressor test and retinal capillary perfusion in vasospastic subjects with and without capsular glaucoma (a preliminary study),"PURPOSE: Using the cold pressor test the authors investigated the change in retinal and neuroretinal capillary perfusion in vasospastic patients suffering from capsular glaucoma (CG) and in vasospastic control subjects. METHODS: Changes in retinal and optic nerve head capillary perfusion induced by the cold pressor test (one hand immersed in 4 degrees C water for 30 seconds, then in 30 degrees C water for 2 minutes) was measured using the Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter in 4 patients with CG and in 5 healthy control subjects. Previously all subjects showed a reduction of cutaneous capillary flow higher than 70% in the cold pressor test (vasospastic reaction). One eye per subject was investigated. Two images were obtained for each phase (baseline, cold phase and warm phase), and the better quality image from each phase was selected for the measurements. One location on the temporal neuroretinal rim and one location on the temporal retina outside the peripapillary area were selected for the HRF measurements. RESULTS: In the CG group neuroretinal rim ",0
14734530,"FoxO3a regulates erythroid differentiation and induces BTG1, an activator of protein arginine methyl transferase 1","Erythropoiesis requires tight control of expansion, maturation, and survival of erythroid progenitors. Because activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is required for erythropoietin/stem cell factor-induced expansion of erythroid progenitors, we examined the role of the PI3K-controlled Forkhead box, class O (FoxO) subfamily of Forkhead transcription factors. FoxO3a expression and nuclear accumulation increased during erythroid differentiation, whereas untimely induction of FoxO3a activity accelerated differentiation of erythroid progenitors to erythrocytes. We identified B cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1)/antiproliferative protein 2 as a FoxO3a target gene in erythroid progenitors. Promoter studies indicated BTG1 as a direct target of FoxO3a. Expression of BTG1 in primary mouse bone marrow cells blocked the outgrowth of erythroid colonies, which required a domain of BTG1 that binds protein arginine methyl transferase 1. During erythroid differentiation, increased arginine methylation coincided with BTG1 expression. Concordantly, inhibition of methyl transferase activity blocked erythroid maturation without affecting expansion of progenitor cells. We propose FoxO3a-controlled expression of BTG1 and subsequent regulation of protein arginine methyl transferase activity as a novel mechanism controlling erythroid expansion and differentiation.",1
12682776,Positional cloning of jcpk/bpk locus of the mouse,"By positional cloning techniques, we have identified the gene that is disrupted in the jcpk and bpk mouse models for polycystic kidney disease. This gene is the mouse homolog of the Drosophila Bicaudal C gene. Both of these mutations have been mapped to a very short stretch of Chromosome (Chr) 10. By sequencing the bicaudal C gene, Bicc1, in these models, it was found that the jcpk mutation results in a shortened and abnormal transcript, whereas the bpk mutation results in an abnormal 3' coding region. In Drosophila, this gene encodes a protein known to influence developmental processes. The mammalian homolog contains three KH (K homology) domains and a SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain and is expressed in the developing embryo, indicating that it may be important in RNA-binding and/or protein interactions during embryogenesis.",1
27809803,A prospective study of treatment of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections and risk factors associated with outcome,"BACKGROUND: To describe the clinical and microbiological data of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections, the treatment used, hospital- and infection-related mortality, and risk factors for death. METHODS: A prospective cohort conducted from March 2011 to December 2012. Clinical, demographic, and microbiological data such as in vitro sensitivity, clonality, carbapenemase gene mortality related to infection, and overall mortality were evaluated. Data were analyzed using Epi Info version 7.0 (CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA) and SPSS (Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-seven patients were evaluated. Pneumonia, 52 (42 %), and urinary tract infections (UTI), 51 (40.2 %), were the most frequent sites of infection. The isolates were polyclonal; the Bla KPC gene was found in 75.6 % of isolates, and 27 % of isolates were resistant to colistin. Mortality related to infection was 34.6 %, and was higher among patients with pneumonia (61.4 %). Combination therapy was used in 98 (77.2 %), and monotherapy in 22.8 %; 96.5 % of them were UTI patients. Shock, age, and dialysis were independent risk factors for death. There was no difference in infection-related death comparing colistin-susceptible and colistin-resistant infections (p = 0.46); neither in survival rate comparing the use of combination therapy with two drugs or more than two drugs (p = 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: CRE infection mortality was higher among patients with pneumonia. Infections caused by colistin-resistant isolates did not increase mortality. The use of more than two drugs on combination therapy did not show a protective effect on outcome. The isolates were polyclonal, and the bla KPC gene was the only carbapenemase found. Shock, dialysis, and age over 60 years were independent risk factors for death.",0

19946550,Acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia: a case report and review of the literature,"INTRODUCTION: Organising pneumonia is a distinct histopathological entity characterized by intra-alveolar buds of granulation tissue, called Masson bodies, which mainly comprise of activated fibroblasts and loose connective tissue. This histopathologic pattern has been described in idiopathic cases, characterizing cryptogenic organising pneumonia as well as in the context of pulmonary infection, drug-induced pneumonitis and following lung transplantation. Although distinct as a clinical and pathological entity, community organising pneumonia may present with atypical clinical and pathological features, such as intra-alveolar fillings of fibrin balls and organising tissue that resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome or diffuse alveolar damage. The latter characteristics constitute a recently described anatomoclinical entity called acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe a rare case of acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia, in an otherwise healthy 65-year-old Greek woman who complained of dry cough, fever, weight loss and progressive dyspnoea. She had never been a smoker. Her clinical symptoms showed a rapid deterioration in the two weeks before admission, despite a course of oral antibiotics. After excluding infection and malignancy with routine laboratory tests and flexible bronchoscopy, high resolution computed tomography and video assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy were performed. Diagnosis was based on radiological features typical of community organising pneumonia coupled with pathologic features characteristic of acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and showed excellent clinical and radiological response three months after treatment initiation. CONCLUSION: Acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia is an extremely rare pathologic entity, often misdiagnosed as typical community organising pneumonia. To our knowledge, this is the seventh case of acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia in the literature, with no identifiable cause or association in a female patient, with no underlying lung disease or known exposures and with an unremarkable previous medical history. We highlight the need for careful review of lung biopsies from patients with clinical and radiologic characteristics typical of community organising pneumonia. Although it remains uncertain whether fibrin alters the favourable prognosis and treatment response of community organising pneumonia, it becomes obvious that a thorough pathologic review, apart from establishing the diagnosis of acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia, may predict a more unfavorable outcome therefore alerting the clinician to administer more aggressive and prolonged therapeutic regimens.",0
15147523,Increased expression of tissue-type transglutaminase following middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats,"Tissue-type transglutaminase (TG-2) has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, induction of TG-2 was studied in rats following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Alterations in 2,3,5-triphenylterazolium chloride staining revealed maximum infarction 3 days after injury. Measurement of mRNA transcript levels by real-time PCR analysis showed both forms of TG-2 mRNA peaking on day 5 after injury in ipsilateral cortex, with greater induction of the full-length TG-2 (TG-L) transcript than the truncated form of the TG-2 (TG-S) transcript. However, in the ipsilateral hippocampus, peak induction of both forms of TG-2 mRNA peaked 1 day after injury and to a lesser extent than observed in the ipsilateral cortex. Western blot analysis demonstrated that TG-L protein expression progressively increased from 1 to 7 days after ischemia, with greater expression in cortex than hippocampus (525 +/- 10% vs. 196 +/- 8% of control, respectively). However, expression of TG-S was not detected. These results demonstrate that increased TG-2 mRNA and protein expression occurs in a delayed fashion following ischemic injury. The temporal profile of TG-2 induction after ischemia was similar to that observed after traumatic brain injury (previously described), suggesting a similar role of TG-2 in both pathological conditions.",0
10030676,Isolation and characterization of a human homologue of the latrophilin gene from a region of 1p31.1 implicated in breast cancer,"We have identified a region of chromosome 1p31.1 that shows high frequency loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in human breast cancer. This region forms part of a 7 Mb YAC/BAC contig. In order to identify candidate sequences, mutation of which might contribute to the development of disease, we have carried out mapping studies of ESTs localized to 1p31.1. This analysis, coupled with library screening and a modified 5' RACE-PCR strategy, resulted in the identification and characterization of a novel gene (LPHH1) which is located adjacent to the smallest region of overlapping loss (SRO) seen in tumours. The 4209 bp open reading frame of the 7 kb LPHH1 transcript encodes a peptide which shows approximately 65% identity to rat latrophilin, a G-coupled, seven span transmembrane protein, which binds alpha-latrotoxin. In the human sequence, whilst conservation of the transmembrane domain is high, the intra- and extracellular domains show two regions of variable structure, which are presumably generated by alternative splicing. Surprisingly, while expression of the rat gene is tightly restricted to neurological and perhaps some endocrine cells, the human sequence appears to be expressed very widely in all normal tissues tested. Northern and RT-PCR analysis of a panel of tumour cell lines showed that LPHH1 expression was variable, apparently elevated in some lines and absent or markedly reduced in others. Furthermore, characterization of the range of transcripts encoded in a breast tumour cell line, compared to normal breast, suggested that gene product variability was higher in the tumour.",1

28059573,"Spirituality, Illness Unpredictability, and Math Anxiety Effects on Negative Affect and Affect-Management Coping for Individuals Diagnosed with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency","A growing number of genetic tests are included in diagnostic protocols associated with many common conditions. A positive diagnosis associated with the presence of some gene versions in many instances predicts a range of possible outcomes, and the uncertainty linked to such results contributes to the need to understand varied responses and plan strategic communication. Uncertainty in illness theory (UIT; Mishel, 1988, 1990) guided the investigation of efforts to feel in control and hopeful regarding genetic testing and diagnosis for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). Participants included 137 individuals with AATD recruited from the Alpha-1 Research Registry who were surveyed about their subjective numeracy, anxiety about math, spirituality, perceptions of illness unpredictability, negative affect regarding genetic testing, and coping strategies about a diagnosis. Results revealed that experiencing more fear and worry contributed both directly and indirectly to affect-management coping strategies, operating through individual perceptions of illness unpredictability. The inability to predict the symptoms and course of events related to a genetic illness and anxiety regarding math heightened fear and worry. Spirituality lessened both illness unpredictability and negative affective responses to a diagnosis. Results affirm the importance of clinician and counselor efforts to incorporate attention to patient spirituality. They also illustrate the complexity associated with strategic efforts to plan communication about the different versions of a gene's effects on well-being, when some versions align with mild health effects and others with severe effects.",0
16995916,Photosynthetic capacity and light harvesting efficiency during the winter-to-spring transition in subalpine conifers,"Some coniferous forest ecosystems undergo complete photosynthetic down-regulation in winter. The present study examined the influence of several environmental parameters on intrinsic, needle-level photosynthesis and photoprotection during the spring reactivation of photosynthesis in subalpine conifers. Maximal photosystem II (PSII) efficiency, photosynthetic capacity, and amounts of zeaxanthin and early light-inducible protein (Elip) family members were assessed in three subalpine conifer species over 3 years, and intensively during the 2003 winter-to-spring transition. During summers, maximal PSII efficiency remained high while intrinsic photosynthetic capacity varied depending on precipitation. During winters and the winter-to-spring transition, photosynthetic capacity and PSII efficiency were highly correlated and (during the spring transition) strongly influenced by air and soil temperature and liquid water availability. Decreases in the amount of Elip family members from winter through spring paralleled disengagement of sustained zeaxanthin-dependent photoprotection, although one of four anti-Elip antibody-reactive bands increased during spring. Intrinsic photosynthetic capacity and maximal PSII efficiency were highly responsive to day-to-day environmental changes during spring, indicating that multiple environmental signals are integrated to orchestrate the reactivation of photosynthesis from the inactive winter state to the active summer state.",0

Four bacteria Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615 and the yeast Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested in two separate experiments using different lots of media. A strain of Aspergillus niger ATCC 16404, was tested by a qualitative streak plate method. The Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems (BDMS) irradiated TSA++ overall recovered a greater number of organisms than the Adams Scientific TSA++ in both experiments and allowed for the earlier recovery of S. pyogenes ATCC 19615. The growth of A. niger ATCC 16404, was comparable on both media. Efficacy of the media to neutralize 1, 2 and 3% phenol as well as 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1% benzalkonium chloride (BC) solutions was done by a disk diffusion method using 2 gram-positive and 4 gram-negative bacteria. Both media showed complete neutralization of the 0.001 and 0.01% BC solutions and partial neutralization of the 0.1% BC solution. The BDMS TSA++ showed better neutralization of the 2 and 3% phenol solutions than the Adams Scientific TSA++. This data indicates that not all irradiated TSA++ media perform in an equivalent manner.",0
8490647,Isolation of a partial candidate gene for Menkes disease by positional cloning,"Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting in death in early infancy. The gene has been mapped to band Xq13 based, in part, on a translocation breakpoint in a female with the disease, which was found to lie within 300 kilobases (kb) of the PGK-1 locus, allowing the isolation of a YAC clone spanning the breakpoint. Phage subclones from the breakpoint region were isolated and used to screen cDNA libraries. cDNA clones were found which detect an 8 kb transcript from normal individuals but show diminished or absent hybridization in Menkes disease patients. Partial sequence of the cDNA shows a unique open reading frame containing putative metal binding motifs which have been found in heavy metal resistance genes in bacteria. This gene is a strong candidate for the Menkes disease gene.",1

Although numerous environmental risk factors have already been identified, the basis for familial occurrence of asthma remains unclear. Previous genome screens for atopy in British/Australian families and for asthma in different American populations showed inconsistent results. We report a sib pair study of a sample of 97 families, including 415 persons and 156 sib pairs. Following an extensive clinical evaluation, all participants were genotyped for 351 polymorphic dinucleotide markers. Linkage analysis for asthma identified four chromosomal regions that could to be linked to asthma: chromosome 2 (at marker D2S2298, P = 0.007), chromosome 6 (around D6S291, lowest P = 0.008), chromosome 9 (proximal to D9S1784, P = 0.007), and chromosome 12 (D12S351, P = 0.010). These linkage regions could be reproduced for all loci by analysis of total or specific immunoglobulin E (minimum P values at these regions were 0. 003, 0.001, 0.010, and 0.015, respectively).",1
29019213,Expression and characterization of a novel omega-transaminase from Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN,"Production of chiral amines and unnatural amino-acid using omega-transaminase can be achieved by kinetic resolution and asymmetric synthesis, thus omega-transaminase is of great importance in the synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates. By genomic data mining, a putative omega-transaminase gene hbp was found in Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN. The gene was cloned and over-expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant enzyme (HBP) was purified by Ni-NTA column and its catalytic properties and substrate profile were studied. HBP showed high relative activity (33.80 U/mg) and enantioselectivity toward beta-phenylalanine (beta-Phe). The optimal reaction temperature and pH were 40  and 8.0-8.5, respectively. We also established a simpler and more effective method to detect the deamination reaction of beta-Phe by UV absorption method using microplate reader, and demonstrated the thermodynamic property of this reaction. The substrate profiling showed that HBP was specific to beta-Phe and its derivatives as the amino donor. HBP catalyzed the resolution of rac-beta-Phe and its derivatives, the products (R)-amino acids were obtained with about 50% conversions and 99% ee.",0

16041383,Angiotensin II and EGF receptor cross-talk in chronic kidney diseases: a new therapeutic approach,"Mechanisms of progression of chronic renal diseases, a major healthcare burden, are poorly understood. Angiotensin II (AngII), the major renin-angiotensin system effector, is known to be involved in renal deterioration, but the molecular pathways are still unknown. Here, we show that mice overexpressing a dominant negative isoform of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were protected from renal lesions during chronic AngII infusion. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and its sheddase, TACE (also known as ADAM17), were induced by AngII treatment, TACE was redistributed to apical membranes and EGFR was phosphorylated. AngII-induced lesions were substantially reduced in mice lacking TGF-alpha or in mice given a specific TACE inhibitor. Pharmacologic inhibition of AngII prevented TGF-alpha and TACE accumulation as well as renal lesions after nephron reduction. These findings indicate a crucial role for AngII-dependent EGFR transactivation in renal deterioration and identify in TACE inhibitors a new therapeutic strategy for preventing progression of chronic renal diseases.",1
8800454,Variable kidney position mimicking renal artery branch stenosis in a Tc-99m-DTPA captopril scintigraphy,"Tc-99m-DTPA captopril scintigraphy was performed in a patient with suspected renovascular hypertension. Markedly impaired right renal function (Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values for the right kidney = 14 ml/min, left kidney = 79 ml/min) was detected in the initial captopril study. Only lower pole activity of the right kidney was observed during the whole study. Since prior ultrasonographic examinations have shown bilateral normal kidney parenchyma, branch stenosis of the right upper pole was suspected. Besides significant function improvement in the following baseline study (GFR values for the right kidney = 59 ml/min, left kidney = 79 ml/min), the right kidney, this time normally shaped, was visibly higher positioned. Because of the possibility of mobile kidney and/or branch stenosis, the patient underwent selective renal angiography. A long pediculed right kidney without renal artery stenosis was found. The final diagnosis was essential hypertension. Kidney position anomalies could influence the reliability of the captopril scintigraphy, particularly when a theoretical kidney depth formula is employed for the attenuation correction.",0

We report a patient with immunoglobulin D (IgD) lambda type MM with presenting symptoms related to mucocutaneous amyloidosis and also amyloid arthropathy. He had no clinical and laboratory involvement due to nephrotic syndrome or cardiomyopathy. IgD myeloma is a rare form of MM and therefore much of the information about the disease is derived from case reports describing patients with associated symptoms.

9443866,Ataxia-telangiectasia: identification and detection of founder-effect mutations in the ATM gene in ethnic populations,"To facilitate the evaluation of ATM heterozygotes for susceptibility to other diseases, such as breast cancer, we have attempted to define the most common mutations and their frequencies in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) homozygotes from 10 ethnic populations. Both genomic mutations and their effects on cDNA were characterized. Protein-truncation testing of the entire ATM cDNA detected 92 (66%) truncating mutations in 140 mutant alleles screened. The haplotyping of patients with identical mutations indicates that almost all of these represent common ancestry and that very few spontaneously recurring ATM mutations exist. Assays requiring minimal amounts of genomic DNA were designed to allow rapid screening for common ethnic mutations. These rapid assays detected mutations in 76% of Costa Rican patients (3), 50% of Norwegian patients (1), 25% of Polish patients (4), and 14% of Italian patients (1), as well as in patients of Amish/Mennonite and Irish English backgrounds. Additional mutations were observed in Japanese, Utah Mormon, and African American patients. These assays should facilitate screening for A-T heterozygotes in the populations studied.",1
6402711,An inherited polymorphism in the human apolipoprotein A-I gene locus related to the development of atherosclerosis,"Epidemiological studies have identified elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL) and diminished high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels as risk factors for coronary artery disease. The major protein component of HDL is apoprotein A-I (apo A-I), a polypeptide of 243 amino acids of known primary amino acid sequence. This apoprotein serves as a cofactor for the plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) enzyme responsible for the formation of most cholesteryl esters in plasma, and also promotes cholesterol efflux from cells. The primary translation product of apo A-I contains both a pre and a pro segment, and post-translational processing of apo A-I may be involved in the formation of the functional plasma apo A-I isoproteins. Defective apo A-I processing may be the underlying problem in Tangier disease, in which patients have low plasma HDL and apo A-I levels despite normal apo A-I synthesis. Patients have been reported with conditions distinct from Tangier disease in whom severe deficiency or absence of apo A-I has been associated with very low HDL levels and severe coronary artery disease. We have now examined the apo A-I gene in two such patients and their first degree relatives. These patients have been reported to have skin and tendon xanthomas, corneal clouding and severe premature coronary atherosclerosis associated with very low HDL levels and deficiencies of two apoproteins, apo A-I and apo C-III. We show that both probands are homozygous for a defect in the apo A-I gene locus.",1
27696557,Changing epidemiology of oral squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue: A global study,"BACKGROUND: There are reports about the changing epidemiology of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), with recent reports indicating an increasing incidence in young women. METHODS: Data on incident cases of tongue SCC were collected from cancer registries worldwide. RESULTS: Data from a total of 22 cancer registries and 89,212 incident cases of tongue SCC worldwide were included. Most areas experienced an incidence increase ranging from 0.4% to 3.3% per year. There was a significant difference in the incidence increase between sexes in 11 of the 22 registries. In 14 of the 22 registries studied, the increase in incidence of tongue SCC was higher in the group of subjects <45 years old than those >/=45 years old. CONCLUSION: This study suggests a general but not universal increase in the incidence of tongue SCC worldwide. In some regions of the world, we observed a shifting trend toward women and/or younger patients. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 39: 297-304, 2017.",0
15044805,G protein-coupled receptor-dependent development of human frontal cortex,"The mammalian cerebral cortex is characterized by complex patterns of anatomical and functional areas that differ markedly between species, but the molecular basis for this functional subdivision is largely unknown. Here, we show that mutations in GPR56, which encodes an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a large extracellular domain, cause a human brain cortical malformation called bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). BFPP is characterized by disorganized cortical lamination that is most severe in frontal cortex. Our data suggest that GPCR signaling plays an essential role in regional development of human cerebral cortex.",1
9122215,Detection of heterozygous truncating mutations in the BRCA1 and APC genes by using a rapid screening assay in yeast,"The detection of inactivating mutations in tumor suppressor genes is critical to their characterization, as well as to the development of diagnostic testing. Most approaches for mutational screening of germ-line specimens are complicated by the fact that mutations are heterozygous and that missense mutations are difficult to interpret in the absence of information about protein function. We describe a novel method using Saccharomyces cerevisiae for detecting protein-truncating mutations in any gene of interest. The PCR-amplified coding sequence is inserted by homologous recombination into a yeast URA3 fusion protein, and transformants are assayed for growth in the absence of uracil. The high efficiency of homologous recombination in yeast ensures that both alleles are represented among transformants and achieves separation of alleles, which facilitates subsequent nucleotide sequencing of the mutated transcript. The specificity of translational initiation of the URA3 gene leads to minimal enzymatic activity in transformants harboring an inserted stop codon, and hence to reliable distinction between specimens with wild-type alleles and those with a heterozygous truncating mutation. This yeast-based stop codon assay accurately detects heterozygous truncating mutations in the BRCA1 gene in patients with early onset of breast cancer and in the APC gene in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. This approach offers a rapid and reliable method for genetic diagnosis in individuals at high risk for germ-line mutations in cancer susceptibility genes.",1
20685668,Germline APC mutation spectrum derived from 863 genomic variations identified through a 15-year medical genetics service to French patients with FAP,"Heterozygous APC germline alteration is responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis, a colon cancer predisposition with almost complete penetrance. Point mutations generally lead to truncated proteins or no protein at all. They mainly involve exon 3 to codon 1700 (exon 15). The work presented here delineates precisely the APC mutation spectrum from 15 years of systematic molecular screening which identified 863 independent alterations in the French population.",1
3839802,Identification of a point mutation in the adenosine deaminase gene responsible for immunodeficiency,"Deficiency of adenosine deaminase (ADA) is the cause of an autosomal recessive form of immunodeficiency. We sought to define, at a molecular level, the mutations responsible for ADA deficiency in the cell line GM-1715, derived from an immunodeficient patient. Full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) for ADA was synthesized and cloned from the cell line. Sequence analysis of the clones revealed a point mutation in codon 101 (CGG to CAG) that predicts an amino acid change from arginine to glutamine. Southern blot analysis, based on silent polymorphisms in the cDNA sequence, indicated that only one of the defective alleles of the GM-1715 line had been sequenced. The mutation that was identified appears to be responsible for the loss of function in this allele, since the predicted primary structure of the enzyme is otherwise entirely normal.",1
16258209,Development of hepatocellular carcinoma in a woman with HBV- and HCV-negative autoimmune hepatitis with unsatisfactory response to Corticosteroid,"A 57-year-old woman was admitted due to a hemorrhage from esophageal varices. Laboratory tests showed liver dysfunction, elevated immunoglobulin G levels and positivity for anti-nuclear antibodies. Serum hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus markers were negative. The liver biopsy specimen was compatible with autoimmune hepatitis, and low-dose prednisolone was started. During the follow-up, her serum alanine aminotransferase levels continued to fluctuate between 40 and 60 IU/l. Nine years later, hepatocellular carcinoma 20 mm in diameter was detected. This case suggests that hepatocellular carcinoma develops even if serum alanine aminotransferase levels are maintained at less than twice the upper normal limit.",0
19197242,Snail1 controls bone mass by regulating Runx2 and VDR expression during osteoblast differentiation,"Bone undergoes continuous remodelling throughout adult life, and the equilibrium between bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts defines the final bone mass. Here we show that Snail1 regulates this balance by controlling osteoblast differentiation. Snail1 is necessary for the early steps of osteoblast development, and it must be downregulated for their final differentiation. At the molecular level, Snail1 controls bone mass by repressing the transcription of both the osteoblast differentiation factor Runx2 and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes in osteoblasts. Sustained activation of Snail1 in transgenic mice provokes deficient osteoblast differentiation, which, together with the loss of vitamin D signalling in the bone, also impairs osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, the mineralisation of the bone matrix is severely affected, leading to hypocalcemia-independent osteomalacia. Our data show that the impact of Snail1 activity on the osteoblast population regulates the course of bone cells differentiation and ensures normal bone remodelling.",0
29083253,Brood pouch-mediated polystyrene nanoparticle uptake during Daphnia magna embryogenesis,"Nanoplastic debris is currently expected to be ubiquitously distributed in aquatic environments and an emerging environmental issue affecting organisms across trophic levels. While ingestion of particles receives most attention, other routes of uptake and cellular accumulation remain unexplored. Here, the planktonic filter feeder Daphnia magna was used to track routes of uptake and target tissues of polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs). A sublethal concentration of 5 mg L(-1) fluorescent PSNPs (25 nm) was used to monitor accumulation in adult animals as well as their embryos in the open brood pouch. A time series throughout embryonic development within the brood pouch revealed accumulation of PSNP in or on lipophilic cells in the early stages of embryonic development while the embryo is still surrounded by a chorion and before the beginning of organogenesis. In contrast, PSNP particles were neither detected in the gut epithelium nor in lipid droplets in adults. An ex vivo exposure of embryos to PSNP demonstrated a similar accumulation of PSNP in or on lipophilic cells, illustrating the likelihood of brood pouch-mediated PSNP uptake by embryos. By demonstrating embryo PSNP uptake via the brood pouch, data presented here give novel insights in bioaccumulation of nanoparticles and likely other lipophilic contaminants. Since this uptake route can occur within a diverse array of aquatic organisms, this study warrants consideration of brood pouch-mediated accumulation in efforts studying the hazards and risks of nanoparticle contamination.",0
19299585,gamma-Secretase heterogeneity in the Aph1 subunit: relevance for Alzheimer's disease,"The gamma-secretase complex plays a role in Alzheimer's disease and cancer progression. The development of clinically useful inhibitors, however, is complicated by the role of the gamma-secretase complex in regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Notch and other essential proteins. Different gamma-secretase complexes containing different Presenilin or Aph1 protein subunits are present in various tissues. Here we show that these complexes have heterogeneous biochemical and physiological properties. Specific inactivation of the Aph1B gamma-secretase in a mouse Alzheimer's disease model led to improvements of Alzheimer's disease-relevant phenotypic features without any Notch-related side effects. The Aph1B complex contributes to total gamma-secretase activity in the human brain, and thus specific targeting of Aph1B-containing gamma-secretase complexes may help generate less toxic therapies for Alzheimer's disease.",1
7490097,Mapping of the mouse homologue of the Wilson disease gene to mouse chromosome 8,"ATP7B, the gene altered in Wilson disease (WD) patients, lies in a block of homology shared between human chromosome 13q14 and the central region of mouse chromosome 14. However, we have mapped the murine homologue of ATP7B (Atp7b) to mouse chromosome 8 by somatic cell hybrid analysis. Analysis of 80 interspecific backcross offspring was used to position Atp7b close to D8Mit3 and another ATPase locus, Atp4b, on mouse chromosome 8. ATP4B lies in 13q34 and is separated from ATP7B by several loci whose mouse homologues map to mouse chromosome 14. The assignment of Atp7b to mouse chromosome 8 identifies a previously unrecognized region of homology between this chromosome and human chromosome 13. This assignment suggests a possible location for the toxic milk mutation in the mouse, which has been proposed as a homologue of WD.",1
25712363,"Pharmacodynamics of amphotericin B deoxycholate, amphotericin B lipid complex, and liposomal amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus","Amphotericin B is a first-line agent for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. However, relatively little is known about the pharmacodynamics of amphotericin B for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. We studied the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of amphotericin B deoxycholate (DAMB), amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC), and liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB) by using a neutropenic-rabbit model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The study endpoints were lung weight, infarct score, and levels of circulating galactomannan and (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan. Mathematical models were used to describe PK-PD relationships. The experimental findings were bridged to humans by Monte Carlo simulation. Each amphotericin B formulation induced a dose-dependent decline in study endpoints. Near-maximal antifungal activity was evident with DAMB at 1 mg/kg/day and ABLC and LAMB at 5 mg/kg/day. The bridging study suggested that the ",0
28062660,Digital pathology in the diagnostic setting: beyond technology into best practice and service management,"Digital pathology (DP) and whole-slide imaging (WSI) technology have matured substantially over the last few years and there is growing evidence from validation studies that WSI is comparable to glass slides for histopathology diagnosis, although with some limitations, which can be appropriately minimised. Whether the controlled environment of validation studies translates to the same level of robustness when WSI is used in the actual diagnostic setting depends on the technical quality of WSI acquisition and on factors that influence the pre-image acquisition variables including the quality of glass slide inputs, and postimage acquisition variables such as access and use of WSI. The concept of 'DP service management' is introduced to fulfil the holistic needs of a laboratory intending to use the DP solution incorporating WSI for diagnostic purposes. The DP service management team should be an integral part of the diagnostic laboratory as it plays a central role undertaking responsibility to address an extensive range of issues from technical and training to governance and accreditation, hence ensuring a viable and sustainable diagnostic DP integration and usage. The pathologist as a specialist in the field and key decision maker of histopathology diagnoses has the duty and responsibility to acquaint and familiarise with DP and WSI when using the technology, especially on their indications and limitations, so as to take full advantage of these tools to enhance diagnostic quality.",0
21278388,A homozygous nonsense mutation (c.214C->A) in the biliverdin reductase alpha gene (BLVRA) results in accumulation of biliverdin during episodes of cholestasis,"BACKGROUND: Green jaundice is a rare finding usually associated with end-stage liver disease. OBJECTIVE The authors investigated two unrelated Inuit women from different geographical areas in Greenland who had episodes of green jaundice associated with biliary obstruction. METHODS AND RESULTS: The crises were accompanied by increased biochemical markers of cholestasis, together with absent or moderate hyperbilirubinaemia. In contrast, high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry showed hypercholanaemia and high concentrations of biliverdin IXalpha in serum, urine, bile and milk. Hyperbiliverdinaemia disappeared after surgical correction of the cholestasis. Analysis of the coding sequence of the biliverdin reductase alpha (BVRalpha) gene (BLVRA) detected three single-nucleotide polymorphisms: c.90G-->A, c.214C-->A and c.743A-->C, which result in p.Ala3Thr, p.Ser44X and p.Gly220Gly, respectively. With the use of TaqMan probes, homozygosity for c.214C-->A was found in both patients. Both parents of one of these patients were heterozygous for the inactivating mutation. Her brother was homozygous for normal alleles. Although her sister was also homozygous for the c.214C-->A mutation, she had never had hyperbiliverdinaemia or cholestasis. With the use of human liver RNA, the BVRalpha coding sequence was cloned, and the variant containing c.214C-->A was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Both proteins were expressed in human hepatoma liver cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes. Immunoblotting, immunofluorescence and functional assays of BVRalpha activity revealed that the mutated sequence generates a truncated protein with no catalytic activity. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a homozygous BLVRA inactivating mutation indicating that the complete absence of BVRalpha activity is a non-lethal condition, the most evident phenotypic characteristic of which is the appearance of green jaundice accompanying cholestasis episodes.",1
11085536,The 630-kb lung cancer homozygous deletion region on human chromosome 3p21.3: identification and evaluation of the resident candidate tumor suppressor genes. The International Lung Cancer Chromosome 3p21.3 Tumor Suppressor Gene Consortium,"We used overlapping and nested homozygous deletions, contig building, genomic sequencing, and physical and transcript mapping to further define a approximately 630-kb lung cancer homozygous deletion region harboring one or more tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) on chromosome 3p21.3. This location was identified through somatic genetic mapping in tumors, cancer cell lines, and premalignant lesions of the lung and breast, including the discovery of several homozygous deletions. The combination of molecular manual methods and computational predictions permitted us to detect, isolate, characterize, and annotate a set of 25 genes that likely constitute the complete set of protein-coding genes residing in this approximately 630-kb sequence. A subset of 19 of these genes was found within the deleted overlap region of approximately 370-kb. This region was further subdivided by a nesting 200-kb breast cancer homozygous deletion into two gene sets: 8 genes lying in the proximal approximately 120-kb segment and 11 genes lying in the distal approximately 250-kb segment. These 19 genes were analyzed extensively by computational methods and were tested by manual methods for loss of expression and mutations in lung cancers to identify candidate TSGs from within this group. Four genes showed loss-of-expression or reduced mRNA levels in non-small cell lung cancer (CACNA2D2/alpha2delta-2, SEMA3B [formerly SEMA(V), BLU, and HYAL1] or small cell lung cancer (SEMA3B, BLU, and HYAL1) cell lines. We found six of the genes to have two or more amino acid sequence-altering mutations including BLU, NPRL2/Gene21, FUS1, HYAL1, FUS2, and SEMA3B. However, none of the 19 genes tested for mutation showed a frequent (>10%) mutation rate in lung cancer samples. This led us to exclude several of the genes in the region as classical tumor suppressors for sporadic lung cancer. On the other hand, the putative lung cancer TSG in this location may either be inactivated by tumor-acquired promoter hypermethylation or belong to the novel class of haploinsufficient genes that predispose to cancer in a hemizygous (+/-) state but do not show a second mutation in the remaining wild-type allele in the tumor. We discuss the data in the context of novel and classic cancer gene models as applied to lung carcinogenesis. Further functional testing of the critical genes by gene transfer and gene disruption strategies should permit the identification of the putative lung cancer TSG(s), LUCA, Analysis of the approximately 630-kb sequence also provides an opportunity to probe and understand the genomic structure, evolution, and functional organization of this relatively gene-rich region.",1
2338077,"Type 5 acid phosphatase. Sequence, expression and chromosomal localization of a differentiation-associated protein of the human macrophage","The purple acid phosphatases and uteroferrin belong to a diverse multifunctional class of binuclear iron-containing proteins that includes haemerythrin and ribonucleotide reductase. In the pig, uteroferrin has been implicated in the delivery of iron to the foetus, but the role of the related human type 5 acid phosphatase that is principally found in resident tissue macrophages is not yet clear. To define further the function of this metalloenzyme, we have isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone for type 5 acid phosphatase and investigated expression of its gene in human tissues. The phosphatase clone contains an open reading frame of 975 bp and encodes a protein of 325 amino acids, including a signal peptide of 19 residues and two potential sites for N-glycosylation. The type 5 acid phosphatase gene mapped to the short arm of human chromosome 19 and was found to have a restriction fragment length polymorphism on digestion with XbaI. Expression of phosphatase mRNA was restricted to mononuclear phagocytes and the enzyme was induced greater than 20-fold on transformation of normal human monocytes to macrophages by culture in serum-supplemented medium. Type 5 acid phosphatase thus represents a tightly regulated system for the study of molecular events in the differentiation programme of the normal macrophage.",1
2908893,"Purified rat brain myelin contains measurable acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase(s) but little, if any, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase","Previous reports from several laboratories have demonstrated the presence of many lipid-metabolizing enzymes in myelin, including all the enzymes needed to convert diacylglycerol to phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Axonal transport studies had suggested the presence of additional enzymes which incorporate acyl chains into specific phospholipids of myelin. We report here evidence for one such group of enzymes, the acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases. At the same time, activity of acyl-CoA:sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase was negligible in myelin. Oleoyl-CoA and arachidonoyl-CoA were both active substrates for transfer of acyl chains to lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylinositol. Activity in myelin varied from 7 to 19% of microsomal activity, values well above the likely level of microsomal contamination as judged by microsomal markers. Additional evidence for a myelin locus came from assays at sequential stages of purification and from mixing experiments. Arachidonoyl-CoA was somewhat more reactive than oleoyl-CoA toward lysophosphatidylcholine; the myelin Km for these two CoA derivatives was 98 microM and 6.6 microM, respectively. Activity with lysophosphatidylinositol as substrate was approximately 40% of that with lysophosphatidylcholine in myelin, whereas activities with lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylserine were considerably less.",0

On PET/CT images, the lesion presented as a soft tissue mass with irregular shape, invading adjacent peritoneum and showing intense FDG uptake. Based on imaging findings, a malignancy was suspected, and she underwent surgical resection. However, the abdominal wall mass was diagnosed as granulomatous inflammation with a little necrosis by pathological results. Awareness of this benign disease is helpful for an accurate diagnosis of abdominal wall mass.",0
25927581,High density infill in cracks and protrusions from the articular calcified cartilage in osteoarthritis in standardbred horse carpal bones,"We studied changes in articular calcified cartilage (ACC) and subchondral bone (SCB) in the third carpal bones (C3) of Standardbred racehorses with naturally-occurring repetitive loading-induced osteoarthritis (OA). Two osteochondral cores were harvested from dorsal sites from each of 15 post-mortem C3 and classified as control or as showing early or advanced OA changes from visual inspection. We re-examined X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT) image sets for the presence of high-density mineral infill (HDMI) in ACC cracks and possible high-density mineralized protrusions (HDMP) from the ACC mineralizing (tidemark) front (MF) into hyaline articular cartilage (HAC). We hypothesized and we show that 20-microm microCT resolution in 10-mm diameter samples is sufficient to detect HDMI and HDMP: these are lost upon tissue decalcification for routine paraffin wax histology owing to their predominant mineral content. The findings show that microCT is sufficient to discover HDMI and HDMP, which were seen in 2/10 controls, 6/9 early OA and 8/10 advanced OA cases. This is the first report of HDMI and HDMP in the equine carpus and in the Standardbred breed and the first to rely solely on microCT. HDMP are a candidate cause for mechanical tissue destruction in OA. ",0
11163212,The combined functions of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members bak and bax are essential for normal development of multiple tissues,"Proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members have been proposed to play a central role in regulating apoptosis. However, mice lacking bax display limited phenotypic abnormalities. As presented here, bak(-/-) mice were found to be developmentally normal and reproductively fit and failed to develop any age-related disorders. However, when Bak-deficient mice were mated to Bax-deficient mice to create mice lacking both genes, the majority of bax(-/-)bak(-/-) animals died perinatally with fewer than 10% surviving into adulthood. bax(-/-)bak(-/-) mice displayed multiple developmental defects, including persistence of interdigital webs, an imperforate vaginal canal, and accumulation of excess cells within both the central nervous and hematopoietic systems. Thus, Bax and Bak have overlapping roles in the regulation of apoptosis during mammalian development and tissue homeostasis.",1
11359213,Impaired heme binding and aggregation of mutant cystathionine beta-synthase subunits in homocystinuria,"During the past 20 years, cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency has been detected in the former Czechoslovakia with a calculated frequency of 1:349,000. The clinical manifestation was typical of homocystinuria, and about half of the 21 patients were not responsive to pyridoxine. Twelve distinct mutations were detected in 30 independent homocystinuric alleles. One half of the alleles carried either the c.833 T-->C or the IVS11-2A-->C mutation; the remaining alleles contained private mutations. The abundance of five mutant mRNAs with premature stop codons was analyzed by PCR-RFLP. Two mRNAs, c.828_931ins104 (IVS7+1G-->A) and c.1226 G-->A, were severely reduced in the cytoplasm as a result of nonsense-mediated decay. In contrast, the other three mRNAs-c.19_20insC, c.28_29delG, and c.210_235del26 (IVS1-1G-->C)-were stable. Native western blot analysis of 14 mutant fibroblast lines showed a paucity of CBS antigen, which was detectable only in aggregates. Five mutations-A114V (c.341C-->T), A155T (c.463G-->A), E176K (c.526G-->A), I278T (c.833T-->C), and W409_G453del (IVS11-2A-->C)-were expressed in Escherichia coli. All five mutant proteins formed substantially more aggregates than did the wild-type CBS, and no aggregates contained heme. These data suggest that abnormal folding, impaired heme binding, and aggregation of mutant CBS polypeptides may be common pathogenic mechanisms in CBS deficiency.",1
16549761,Enhancement of long-term memory retention and short-term synaptic plasticity in cbl-b null mice,"The cbl-b gene is a member of the cbl protooncogene family. It encodes a protein with multiple domains, which can interact with other proteins in a variety of signaling pathways. The functions of cbl family genes in the brain are unknown. In this report, we used genetic, immunohistochemical, behavioral, and electrophysiological approaches to study the role of cbl-b in learning and memory. Cbl-b null mice developed normally and had no abnormalities in their locomotor performance. In spatial learning and memory studies, cbl-b null and WT mice performed similarly during training. To test memory retention, two probe trials were used. cbl-b null mice performed slightly better 1 day after training. However, in the probe trial 45 days after training, the cbl-b null group showed significantly higher memory retention than WT mice, suggesting an enhancement of long-term memory. Using electrophysiological approaches, we found there was enhanced paired-pulse facilitation in the Schaffer Collateral-CA1 glutamatergic synapses of the cbl-b null mice. On the other hand, there was no difference in long-term potentiation between the two groups of mice. In summary, we provide evidence that (i) cbl-b protein is concentrated in the synaptic regions of CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus; (ii) cbl-b null mice have enhanced long-term memory; and (iii) cbl-b null mice show an enhancement in short-term plasticity. These results indicate that cbl-b is a negative regulator of long-term memory, and its neuronal mechanism regulates synaptic transmission in the hippocampus.",1

8631835,"The mammalian degenerin MDEG, an amiloride-sensitive cation channel activated by mutations causing neurodegeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans","Mutations of the degenerins (deg-1, mec-4, mec-10) are the major known causes of hereditary neurodegeneration in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We cloned a neuronal degenerin (MDEG) from human and rat brain. MDEG is an amiloride-sensitive cation channel permeable for Na+, K+, and Li+. This channel is activated by the same mutations which cause neurodegeneration in C. elegans. Like the hyperactive C. elegans degenerin mutants, constitutively active mutants of MDEG cause cell death, suggesting that gain of function of this novel neuronal ion channel might be involved in human forms of neurodegeneration.",1
9511979,Early treatment of Menkes disease with parenteral copper-histidine: long-term follow-up of four treated patients,"We report on the long-term clinical course of 4 boys with Menkes disease, treated from early infancy with parenteral copper-histidine, with follow-up over 10-20 years. Three of the 4 had male relatives with a severe clinical course compatible with classical Menkes disease. As a consequence of early treatment, our patients have normal or near-normal intellectual development, but have developed many of the more severe somatic abnormalities of the related disorder, occipital horn syndrome, including severe orthostatic hypotension in 2. In addition, 1 boy developed a previously unreported anomaly, namely, massive splenomegaly and hypersplenism as a consequence of a splenic artery aneurysm. Previously reported molecular studies in 2 of these patients had shown gene defects which would have predicted a truncated and probably nonfunctional gene product. Despite the favorable effects on the neurological symptoms, parenteral copper treatment for Menkes disease should still be regarded as experimental. The development of more effective treatments must await a more precise delineation of the role which the Menkes protein plays in intracellular copper trafficking.",1

The only positive response in aberration frequency was obtained when styrene oxide was injected in lethal concentration (500 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) into the animal. One animal out of six showed slightly elevated SCE values after this high dose. The response of the hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes to styrene oxide exposure was found to be rather weak, which may be due to rather high activity of epoxide hydratase in Chinese hamsters as compared to e.g. mouse.",0
24575170,Pattern of failure after high-dose thoracic radiation for non-small cell lung cancer: the University of Michigan experience,"PURPOSE: Our main purpose is to study the pattern of local failure for patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with conformal therapy. METHODS: This study included patients who failed locally and a matched group without failures after 3D conformal radiation per a radiation dose-escalation trial. Radiation doses ranged from 65.1 to 102.9 Gy in 2.1 Gy fractions, originally computed using an equivalent path length algorithm. The recurrent gross target volumes (RGTV) were contoured. The original and recurrent planning target volume (PTV and RPTV) were generated by 1 cm uniform expansion from GTV. DVHs and generalized equivalent uniform doses (EUD={Sigma i (di ) (a) }(1/a) ) were computed. Marginal failures were defined for RGTVs covered by the original 10 to 90 % isodose surfaces. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the failed and control groups with regard to average original GTV volumes, GTV and PTV doses, and minimum PTV doses. Of the 18 RGTVs, four had marginal failure, 12 failed mostly within, and two failed outside of the original PTV. The mean EUDs were 57.1 Gy (95 % confidence interval (CI) 43.9-70.6) and 47.5 Gy (95 % CI 33.7-61.2), for the RGTVs and RPTVs, respectively, significantly below the prescribed doses (p=0.03). EUDs were less than 60 Gy for 39 % of the RGTVs and 56 % of the RPTVs. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent tumors had significantly lower doses than the prescribed dose suggesting that some of these failures could have been avoided with modern technology such as 4D CT simulation and image-guided radiation therapy.",0
30953007,Extreme opponents of genetically modified foods know the least but think they know the most,"There is widespread agreement among scientists that genetically modified foods are safe to consume(1,2) and have the potential to provide substantial benefits to humankind(3). However, many people still harbour concerns about them or oppose their use(4,5). In a nationally representative sample of US adults, we find that as extremity of opposition to and concern about genetically modified foods increases, objective knowledge about science and genetics decreases, but perceived understanding of genetically modified foods increases. Extreme opponents know the least, but think they know the most. Moreover, the relationship between self-assessed and objective knowledge shifts from positive to negative at high levels of opposition. Similar results were obtained in a parallel study with representative samples from the United States, France and Germany, and in a study testing attitudes about a medical application of genetic engineering technology (gene therapy). This pattern did not emerge, however, for attitudes and beliefs about climate change.",0
31948587,Chemical labeling - Assisted mass spectrometry analysis for sensitive detection of cytidine dual modifications in RNA of mammals,"RNA molecules carry diverse modifications that exert important influences in many cellular processes. In addition to the single modification occurring in either nucleobase or 2' hydroxyl of ribose in RNA, some dual modifications occur in both the nucleobase and 2' hydroxyl of ribose in RNA. 2'-O-methyl-5-methylcytidine (m(5)Cm), the dual modifications of cytidine, was first discovered from the tRNA of archaea. Recent studies identified that 2'-O-methyl-5-hydroxymethylcytidine (hm(5)Cm) and 2'-O-methyl-5-formylcytidine (f(5)Cm) were present in the anticodon of cytoplasmic tRNA of mammals. Similar to the series of single modification of cytidines of 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C), 5-hydroxymethylcytidine (hm(5)C), 5-formylcytidine (f(5)C), and 5-carboxylcytidine (ca(5)C) in nucleic acids, the dual modifications of m(5)Cm, hm(5)Cm, f(5)Cm and 2'-O-methyl-5-carboxylcytidine (ca(5)Cm) may also constitute the series of cytidine modifications in mammals. However, it is normally challenging to detect these modifications because of their low endogenous levels. Here, we established a method by chemical labeling-assisted liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis for the sensitive and simultaneous determination of all these four cytidine dual modifications, i.e., m(5)Cm, hm(5)Cm, f(5)Cm and ca(5)Cm. Three different labeling reagents (2-bromo-1-(3,4-dimeth oxyphenyl)-ethanone, BDMOPE; 2-bromo-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-ethanone, BMOPE; 2-bromo-1-(4-diethylaminophenyl)-ethanone, BDEPE) were used for the chemical labeling. The results showed that the detection sensitivities of m(5)Cm, hm(5)Cm, f(5)Cm and ca(5)Cm increased up to 462 folds after chemical labeling. With the developed method, we achieved the simultaneous detection of m(5)Cm, hm(5)Cm and f(5)Cm in RNA of mammals. In addition, we found these cytidine dual modifications mainly exist in small RNA (<200nt) and barely detected in other types of RNA. Moreover, we found that the levels of m(5)Cm in RNA of human lung carcinoma tissues significantly increased, while hm(5)Cm and f(5)Cm significantly decreased compared to tumor adjacent normal tissues. The significant changes of m(5)Cm, hm(5)Cm and f(5)Cm levels may serve as indicator for the detection and prognosis of lung cancer.",0
18806779,"Sae2, Exo1 and Sgs1 collaborate in DNA double-strand break processing","DNA ends exposed after introduction of double-strand breaks (DSBs) undergo 5'-3' nucleolytic degradation to generate single-stranded DNA, the substrate for binding by the Rad51 protein to initiate homologous recombination. This process is poorly understood in eukaryotes, but several factors have been implicated, including the Mre11 complex (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/NBS1), Sae2/CtIP/Ctp1 and Exo1. Here we demonstrate that yeast Exo1 nuclease and Sgs1 helicase function in alternative pathways for DSB processing. Novel, partially resected intermediates accumulate in a double mutant lacking Exo1 and Sgs1, which are poor substrates for homologous recombination. The early processing step that generates partly resected intermediates is dependent on Sae2. When Sae2 is absent, in addition to Exo1 and Sgs1, unprocessed DSBs accumulate and homology-dependent repair fails. These results suggest a two-step mechanism for DSB processing during homologous recombination. First, the Mre11 complex and Sae2 remove a small oligonucleotide(s) from the DNA ends to form an early intermediate. Second, Exo1 and/or Sgs1 rapidly process this intermediate to generate extensive tracts of single-stranded DNA that serve as substrate for Rad51.",1
3840312,"Lipoamide dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase in skeletal muscle. VIII. The influence of temperature and rate of freezing of bovine muscle on the activity and subcellular distribution of the enzymes in the thawed tissue","Samples of bovine muscle (post rigor) were frozen at different temperatures between -5 degrees and -196 degrees C at different freezing rates, and thawed at room temperature. The activities of the mitochondrial enzymes lipoamide dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase were determined in the supernatant of the tissue homogenates in phosphate buffer (total enzyme activity), as well as in the press juice of the intact tissue (enzyme activity in the sarcoplasma). Neither the temperature nor the rate of freezing (varying from 25.5 to 0.01 min/degrees C) showed a significant influence on the total enzyme activities. Freezing at -5 degrees and -10 degrees C (at different rates but without intracellular freezing) and thawing did not result in an appreciable release of enzymes. Below -10 degrees C the release of the three enzymes from their binding to the inner membrane of the mitochondrion into the sarcoplasmic fluid increased upon rapid freezing with decreasing temperature i.e. with increasing intracellular ice formation, whereas at slow freezing (with extracellular ice formation only) freezing below -20 degrees C did not cause further enzyme release. At freezing temperatures below -20 degrees C rapid freezing resulted in a significantly stronger release of the three enzymes than slow freezing. From these results it was concluded that the damage to mitochondrial membranes upon fast freezing is primarily a result of intracellular (and perhaps also intramitochondrial) ice formation, whereas the membrane damage during slow freezing is primarily due to dehydration caused by the migration of water from the muscle fibers into the extracellular space as a result of osmotic effects. Ion concentration in the nonfreezing fraction of tissue water seems to be only of minor importance for the disintegration of mitochondrial membranes.",0
16728712,Alteration of the pulmonary surfactant system in full-term infants with hereditary ABCA3 deficiency,"RATIONALE: ABCA3 mutations are known to cause fatal surfactant deficiency. OBJECTIVE: We studied ABCA3 protein expression in full-term newborns with unexplained respiratory distress syndrome (URDS) as well as the relevance of ABCA3 mutations for surfactant homeostasis. METHODS: Lung tissue of infants with URDS was analyzed for the expression of ABCA3 in type II pneumocytes. Coding exons of the ABCA3 gene were sequenced. Surfactant protein expression was studied by immunohistochemistry, immunoelectron microscopy, and Western blotting. RESULTS: ABCA3 protein expression was found to be greatly reduced or absent in 10 of 14 infants with URDS. Direct sequencing revealed distinct ABCA3 mutations clustering within vulnerable domains of the ABCA3 protein. A strong expression of precursors of surfactant protein B (pro-SP-B) but only low levels and aggregates of mature surfactant protein B (SP-B) within electron-dense bodies in type II pneumocytes were found. Within the matrix of electron-dense bodies, we detected precursors of SP-C (pro-SP-C) and cathepsin D. SP-A was localized in small intracellular vesicles, but not in electron-dense bodies. SP-A and pro-SP-B were shown to accumulate in the intraalveolar space, whereas mature SP-B and SP-C were reduced or absent, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence that ABCA3 mutations are associated not only with a deficiency of ABCA3 but also with an abnormal processing and routing of SP-B and SP-C, leading to severe alterations of surfactant homeostasis and respiratory distress syndrome. To identify infants with hereditary ABCA3 deficiency, we suggest a combined diagnostic approach including immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and mutation analysis.",1
17922009,STAT5A is epigenetically silenced by the tyrosine kinase NPM1-ALK and acts as a tumor suppressor by reciprocally inhibiting NPM1-ALK expression,"Although STAT5A and STAT5B have some nonredundant functional properties, their distinct contributions to carcinogenesis are not clearly defined. Here we report that STAT5A expression is selectively inhibited by DNA methylation of the STAT5A gene promoter region in cells expressing the oncogenic tyrosine kinase NPM1-ALK (also known as NPM-ALK). The DNA methylation is induced by NPM1-ALK itself via STAT3, and is associated with binding to the promoter of the gene encoding MeCP2 capping protein and with lack of binding of the STAT5A gene transcription activator SP1. Reversal of methylation by the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restores SP1 binding and STAT5A gene expression. Notably, the induced or exogenously expressed STAT5A protein binds to the enhancer and intron 14 of the NPM1-ALK gene and triggers selective suppression of NPM1-ALK expression. These results show that NPM1-ALK induces epigenetic silencing of STAT5A gene and that STAT5A protein can act as a key tumor suppressor by reciprocally inhibiting expression of NPM1-ALK.",1

32197869,Complications of Renal Transplantation That Influence the Presence of Hyperuricemia in Its First Year of Evolution,"INTRODUCTION: Renal transplantation (RT) has evolved to improve its functionality. Some factors have been little studied, one of which is hyperuricemia and its impact on renal graft function. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of complications of renal transplantation and its influence on hyperuricemia values in the first year of evolution. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors completed a retrospective, observational study of 2 RT units in Mexico from January 2013 to December 2017. In total, 1009 files met the inclusion criteria; the levels of uric acid (UA) and creatinine (Cr) were determined before transplantation and in months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 after transplantation. Descriptive analysis was performed with measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, difference of means with Student t test, and SPSS version 25 (IBM, Armonk, NY, United States). RESULTS: The mean pretransplant UA was 6.24 mg/dL (standard deviation [SD] 1.97); per month was 4.73 mg/dL (SD 1.49). There is a difference in means between categorized groups of UA in the 5 post-RT moments (1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months). A positive correlation of 0.41 to 0.47 was found with Spearman's test. The delayed function of the graft influenced in the first month after transplant in presenting hyperuricemia and acute dysfunction in month 6 showed that the rejection had no significance at any time. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between the values of UA and Cr in the RT represents a moderate positive correlation; delayed graft function in the first month impacts the presence of hyperuricemia, as well as acute dysfunction at month 6 after transplantation.",0
2825385,Phosphate inhibition of the conversion of ribose-1-phosphate--a product of purine nucleoside phosphorylase splitting in the phosphoribomutase reaction,"Different phosphate concentrations were studied for their effect on the degradation of adenosine by rat liver homogenates. It is shown that phosphate considerably inhibits the phosphoribomutase reaction without a significant effect on adenosine deaminase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase activities, that leads to the ribose-1-phosphate accumulation and to the disturbance of nucleoside utilization in reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway. It is supposed that the inhibition of the phosphoribomutase reaction by phosphate is important for regulation of nucleoside and nucleotide formation in a cell.",0
12519860,Genetic variations in calpain-10 gene are not a major factor in the occurrence of type 2 diabetes in Japanese,"The 112/121 haplotype combination defined by the UCSNP-43, -19, and -63 alleles in the calpain-10 gene is associated with type 2 diabetes in Mexican Americans. To determine whether this genetic variation constitutes risk of type 2 diabetes in Japanese, we investigated its frequency in 177 patients with type 2 diabetes and 172 controls. Though this variation occurs in Japanese more frequently than in Mexican Americans, there is no significant difference in frequency between diabetic (29.9%) and control (31.9%) subjects. We also screened all exons and the putative promoter of the calpain-10 gene for mutations in 96 of the genotyped patients, resulting in the identification of 7 coding variants, including 3 missense mutations and 5 nucleotide alterations in the promoter. However, their frequencies all are similar in patients and controls, suggesting that these genetic variations are not a major factor in the occurrence of type 2 diabetes in Japanese, although they could yet be associated with various phenotypes of the disease.",1
14500210,Usefulness of the simultaneous acquisition of spatial harmonics technique during MRI of the shoulder,"OBJECTIVE: The simultaneous acquisition of spatial harmonics (SMASH) technique is a parallel imaging technique that uses fewer echoes than conventional techniques to obtain the desired resolution. Production of images occurs more quickly with parallel imaging than with conventional imaging. This study assesses the usefulness of the SMASH technique for MRI of the shoulder. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Five experienced musculoskeletal radiologists prospectively interpreted MRIs of the shoulder in 50 consecutive patients. All patients underwent a complete MRI examination of the shoulder on a 1.5-T commercially available scanner. Axial fat-saturated proton density-weighted, coronal T1-weighted, and coronal and sagittal fat-saturated T2-weighted sequences were performed. Patients also underwent SMASH T2-weighted imaging in the coronal and sagittal planes. Coronal and sagittal SMASH T2-weighted imaging took approximately 50% as long to complete compared with conventional T2-weighted imaging. Each radiologist interpreted MRIs of the shoulder without knowing whether the images were obtained using the SMASH or the fat-saturated T2-weighted technique. Twenty-eight of the 50 patients also underwent subsequent arthroscopy, and the results were compared with MRI interpretations based on SMASH and fat-saturated T2-weighted images. RESULTS: We found no intraobserver variability between the interpretations of SMASH imaging and the interpretations of fat-saturated T2-weighted imaging. Of the 28 patients who also underwent subsequent arthroscopy, 19 were found to have full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tears and nine had superior labral anterior-to-posterior lesions. All arthroscopic findings correlated with prospective MRI interpretations. CONCLUSION: SMASH imaging allows significant time savings compared with fat-saturated T2-weighted MRI. We found that the use of the SMASH technique did not affect the MRI interpretation or the clinical outcome of patients.",0
8127202,Partial nephrectomy with a combined CO2 and Nd:YAG laser: experimental study in pigs,"Twenty-eight partial nephrectomies were performed on nine pigs with a simultaneous, coaxial CO2-Nd:YAG laser at power settings of 20 W and 40 W, or with a steel scalpel. A vascular pedicle clamp was used without renal cooling. The time for hemostasis was 4.5 +/- 3.2 min (mean +/- SD) with the laser and 6.4 +/- 2.5 min with the steel scalpel (P = 0.064). There was no difference in the total operation time (10.4 +/- 3.5 min with the laser vs. 11.0 +/- 3.2 min with the steel scalpel, P = 0.470). The mean blood loss with the laser was 17.5 +/- 6.7 g and 22.1 +/- 15.2 g with the steel scalpel (P = 0.299). The number of ligatures needed for complete hemostasis was 2.9 +/- 2.1 with the laser and 5.0 +/- 2.3 with the steel scalpel (P = 0.011). The average thermal damage was 0.23 +/- 0.10 mm. It is concluded that the simultaneous CO2-Nd:YAG laser method can be used in partial nephrectomy and it offers better hemostasis than the conventional technique. Further studies with different power levels are needed.",0
19126664,The angiotensin AT4 receptor subtype as a target for the treatment of memory dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease,"Over recent years antihypertensive drugs, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have been reported to have beneficial effects upon cognitive impairment. Such findings suggest that pharmacological manipulation of angiotensin ligands may be of clinical importance in slowing or halting the cognitive deterioration seen in vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism(s) underlying these improvements in cognitive function remains unclear; however, important leads are emerging. The angiotensin AT4 receptor subtype, discovered by our laboratory in 1992, influences several important behaviours and physiologies, including learning and memory, and may play a role in this cognitive improvement. This review initially describes the therapeutic drugs approved by the Federal Drug Administration and new approaches presently being developed to treat Alzheimer's disease-induced cognitive impairment. Next, the biologically-active angiotensin ligands and their respective receptor subtypes are discussed, followed by the roles of angiotensin II, angiotensin IV, ACE inhibitors and ARBs in cognitive function. We conclude with a working hypothesis concerning the importance of the AT4 receptor subtype as a new potential drug target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease-associated memory loss.",0
12086620,Molecular mechanism for the regulation of protein kinase B/Akt by hydrophobic motif phosphorylation,"Protein kinase B/Akt plays crucial roles in promoting cell survival and mediating insulin responses. The enzyme is stimulated by phosphorylation at two regulatory sites: Thr 309 of the activation segment and Ser 474 of the hydrophobic motif, a conserved feature of many AGC kinases. Analysis of the crystal structures of the unphosphorylated and Thr 309 phosphorylated states of the PKB kinase domain provides a molecular explanation for regulation by Ser 474 phosphorylation. Activation by Ser 474 phosphorylation occurs via a disorder to order transition of the alphaC helix with concomitant restructuring of the activation segment and reconfiguration of the kinase bilobal structure. These conformational changes are mediated by a phosphorylation-promoted interaction of the hydrophobic motif with a channel on the N-terminal lobe induced by the ordered alphaC helix and are mimicked by peptides corresponding to the hydrophobic motif of PKB and potently by the hydrophobic motif of PRK2.",1
17548007,Galeazzi fractures and dislocations,"In 1934, fractures of the middle and distal third of the radius associated with instability of the distal radial ulnar joint (DRUJ) were described by Galeazzi. This type of lesion is characterized by its unstable nature and the need for open reduction and internal fixation to achieve a satisfactory functional outcome. A high index of suspicion should be maintained by the surgeon, and a thorough examination for instability of the DRUJ must be conducted. The marked instability of this fracture-dislocation complex is further enhanced by the disruption of the triangular fibrocartilage complex, either with or without ulna styloid fracture. Treatment in adults is surgical, and both bone and soft tissue injuries should be addressed.",0
15694346,A vital role for Ape1/Ref1 protein in repairing spontaneous DNA damage in human cells,"Discovered as a DNA repair protein, Ape1 has been associated with other functions, notably redox regulation of transcription factors (Ref1 activity). Because deletion of the mouse gene produces embryonic lethality and stable Ape1-deficient cell lines have not been reported, there has been uncertainty about a possible vital cellular function of Ape1. We addressed this issue by using RNA interference (RNAi) in several human cell types. Strong downregulation of Ape1 stopped cell proliferation and activated apoptosis, which was correlated with accumulation of abasic DNA damage. These effects were reversed by expression of yeast Apn1 protein, which is structurally unrelated to Ape1 but shares enzymatic activity in repair of abasic sites (AP endonuclease). Because Apn1 would lack Ref1 activity or the protein interactions of Ape1, we conclude that the AP endonuclease activity is essential for cellular viability. Accumulation of abasic DNA damage from intrinsic sources appears sufficient to trigger cell death when Ape1-mediated repair is deficient.",0
8630239,A family of sulfonylurea receptors determines the pharmacological properties of ATP-sensitive K+ channels,"We have cloned an isoform of the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR), designated SUR2. Coexpression of SUR2 and the inward rectifier K+ channel subunit Kir6.2 in COS1 cells reconstitutes the properties of K(ATP) channels described in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The SUR2/Kir6.2 channel is less sensitive than the SUR/Kir6.2 channel (the pancreatic beta cell KATP channel) to both ATP and the sulfonylurea glibenclamide and is activated by the cardiac K(ATP) channel openers, cromakalim and pinacidil, but not by diazoxide. In addition, SUR2 binds glibenclamide with lower affinity. The present study shows that the ATP sensitivity and pharmacological properties of K(ATP) channels are determined by a family of structurally related but functionally distinct sulfonylurea receptors.",1
22434821,Respiratory syncytial virus potentiates ABCA3 mutation-induced loss of lung epithelial cell differentiation,"ATP-binding cassette transporter A3 (ABCA3) is a lipid transporter active in lung alveolar epithelial type II cells (ATII) and is essential for their function as surfactant-producing cells. ABCA3 mutational defects cause respiratory distress in newborns and interstitial lung disease (ILD) in children. The molecular pathomechanisms are largely unknown; however, viral infections may initiate or aggravate ILDs. Here, we investigated the impact of the clinically relevant ABCA3 mutations, p.Q215K and p.E292V, by stable transfection of A549 lung epithelial cells. ABCA3 mutations strongly impaired expression of the ATII differentiation marker SP-C and the key epithelial cell adhesion proteins E-cadherin and zonula occludens-1. Concurrently, cells expressing ABCA3 mutation acquired mesenchymal features as observed by increased expression of SNAI1, MMP-2 and TGF-beta1, and elevated phosphorylation of Src. Infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the most common viral respiratory pathogen in small children, potentiated the observed mutational effects on loss of epithelial and acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics. In addition, RSV infection of cells harboring ABCA3 mutations resulted in a morphologic shift to a mesenchymal phenotype. We conclude that ABCA3 mutations, potentiated by RSV infection, induce loss of epithelial cell differentiation in ATII. Loss of key epithelial features may disturb the integrity of the alveolar epithelium, thereby comprising its functionality. We suggest the impairment of epithelial function as a mechanism by which ABCA3 mutations cause ILD.",1
11179017,Prevalence and penetrance of germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in a population series of 649 women with ovarian cancer,"A population-based series of 649 unselected incident cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in Ontario, Canada, during 1995-96 was screened for germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. We specifically tested for 11 of the most commonly reported mutations in the two genes. Then, cases were assessed with the protein-truncation test (PTT) for exon 11 of BRCA1, with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for the remainder of BRCA1, and with PTT for exons 10 and 11 of BRCA2. No mutations were found in all 134 women with tumors of borderline histology. Among the 515 women with invasive cancers, we identified 60 mutations, 39 in BRCA1 and 21 in BRCA2. The total mutation frequency among women with invasive cancers, 11.7% (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 9.2%-14.8%), is higher than previous estimates. Hereditary ovarian cancers diagnosed at age <50 years were mostly (83%) due to BRCA1, whereas the majority (60%) of those diagnosed at age >60 years were due to BRCA2. Mutations were found in 19% of women reporting first-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancer and in 6.5% of women with no affected first-degree relatives. Risks of ovarian, breast, and stomach cancers and leukemias/lymphomas were increased nine-, five-, six- and threefold, respectively, among first-degree relatives of cases carrying BRCA1 mutations, compared with relatives of noncarriers, and risk of colorectal cancer was increased threefold for relatives of cases carrying BRCA2 mutations. For carriers of BRCA1 mutations, the estimated penetrance by age 80 years was 36% for ovarian cancer and 68% for breast cancer. In breast-cancer risk for first-degree relatives, there was a strong trend according to mutation location along the coding sequence of BRCA1, with little evidence of increased risk for mutations in the 5' fifth, but 8.8-fold increased risk for mutations in the 3' fifth (95%CI 3.6-22.0), corresponding to a carrier penetrance of essentially 100%. Ovarian, colorectal, stomach, pancreatic, and prostate cancer occurred among first-degree relatives of carriers of BRCA2 mutations only when mutations were in the ovarian cancer-cluster region (OCCR) of exon 11, whereas an excess of breast cancer was seen when mutations were outside the OCCR. For cancers of all sites combined, the estimated penetrance of BRCA2 mutations was greater for males than for females, 53% versus 38%. Past studies may have underestimated the contribution of BRCA2 to ovarian cancer, because mutations in this gene cause predominantly late-onset cancer, and previous work has focused more on early-onset disease. If confirmed in future studies, the trend in breast-cancer penetrance, according to mutation location along the BRCA1 coding sequence, may have significant impact on treatment decisions for carriers of BRCA1-mutations. As well, BRCA2 mutations may prove to be a greater cause of cancer in male carriers than previously has been thought.",1
28305649,An ultrastructural and developmental analysis of the corpus allatum of juvenile hormone deficient mutants ofDrosophila melanogaster,"The ultrastructure of the corpus allatum of theapterous mutantsap (4) andap (56f) ofDrosophila melanogaster during larval-pupal-adult metamorphosis and adult life was correlated with the gland's ability to synthesize juvenile hormone in vitro. During the early wandering period of the third instar of both mutants, a high concentration of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and mitochondrion-scalariform junction complexes are typical features of an active corpus allatum cell. Juvenile hormone biosynthesis by the glands is high at that time and, in fact, only slightly lower than that of wild type glands. In contrast to the wild type gland, the cells of the pupal and pharate adult corpus allatum of both mutants contains highly electron dense mitochondria with tubular cristae but no whorls of smooth endoplasmic reticulum nor glycogen clusters. The frequency and size of the lipid droplets, putatives depots of the juvenile hormone precursors, in cells of theap (56f) gland is a function of the insect's age, but both are lower than in wild type gland cells. Juvenile hormone biosynthesis by both mutant glands remains at the basal level when compared to increased synthesis by the wild type gland. The frequency and density of lipid droplets in cells of theap (4) corpus allatum are much lower than in theap (56f) glands. During adult life, the ultrastructural profile of theap (56f) corpus allatum is similar to that of the wild type gland although the in vitro production of juvenile hormone by the former is much lower than that of the wild type gland. The ultrastructural features of the adult corpus allatum ofap (4) homozygotes reveal precocious degeneration and support the view that this non-vitellogenic mutant is a juvenile hormone deficient mutation.",0
14680718,Sexual dysfunction among patients treated with antidepressants--a Hungarian retrospective study,"The authors have investigated the incidence and several aspects of sexual problems in Hungarian outpatients (N = 637) treated by antidepressive medication. In this multicentre epidemiological survey the sexual dysfunctions (SD) was assessed by psychiatrists using structured interviews. Seventy-eight of the sample has sexual problems, more than half of them mentioned SD after starting antidepressive medication. Comparing various groups of antidepressants, patients taking a RIMA compound reported the occurrence of SD not so often as in TCA or SSRI groups, where the rate of SD was very high. Authors pointed out that physicians have to pay special attention to this problem in everyday clinical practice, since the recognition and treatment of sexual dysfunction is critical for the patient's satisfaction, medication compliance and the quality of life.",0
32109894,A wireless optical handheld device for carotid waveform measurement and its validation in a clinical study,"OBJECTIVE: Here we introduce Vivio, a wireless optical tonometer, and compare its pulse waveform measurement capabilities to the AtCor SphygmoCor. APPROACH: Pulse waveform data from both devices was captured on a heterogeneous cohort of 29 participants (15 males, 14 females), including 16 healthy individuals free from cardiovascular diseases and 13 patients with one or more cardiovascular diseases. These participants were a subgroup of the Huntington Medical Research Institutes (HMRI) iPhone Heart Study. Main r esults: Carotid pulse waveforms captured by Vivio were comparable to those captured using the AtCor SphygmoCor tonometer. The point-by-point root-mean-square error between averaged waveforms captured by either device on the same participant was 6.3% with a standard deviation of 2%. The harmonic content of the pulse waveforms captured by either device was also similar. Data collected by Vivio displayed good to excellent agreement across a wide range of pulse waveform features such as left ventricular ejection time, reflected wave arrival time, the ratio of systolic to diastolic time intervals, and heart rate. A comparison between augmentation index (AI) measured by Vivio and tonometry showed a correlation of 0.82 (p < 0.01). Bland-Altman analysis of this data yielded a bias of -2.5% and limits of agreement spanning -15.1%-10.1%. SIGNIFICANCE: The Vivio has the potential to enhance the availability of noninvasive pulse waveform data, thereby expanding the tools available for the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiovascular disease. When used in combination with advanced waveform analysis methods, Vivio can impact mobile healthcare resulting in improved patient health, quality of life and the overall reduction of healthcare costs.",0

9330912,Difference in HMG1-induced DNA bending among microsatellites,"Sequence-dependency of high-mobility group protein (HMG) 1-induced DNA bending is examined for microsatellites using a circularization assay which can measure the extent of bending. Fragments of 133 bp containing (GGA/TCC)11 in the middle showed greater bending than those harboring (GAA/TTC)11 and (GT/AC)17 repeats, and fragments possessing (GA/TC)17 exhibited only slight bending. Differences were not detected for fragments having the repeats near the end. Filter binding assays showed no difference in their binding affinity, suggesting that GGA/TCC repeats are more flexible than the other three repeats as concerns HMG1-induced bending. These results suggest that the mammalian genomes comprise flexible and inflexible regions of microsatellites which might play roles in chromatin architectures and in dynamic packaging of genomic DNA during the cell division cycle.",0
3083735,Cardiovascular changes in dogs given diazepam and diazepam-ketamine,"The cardiopulmonary consequences of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, IV) followed by ketamine (10 mg/kg, IV) were evaluated in 11 dogs. Diazepam did not exhibit a tranquilizing effect and was frequently associated with excessive excitement. It produced minimal cardiopulmonary effects, except for a significant increase in heart rate. Ketamine administration was associated with less cardiovascular stimulation when administered after diazepam than it did when administered alone; the respiratory depression was greater. Compared with ketamine alone, the diazepam-ketamine combination was associated with more vomition, less muscle hypertonus, less seizure activity, and less salivation.",0
22739338,Genetic analysis of SIGMAR1 as a cause of familial ALS with dementia,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron diseases (MND), while frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of early-onset dementia. Many ALS families segregating FTLD have been reported, particularly over the last decade. Recently, mutations in TARDBP, FUS/TLS, and C9ORF72 have been identified in both ALS and FTLD patients, while mutations in VCP, a FTLD associated gene, have been found in ALS families. Distinct variants located in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the SIGMAR1 gene were previously reported in three unrelated FTLD or FTLD-MND families. We directly sequenced the coding and UTR regions of the SIGMAR1 gene in a targeted cohort of 25 individual familial ALS cases of Caucasian origin with a history of cognitive impairments. This screening identified one variant in the 3'-UTR of the SIGMAR1 gene in one ALS patient, but the same variant was also observed in 1 out of 380 control chromosomes. Subsequently, we screened the same samples for a C9ORF72 repeat expansion: 52% of this cohort was found expanded, including the sample with the SIGMAR1 3'-UTR variant. Consequently, coding and noncoding variants located in the 3'-UTR region of the SIGMAR1 gene are not the cause of FTLD-MND in our cohort, and more than half of this targeted cohort is genetically explained by C9ORF72 repeat expansions.",1
32950874,Use and performance of machine learning models for type 2 diabetes prediction in community settings: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify machine learning (ML) models for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) prediction in community settings and determine their predictive performance. METHOD: Systematic review of ML predictive modelling studies in 13 databases since 2009 was conducted. Primary outcomes included metrics of discrimination, calibration, and classification. Secondary outcomes included important variables, level of validation, and intended use of models. Meta-analysis of c-indices, subgroup analyses, meta-regression, publication bias assessments and sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies (40 prediction models) were included. Studies with high-, moderate-, and low- risk of bias were 3, 14, and 6 respectively. All studies conducted internal validation whereas none conducted external validation of their models. Twenty studies provided classification metrics to varying extents whereas only 7 studies performed model calibration. Eighteen studies reported information on both the variables used for model development and the feature importance. Twelve studies highlighted potential applicability of their models for T2DM screening. Meta-analysis produced a good pooled c-index (0.812). Sources of heterogeneity were identified through subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Issues pertaining to methodological quality and reporting were observed. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of good performance of ML models for T2DM prediction in the community. Improvements to methodology, reporting and validation are needed before they can be used at scale.",0
21454754,Proteoglycan-specific molecular switch for RPTPsigma clustering and neuronal extension,"Heparan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs and CSPGs, respectively) regulate numerous cell surface signaling events, with typically opposite effects on cell function. CSPGs inhibit nerve regeneration through receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (RPTPsigma). Here we report that RPTPsigma acts bimodally in sensory neuron extension, mediating CSPG inhibition and HSPG growth promotion. Crystallographic analyses of a shared HSPG-CSPG binding site reveal a conformational plasticity that can accommodate diverse glycosaminoglycans with comparable affinities. Heparan sulfate and analogs induced RPTPsigma ectodomain oligomerization in solution, which was inhibited by chondroitin sulfate. RPTPsigma and HSPGs colocalize in puncta on sensory neurons in culture, whereas CSPGs occupy the extracellular matrix. These results lead to a model where proteoglycans can exert opposing effects on neuronal extension by competing to control the oligomerization of a common receptor.",1
23239121,Linkage analysis of a large African family segregating stuttering suggests polygenic inheritance,"We describe a pedigree of 71 individuals from the Republic of Cameroon in which at least 33 individuals have a clinical diagnosis of persistent stuttering. The high concentration of stuttering individuals suggests that the pedigree either contains a single highly penetrant gene variant or that assortative mating led to multiple stuttering-associated variants being transmitted in different parts of the pedigree. No single locus displayed significant linkage to stuttering in initial genome-wide scans with microsatellite and SNP markers. By dividing the pedigree into five subpedigrees, we found evidence for linkage to previously reported loci on 3q and 15q, and to novel loci on 2p, 3p, 14q, and a different region of 15q. Using the two-locus mode of Superlink, we showed that combining the recessive locus on 2p and a single-locus additive representation of the 15q loci is sufficient to achieve a two-locus score over 6 on the entire pedigree. For this 2p + 15q analysis, we show LOD scores ranging from 4.69 to 6.57, and the scores are sensitive to which marker is chosen for 15q. Our findings provide strong evidence for linkage at several loci.",1
11602897,Transmission of donor cancer into cardiothoracic transplant recipients,"BACKGROUND: The demand for transplantable organs exceeds donor supply. Patients with central nervous system (CNS) or other tumors are controversial donors, and the donor cancer transmission rates in cardiothoracic transplant recipients have not been determined. The Israel Penn International Transplant Tumor Registry (IPITTR) was queried to define the risk of donor cancer transmission in cardiothoracic transplant recipients. METHODS: All heart, lung, or heart-lung recipients of organs from donors with a history of malignancy were reviewed. Donor and recipient demographics, histologic findings, and recurrence were reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients received 17 hearts, 3 lungs, and 2 heart-lung transplants from donors with known CNS or other malignancies. No malignancy transmissions were noted with astrocytomas (n = 3) or glioblastomas (n = 1), except a medulloblastoma that recurred at 6 months. The transmission rate for CNS tumors was 17% (1 of 6), and 1- and 3-year survivals were 67% and 50%, respectively. The most common non-CNS donor cancer was renal cell carcinoma (n = 5). Two renal cell cancer transmissions occurred, both when vascular extension was present. The most aggressive tumor transmission was choriocarcinoma (n = 2) and melanoma (n = 2). Two of 3 choriocarcinomas metastasized with 67% mortality, and both melanomas were transmitted and resulted in death. Other donor cancers included angiosarcoma (n = 2), cervical (n = 1), lung (n = 1), prostate (n = 1), and a liver adenocarcinoma. The transmission rate for all non-CNS groups was 56% (9 of 16) with a 2-year survival of 40%. CONCLUSIONS: The IPITTR experience indicates that tumor transmission is high (10 of 22, 45%) in cardiothoracic transplant recipients. Similar to intra-abdominal organ recipients in the IPITTR, (1) renal cell carcinomas without capsular invasion appear safe with no transmission, (2) vascular invasion in renal cell carcinoma appears to result in early tumor transmission, and (3) melanoma and choriocarcinoma have high rates of transmission with early and almost universal death.",0
1708753,"Humans with OKT4-epitope deficiency have a single nucleotide base change in the CD4 gene, resulting in substitution of TRP240 for ARG240","The OKT4 epitope of the CD4 cell-surface protein has been shown to be polymorphic in white, black, and Japanese populations. The variable phenotypic expression is due to an alteration of the OKT4 epitope, since those persons lacking reactivity with OKT4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) are reactive with OKT4A-F mAb as well as other mAb specific for CD4. To determine the nature of this polymorphism at the gene level, we sequenced polymerase chain reaction-amplified genomic DNA containing the CD4-V3 and -V4 exons from American black subjects who are OKT4-normal, OKT4-negative heterozygous, or OKT4-negative homozygous. Comparison of the sequences revealed that the two CD4 exons are identical except for a cytosine-to-thymidine transition occurring at nucleotide position 868. This alters the first codon position of mino acid 240 and results in a tryptophan residue replacing an arginine residue. The change was also found in white and Japanese persons who are OKT4-negative.",1
8659545,Cloning of the cDNA for a human homologue of the Drosophila white gene and mapping to chromosome 21q22.3,"In an effort to contribute to the transcript map of human chromosome 21 and the understanding of the pathophysiology of trisomy 21, we have used exon trapping to identify fragments of chromosome 21 genes. Two trapped exons, from pools of chromosome 21-specific cosmids, showed homology to the Drosophila white (w) gene. We subsequently cloned the corresponding cDNA for a human homologue of the Drosophila w gene (hW) from human retina and fetal brain cDNA libraries. The gene belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene family and is homologous to Drosophila w (and to w genes from other species) and to a lesser extent to Drosophila brown (bw) and scarlet (st) genes that are all involved in the transport of eye pigment precursor molecules. A DNA polymorphism with 62% heterozygosity due to variation of a poly (T) region in the 3' UTR of the hW has been identified and used for the incorporation of this gene to the genetic map of chromosome 21. The hW is located at 21q22.3 between DNA markers D21S212 and D21S49 in a P1 clone that also contains marker BCEI. The gene is expressed at various levels in many human tissues. The contributions of this gene to the Down syndrome phenotypes, to human eye color, and to the resulting phenotypes of null or missense mutations are presently unknown.",1
17050676,Metastatic tumor antigen 3 is a direct corepressor of the Wnt4 pathway,"Here we show that expression of MTA3 inhibits ductal branching in virgin and pregnant murine transgenic mammary glands. MTA3 also suppresses the Wnt4 pathway and, thus, these findings parallel phenotypic changes in Wnt4-null mice. MTA3 represses Wnt4 transcription and Wnt4 secretion, inhibiting Wnt-target genes in mammary epithelial cells. Accordingly, knockdown of endogenous MTA3 stimulates Wnt4 expression and Wnt cellular targets. The MTA3-NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) complex physically interacts with the Wnt4 chromatin in an HDAC-dependent manner, leading to suppression of the Wnt4 gene and Wnt4-dependent morphogenesis. These findings identify MTA3 as an upstream physiologic repressor of Wnt4 in mammary epithelial cells.",0
11035038,Neonatal mortality in an aquaporin-2 knock-in mouse model of recessive nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,"Hereditary non-X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is caused by mutations in the aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel. In transfected cells, the human disease-causing mutant AQP2-T126M is retained at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it is functional and targetable to the plasma membrane with chemical chaperones. A mouse knock-in model of NDI was generated by targeted gene replacement using a Cre-loxP strategy. Along with T126M, mutations H122S, N124S, and A125T were introduced to preserve the consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation found in human AQP2. Breeding of heterozygous mice yielded the expected Mendelian distribution with 26 homozygous mutant offspring of 99 live births. The mutant mice appeared normal at 2-3 days after birth but failed to thrive and generally died by day 6 if not given supplemental fluid. Urine/serum analysis showed a urinary concentrating defect with serum hyperosmolality and low urine osmolality that was not increased by a V2 vasopressin agonist. Northern blot analysis showed up-regulated AQP2-T126M transcripts of identical size to wild-type AQP2. Immunoblots showed complex glycosylation of wild-type AQP2 but mainly endoglycosidase H-sensitive core glycosylation of AQP2-T126M indicating ER-retention. Biochemical analysis revealed that the AQP2-T126M protein was resistant to detergent solubilization. Kidneys from mutant mice showed collecting duct dilatation, papillary atrophy, and unexpectedly, some plasma membrane AQP2 staining. The severe phenotype of the AQP2 mutant mice compared with that of mice lacking kidney water channels AQP1, AQP3, and AQP4 indicates a critical role for AQP2 in neonatal renal function in mice. Our results establish a mouse model of human autosomal NDI and provide the first in vivo biochemical data on a disease-causing AQP2 mutant.",1
21515265,A non-synonymous nucleotide substitution can account for one evolutionary route to sesquiterpene synthase activity in the TPS-b subgroup,"Plant sesquiterpene and hemiterpene synthases in the monoterpene synthase dominated TPS-b subgroup are thought to have evolved independently from a monoterpene synthase ancestor. A TPS-b sesquiterpene synthase from apple (MdAFS1), which predominantly produces alpha-farnesene, can also synthesize the monoterpene (E)-beta-ocimene. The dual activity offered a functional link to an ancestral MdAFS1 enzyme and a rational basis for investigation of the evolution of TPS-b sesquiterpene enzymes. Protein modelling and mutagenesis analysis of the MdAFS1 active site identified a non-synonymous nucleotide substitution that could account for the requisite shift in substrate specificity necessary for the emergence of its sesquiterpene activity during the evolution of the TPS-b enzymes.",0
32156314,Mir-30b-3p affects the migration and invasion function of ovarian cancer cells by targeting the CTHRC1 gene,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect role and mechanism of miR-30b-3p on ovarian cancer cells biological function. METHODS: The expression of miR-30b-3p was detected in ovarian cancer cell lines and normal ovarian epithelial cell line by qRT-PCR. Mir-30b-3p mimic was transfected into OVCAR3 cells. Cell-counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was conducted to explore the effect of mir-30b-3p on the OVCAR3 cells' proliferation. Cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by Flow cytometry. Cell invasion ability was detected by Transwell test. The regulation of putative target of miR-30b-3p was verified by double luciferase reporter assays and Western blot. RESULT: We found that miR-30b-3p was downregulated in OVCAR3 cells. Overexpression of miR-30b-3p suppressed proliferation, promoted apoptosis, slowed cell cycle and inhibited migration and invasion of OVCAR3 cells. Bioinformatics analysis identified 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of Collagen triple helix repeat-containing 1 (CTHRC1) as the presumed binding site for miR-30b-3p. Detection of double luciferase reporter and Western-Blot result confirmed that CTHRC1 was the target gene of miR-30b-3p. Furthermore, E-cadherin, beta-cadherin and Vimentin protein expression level were changed after transfection of miR-30b-3p. CONCLUSION: miR-30b-3p function as an anti-cancer gene. Overexpression of miR-30b-3p can inhibit the biological function of ovarian cancer cells. MiR-30b-3p targets CTHRC1 gene plays an important role in epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), and supports miR-30b-3p as a potential biological indicator for ovarian cancer in the future.",0
4383750,Influence of carbon tetrachloride on inducible liver enzymes and response to endotoxin in mice,"Injection of mice with a sublethal dose of endotoxin 2 hr after administration of 0.1 ml of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) killed 75% of the animals. CCl(4) alone killed no controls. Significant protection against this effect was afforded by 5 mg of cortisone and by 5 mg of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). With a larger dose of endotoxin, cortisone did not give protection. Liver tryptophan pyrrolase activity was lowered 2 hr after CCl(4) injection and reached a minimum after 17 hr. Induction of tryptophan pyrrolase by cortisone, followed by administration of CCl(4), resulted in rapid loss of activity. A significant induction of tyrosine-alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase was observed in CCl(4)-treated mice. The induction of this enzyme by cortisone was somewhat impaired when CCl(4) was administered concurrently with the hormone. CCl(4) did not lower tryptophan pyrrolase in endotoxin-tolerant mice after 4 hr, but at 17 hr the activity was decreased as much as in control mice. Oxidized pyridine nucleotides were decreased 17 hr after administration of CCl(4). This loss was prevented by administration of NAD (5 mg) or by cortisone (5 mg). Carbon clearance from blood was reduced after treatment with CCl(4). These results indicate a degree of similarity between the metabolic effects of endotoxin and CCl(4) in that both depress tryptophan pyrrolase and prevent its induction by cortisone, and both induce tyrosine transaminase in intact mice. Both substances appear to exert these effects through some type of mediated reaction.",0
18999666,Contribution of drifting carriers to the Casimir-Lifshitz and Casimir-Polder interactions with semiconductor materials,"We develop a theory for Casimir-Lifshitz and Casimir-Polder interactions with semiconductor or insulator surfaces that takes into account charge drift in the bulk material through use of the classical Boltzmann equation. We derive frequency-dependent dispersion relations that give the usual Lifshitz results for dielectrics as a limiting case and, in the quasistatic limit, coincide with those recently computed to account for Debye screening in the thermal Lifshitz force with conducting surfaces with small density of carriers.",0

7782091,Localization of new genes and markers to the distal part of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region and comparison with the mouse: new insights into the evolution of mammalian genomes,"We have refined and extended the map of the distal half of the human major histocompatibility complex. The map is continuous from HLA-E to 1000 kb telomeric of HLA-F and includes six new markers and genes. In addition, the corresponding sequences that were not previously mapped in the mouse genome have been located. The human and the mouse organizations have therefore been compared. This comparison allows us to demonstrate that the structure of the distal part of the MHC is similar in the two species. In addition, this comparison shows the presence of a breakpoint of synteny telomeric of the distal part of the H-2 region. Indeed, the region telomeric of HLA in human is found on a chromosome different from that carrying H-2 in mouse. The mapping analysis of paralogous genes (structurally related genes) around the breakpoint shows that the human organization probably represents the putative human/mouse ancestral one. This evolutionary breakpoint was precisely mapped in human, and the surrounding region was cloned into yeast artificial chromosomes. Finally, we show that the region found around the breakpoint was involved several times in chromosome recombinations in the mouse lineage, as it seems to correspond also to the t-complex distal inversion point.",1
8964872,Recurrent mutations in the vasopressin-neurophysin II gene cause autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus,"We examined the nucleotide sequence of the arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II gene in three kindreds with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. Each of the three different mutations identified represents a recurrence of a mutation previously described to cause this disease. These mutations are all transitions (C1761-->T, G1859-->A, and G279-->A) that encode amino acid substitutions Pro24-->Leu, Gly57-->Ser (both in neurophysin II), and Ala-->Thr (in the last amino acid at the C-terminus of the signal peptide). The presence of these mutations in genomic DNA was confirmed by alterations in restriction endonuclease recognition sites. A linkage map of distal chromosome 20 was constructed. To examine the possibility that these apparent recurrent mutations arose independently rather than by an ancestral founder mutation, we analyzed family origins, two polymorphic markers on chromosome 20 in close proximity with this gene (the oxytocin/XbaI restriction fragment length polymorphism and the D20S57 polymorphic CA repeat microsatellite), and/or the occurrence of a de novo mutation in our three families and in four additional families previously reported. Our results suggest that one of our families may share an ancestral founder mutation with one previously reported family, but that in the remainder of the families with identical mutations, these mutations probably arose independently.",1

The European Consortium on Men1, (GENEM 1; Groupe d'Etude des Neoplasies Endocriniennes Multiples de type 1)","Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant disorder with a high penetrance characterized by tumors of the parathyroid glands, the endocrine pancreas, and the anterior pituitary. The MEN1 gene, a putative tumor suppressor gene, has been mapped to a 3- to 8-cM region in chromosome 11q13 but it remains elusive as yet. We have combined the efforts and resources from four laboratories to form the European Consortium on MEN1 with the aims of establishing the genetic and the physical maps of 11q13 and of further narrowing the MEN1 region. A 5-Mb integrated map of the region was established by fluorescence in situ hybridization on both metaphase chromosomes and DNA fibers, by hybridization to DNA from somatic cell hybrids containing various parts of human chromosome 11, by long-range restriction mapping, and by characterization of YACs and cosmids. Polymorphic markers were positioned and ordered by physical mapping and genetic linkage in 86 MEN1 families with 452 affected individuals. Two critical recombinants identified in two affected cases placed the MEN1 gene in an approximately 2-Mb region around PYGM, flanked by D11S1883 and D11S449.",1
22292780,QSTR with extended topochemical atom (ETA) indices. 15. Development of predictive models for toxicity of organic chemicals against fathead minnow using second-generation ETA indices,"Modern industrialisation has led to the production of millions of toxic chemicals having hazardous effects on the ecosystem. It is impracticable to determine the toxic potential of a large number of chemicals in animal models, making the use of quantitative structure-toxicity relationship (QSTR) models an alternative strategy for toxicity prediction. Recently we introduced a set of second-generation extended topochemical atom (ETA) indices for predictive modelling. Here we have developed predictive toxicity models on a large dataset of 459 diverse chemicals against fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) using the second-generation ETA indices. These descriptors can be easily calculated from two-dimensional molecular representation without the need of time-consuming conformational analysis and alignment, making the developed models easily reproducible. Considering the importance of hydrophobicity for toxicity prediction, AlogP98 was used as an additional predictor in all the models, which were validated rigorously using multiple strategies. The ETA models were comparable in predictability to those involving various non-ETA topological parameters and those previously reported using various descriptors including computationally demanding quantum-chemical ones.",0

14660671,"entla, a novel epileptic and ataxic Cacna2d2 mutant of the mouse","entla (ent) is a novel recessive phenotype of mice. The underlying mutation was mapped to chromosome 9 (60.1 centimorgans) and identified as an allele of the Cacna2d2 gene encoding the alpha2delta-2 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. The Cacna2d2entla allele harbors a 38-kb duplication comprising the 117 nucleotides of exon 3. The predicted duplication of 39 amino acid residues near the subunit's N terminus results in the expression of a full-length, membrane-associated protein. Western blot data were consistent with correct cleavage of the alpha2delta-2entla precursor into alpha2entla and delta2 proteins but indicated loss of the disulfide linkage between the two proteins. ent/ent mice develop ataxia by postnatal day 13-15, followed by paroxysmal dyskinesia a few days later. Two distinct types of cortical and hippocampal epileptic activity at 2 and 4 Hz were recorded, indicative of absence epilepsy. Homozygotes display reduced size and weight, increased mortality before weaning, and female infertility. No overt neuroanatomical abnormalities were detected. Ca2+ current densities recorded from acutely dissociated Purkinje cells of homozygous entla animals were reduced by 50% compared with wild type. Ligand binding assays using the antiepileptic drug [3H]gabapentin, a specific ligand of the alpha2delta-1 and alpha2delta-2 subunits, revealed a >60% reduced maximum binding to cerebellar membranes of ent/ent compared with unaffected littermates. entla is allelic to ducky and ducky2J, representing the third murine Cacna2d2 allele identified and so far the only one encoding an untruncated protein that is incorporated into membranes.",1
22332877,"Cafestol, a coffee-specific diterpene, induces peripheral antinociception mediated by endogenous opioid peptides","The opioid peptides have been implicated in peripheral antinociception induced by non-opioidergic compounds, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and alpha(2) -adrenoceptor agonists. The aims of the present study were to investigate the possible peripheral antinociceptive effect of cafestol, a diterpene present in the oil derived from coffee beans, and to evaluate the involvement of opioid peptides in its effect. The rat paw pressure test was used to assess antinocipeptive effects. Hyperalgesia was induced by intraplantar injection of prostaglandin E(2)  (2 mug/paw). All drugs were locally administered into the hind-paws of male Wistar rats. Intraplantar injection of cafestol (20, 40 and 80 mug) induced peripheral antinociception. The antinociceptive effect of cafestol was due to a local action because the higher dose (80 mug/paw) did not produce any effect in the contralateral paw. The opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (25, 50 and 100 mug/paw) prevented the action of cafestol (80 mug/paw), whereas the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin (400 mug/paw) potentiated the antinociceptive effect of cafestol (40 mug/paw). The results of the present study provide evidence that cafestol treatment has a peripheral antinociceptive effect and suggest that this effect is mediated by the release of endogenous opioids.",0
8406448,"C4BPAL1, a member of the human regulator of complement activation (RCA) gene cluster that resulted from the duplication of the gene coding for the alpha-chain of C4b-binding protein","The regulator of complement activation (RCA) gene cluster evolved by multiple gene duplications to produce a family of genes coding for proteins that collectively control the activation of the complement system. We report here the characterization of C4BPAL1, a member of the human RCA gene cluster that arose from the duplication of the C4BPA gene after the separation of the rodent and primate lineages. C4BPAL1 maps 20 kb downstream of the C4BPA gene and is the same 5' to 3' orientation found for all RCA genes characterized thus far. It includes nine exon-like regions homologous to exons 2-8, 11, and 12 of the C4BPA gene. Analysis of the C4BPAL1 sequence suggests that it is currently a pseudogene in humans. However, comparisons between C4BPAL1 and the human and murine C4BPA genes show sequence conservation, which strongly suggests that, for a long period of time, C4BPAL1 has been a functional gene coding for a protein with structural requirements similar to those of the alpha-chain of C4b-binding protein.",1

28554189,Structure of the human multidrug transporter ABCG2,"ABCG2 is a constitutively expressed ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that protects many tissues against xenobiotic molecules. Its activity affects the pharmacokinetics of commonly used drugs and limits the delivery of therapeutics into tumour cells, thus contributing to multidrug resistance. Here we present the structure of human ABCG2 determined by cryo-electron microscopy, providing the first high-resolution insight into a human multidrug transporter. We visualize ABCG2 in complex with two antigen-binding fragments of the human-specific, inhibitory antibody 5D3 that recognizes extracellular loops of the transporter. We observe two cholesterol molecules bound in the multidrug-binding pocket that is located in a central, hydrophobic, inward-facing translocation pathway between the transmembrane domains. Combined with functional in vitro analyses, our results suggest a multidrug recognition and transport mechanism of ABCG2, rationalize disease-causing single nucleotide polymorphisms and the allosteric inhibition by the 5D3 antibody, and provide the structural basis of cholesterol recognition by other G-subfamily ABC transporters.",1
1707030,"Human aminoacylase-1: cloning, regional assignment to distal chromosome 3p21.1, and identification of a cross-hybridizing sequence on chromosome 18","Aminoacylase-1 (ACY1, EC 3.5.1.14) is a cytosolic enzyme with a wide range of tissue expression and has been postulated to function in the catabolism and salvage of acylated amino acids. ACY1 has been assigned to chromosome 3p21, a region reduced to homozygosity in small-cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma, and has been reported to exhibit reduced or absent expression in small-cell lung cancer cell lines and tumors. Using monoclonal antibodies to human ACY1, we have isolated cDNA clones from a liver lambda gt11 cDNA library. As proof of identity, the fusion protein encoded by a putative ACY1 cDNA displayed ACY1 enzymatic activity. Additionally, it was determined that the putative ACY1 cDNA clones hybridize to an EcoR1 restriction fragment that has been mapped to chromosome 3p. Both ACY1 activity and this restriction fragment have been further demonstrated to be syntenic to distal 3p21.1 through the use of a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids containing fragments of chromosome 3. An additional EcoR1 restriction fragment to which the probe hybridizes has been assigned to chromosome 18. The major mRNA species to which the ACY1 cDNA hybridizes is 0.9 kb; faint hybridization to a 4.2-kb mRNA species is also detected. These studies further refine a region of interest in the investigation of gene inactivation in small-cell lung cancer and provide a new marker on chromosome 18.",1
10945546,Rectal cancer: changing patterns of referral for radiation therapy 1982-1997,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the changing role of radiation therapy in rectal cancer and to determine the patterns of referral of patients during a 15-year period. METHODS: From 1982 to 1997, 464 patients with carcinoma of the rectum were referred to the Department of Radiation Oncology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital: 79% of patients had locoregional disease alone and 21% had distant metastasis. Radiation therapy consisted of irradiation (definitive or palliative) alone to the primary tumour in 9.7% of cases; preoperative radiation in 7.3% of cases: preoperative chemoradiation in 7.5% of patients: postoperative radiation in 15.3% of patients: postoperative chemoradiation in 12.31% of patients: treatment of pelvic recurrence in 23.5% of patients and treatment of metastases in 9.1% of patients. The remainder were treated elsewhere (1.9%) or not treated (13.4%). RESULTS: There was an average annual 14% increase in referrals over the accrual period. Recurrent rectal cancer decreased from approximately 30% of referrals during 1982-91 to approximately 10% in 1995-7. The use of postoperative adjuvant radiation reached a peak of 50% in 1993. The use of preoperative radiation increased suddenly in 1994 from < 10% to a sustained rate of approximately 30% of referrals. The use of chemoradiation commenced in 1990 for postoperative adjuvant treatment and in 1994 for preoperative treatment. The median survival time from initial diagnosis was 35 months, with 2- and 5-year survival rates of 62 and 28%, respectively. Survivals at 5 years for patients treated with preoperative and postoperative radiation (with or without chemotherapy) and with recurrent disease were 56, 44 and 21%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study illustrates the changing role of radiation therapy in the management of rectal cancer. The increase in referrals over the observation period was due to increased multidisciplinary input into the initial management of these patients, based on reported clinical trials. The steady increase in the use of adjuvant therapy has paralleled a decrease in referrals for treatment of recurrence and reflects current clinical results. The sequencing of adjuvant therapy is changing currently, with greater emphasis on preoperative adjuvant treatment. Currently most adjuvant therapy includes chemotherapy.",0
27632415,Quantification of Training Load During Return to Play After Upper- and Lower-Body Injury in Australian Rules Football,"CONTEXT: Training volume, intensity, and distribution are important factors during periods of return to play. PURPOSE: To quantify the effect of injury on training load (TL) before and after return to play (RTP) in professional Australian Rules football. METHODS: Perceived training load (RPE-TL) for 44 players was obtained for all indoor and outdoor training sessions, while field-based training was monitored via GPS (total distance, high-speed running, mean speed). When a player sustained a competition time-loss injury, weekly TL was quantified for 3 wk before and after RTP. General linear mixed models, with inference about magnitudes standardized by between-players SDs, were used to quantify effects of lower- and upper-body injury on TL compared with the team. RESULTS: While total RPE-TL was similar to the team 2 wk before RTP, training distribution was different, whereby skills RPE-TL was likely and most likely lower for upper- and lower-body injury, respectively, and most likely replaced with small to very large increases in running and other conditioning load. Weekly total distance and high-speed running were most likely moderately to largely reduced for lower- and upper-body injury until after RTP, at which point total RPE-TL, training distribution, total distance, and high-speed running were similar to the team. Mean speed of field-based training was similar before and after RTP compared with the team. CONCLUSIONS: Despite injured athletes' obtaining comparable TLs to uninjured players, training distribution is different until after RTP, indicating the importance of monitoring all types of training that athletes complete.",0
24564090,Left ventricular geometry in Nigerians with type II diabetes mellitus,"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular hypertrophy is independently associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular and all cause mortality. In a relatively healthy hypertensive adult population, type II diabetes is associated with higher left ventricular mass, concentric left ventricular geometry and lower myocardial function independent of age, sex, body size, and arterial blood pressure. OBJECTIVE: The study is to investigate left ventricular geometry in Nigerians with Type II Diabetes mellitus. METHODS: The study design was cross-sectional and it comprised 75 consecutive patients with type II diabetes mellitus with or without hypertension. Using a structured pre-evaluated questionnaire, the demographic and clinical data were obtained. All subjects had two dimensional (2D) and 2D derived M-mode echocardiography using Sonoline G60s Ultrasound imaging system with 4.2 MHZ transducer equipped with simultaneous ECG tracing. RESULTS: A total of 75 consecutive type II diabetic patients with or without hypertension were recruited into the study. There were 18 (24.0%) hypertensive-diabetic and 12 (16.0%) normotensive-diabetic males and Thirty-four (45.3%) hypertensive-diabetic and 11 (14.0%) normotensive-diabetic were females. Hypertensive-diabetic males had significantly higher left ventricular mass compared to normotensive-diabetic counterpart 207.05 +/- 41.5g and 156.00 +/- 27.1g P = 0.001. Similarly, left ventricular mass index was found to be higher in hypertensive-diabetic males than their normotensive-diabetic counterpart 114.50 +/- 29.2g/m2 and 92.28 +/- 20.5g/m2 P = 0.014. Hypertensive-diabetic female significantly had higher LVM compared to the normotensive-diabetics 196.06 +/- 41.5g and 161.54 +/- 31.6g P = 0.016. Left ventricular mass index was also found to be higher in hypertensive-diabetic female than their normotensive counterpart 118.52 +/- 27.8g/m2 and 95.75 +/- 23.0g/m2 P = 0.019. Hypertensive-diabetics had predominantly concentric left ventricular hypertrophy compared to the normotensive-diabetics 36 (69.2. %) and 5 (21.7%) P = 0.001. CONCLUSION: The study reported that hypertensive-diabetics have predominantly concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, higher left ventricular mass and left ventricular mass index compared to normotensive-diabetic. Female hypertensive-diabetic had predominantly concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, while male hypertensive-diabetic and normotensive-diabetic had predominantly concentric left ventricular remodelling.",0
25363768,The contribution of de novo coding mutations to autism spectrum disorder,"Whole exome sequencing has proven to be a powerful tool for understanding the genetic architecture of human disease. Here we apply it to more than 2,500 simplex families, each having a child with an autistic spectrum disorder. By comparing affected to unaffected siblings, we show that 13% of de novo missense mutations and 43% of de novo likely gene-disrupting (LGD) mutations contribute to 12% and 9% of diagnoses, respectively. Including copy number variants, coding de novo mutations contribute to about 30% of all simplex and 45% of female diagnoses. Almost all LGD mutations occur opposite wild-type alleles. LGD targets in affected females significantly overlap the targets in males of lower intelligence quotient (IQ), but neither overlaps significantly with targets in males of higher IQ. We estimate that LGD mutation in about 400 genes can contribute to the joint class of affected females and males of lower IQ, with an overlapping and similar number of genes vulnerable to contributory missense mutation. LGD targets in the joint class overlap with published targets for intellectual disability and schizophrenia, and are enriched for chromatin modifiers, FMRP-associated genes and embryonically expressed genes. Most of the significance for the latter comes from affected females. ",1

A large number of the investigated steroids was transformed into 9 alpha-hydroxy-delta 4-3-ketones in satisfactory yields (50-90%) at high initial concentrations of the substrates (0.5-5.0 g/L). The influence of some structural features of the steroid molecule on the progress and effectiveness of the microbial transformation was also shown.",0
24925548,Layers of air in the water beneath the floating fern Salvinia are exposed to fluctuations in pressure,"Superhydrophobic, hierarchically structured, technical surfaces (Lotus-effect) are of high scientific and economic interest because of their remarkable properties. Recently, the immense potential of air-retaining superhydrophobic surfaces, for example, for low-friction transport of fluids and drag-reducing coatings of ships has begun to be explored. A major problem of superhydrophobic surfaces mimicking the Lotus-effect is the limited persistence of the air retained, especially under rough conditions of flow. However, there are a variety of floating or diving plant and animal species that possess air-retaining surfaces optimized for durable water-repellency (Salvinia-effect). Especially floating ferns of the genus Salvinia have evolved superhydrophobic surfaces capable of maintaining layers of air for months. Apart from maintaining stability under water, the layer of air has to withstand the stresses of water pressure (up to 2.5 bars). Both of these aspects have an application to create permanent air layers on ships' hulls. We investigated the effect of pressure on air layers in a pressure cell and exposed the air layer to pressures of up to 6 bars. We investigated the suppression of the air layer at increasing pressures as well as its restoration during decreases in pressure. Three of the four examined Salvinia species are capable of maintaining air layers at pressures relevant to the conditions applying to ships' hulls. High volumes of air per surface area are advantageous for retaining at least a partial Cassie-Baxter-state under pressure, which also helps in restoring the air layer after depressurization.

24085568,Spatial regulation dominates gene function in the ganglia chain,"MOTIVATION: To understand the molecular mechanisms of neurons, it is imperative to identify genomic dissimilarities within the heterogeneity of the neural system. This is especially true for neuronal disorders in which spatial considerations are of critical nature. For this purpose, Hirudo medicinalis provides here an ideal system in which we are able to follow gene expression along the central nervous system, to affiliate location with gene behavior. RESULTS: In all, 221.1 million high-quality short reads were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq2000 platform at the single ganglion level. Thereafter, a de novo assembly was performed using two state-of-the-art assemblers, Trinity and Trans-ABySS, to reconstruct a comprehensive de novo transcriptome. Classification of Trinity and Trans-ABySS transcripts produced a non-redundant set of 76 845 and 268 355 transcripts (>200 bp), respectively. Remarkably, using Trinity, 82% of the published medicinal leech messenger RNAs was identified. For the innexin family, all of the 21 recently reported genes were identified. Spatial regulation analysis across three ganglia throughout the entire central nervous system revealed distinct patterns of gene expression. These transcriptome data were combined with expression distribution to produce a spatio-transcripto map along the ganglia chain. This study provides a resource for gene discovery and gene regulation in future studies.",0
26965455,Polyomavirus infections and its clinical relevance in cancer patients: A Prospective Study,"BK and JC polyomaviruses (PyV) have been demonstrated to be associated with the pathogenesis of various human cancers. We aimed to investigate the impact of BK and JC polyomavirus infections on several clinical parameters in different human cancers. A total of 150 cancer patients were included in the study (51 patients with solid tumors, 48 patients with lymphomas and 51 patients with leukemias). Amplification of PyV DNA was performed using a semi-nested version of Polymerase chain reaction targeting the T genomic region of PyV. The polyomavirus load was determined using real-time PCR assay. The clinical data were collected. Polyomavirus DNA could be detected in 84 (56%) of 150 of all cancerous patients. The solid tumors had the lowest proportion of JCV (6 (11.8%) of 51), whereas had the highest proportion of JCV (200copies/mul). JCV was more frequent among NHL patients (30%) and absent in HL patients (0%). During follow-up, PyV positivity decreased significantly (p=0.004) in lymphoma patients (n=28). Although PyV positivity decreased significantly from 39% to 7% in 28 of 48 lymphoma patients after treatment, it significantly persisted in leukemic patients after treatment (from 22% to 38%). JC was more frequent among leukemic patients with leukopenia. The presence of JC polyomavirus was more frequent among leukemic patients without any significant impact on their overall survival.",0
11091086,"Characterization and developmental expression of xSim, a Xenopus bHLH/PAS gene related to the Drosophila neurogenic master gene single-minded","We have isolated a novel gene from Xenopus, denominated xSim, which encodes a protein of 760 amino acids containing a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif contiguous to a PAS domain characteristic of an emerging family of transcriptional regulators so called bHLH/PAS. xSim shares a strong amino acid sequence identity with the Drosophila Single-minded (dSim) and with the murine Sim1 and Sim2 proteins. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that xSim gene is an ortholog gene of the mSim2 gene. Spatio-temporal analysis shows a maternal and a zygotic expression of xSim throughout early Xenopus development. In situ hybridization assays reveal that the transcripts are enriched in the animal hemisphere until blastula stage and extend to the marginal zone at early gastrula stage. As development proceeds, xSim is mainly restricted to the central nervous system.",0

The cDNA predicts a protein of 917 amino acids with a molecular weight of 98,918. Introduction of the cDNA into heterologous mammalian cells caused expression of high levels of a protein that binds dihydrotestosterone with the affinity, specificity, and sedimentation properties characteristic of the native human androgen receptor. Comparisons with the amino acid sequence of previously cloned steroid hormone receptors revealed a high degree of sequence conservation with the progesterone, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptors in the putative hormone and DNA-binding domain regions.",1

17568790,CDC25 phosphatases in cancer cells: key players? Good targets?,"Cell division cycle 25 (CDC25) phosphatases regulate key transitions between cell cycle phases during normal cell division, and in the event of DNA damage they are key targets of the checkpoint machinery that ensures genetic stability. Taking only this into consideration, it is not surprising that CDC25 overexpression has been reported in a significant number of human cancers. However, in light of the significant body of evidence detailing the stringent complexity with which CDC25 activities are regulated, the significance of CDC25 overexpression in a subset of cancers and its association with poor prognosis are proving difficult to assess. We will focus on the roles of CDC25 phosphatases in both normal and abnormal cell proliferation, provide a critical assessment of the current data on CDC25 overexpression in cancer, and discuss both current and future therapeutic strategies for targeting CDC25 activity in cancer treatment.",1

Women carriers of the E4*epsilon2 allele took longer to attain an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 6 (p = 0.015) and had more favorable ranked severity scores than noncarriers (p = 0.009). There was no association in men. Alleles epsilon3 or epsilon4 and promoter polymorphisms were not associated with disease course or severity.,1
25907736,Recurrent gain of function mutation in calcium channel CACNA1H causes early-onset hypertension with primary aldosteronism,"Many Mendelian traits are likely unrecognized owing to absence of traditional segregation patterns in families due to causation by de novo mutations, incomplete penetrance, and/or variable expressivity. Genome-level sequencing can overcome these complications. Extreme childhood phenotypes are promising candidates for new Mendelian traits. One example is early onset hypertension, a rare form of a global cause of morbidity and mortality. We performed exome sequencing of 40 unrelated subjects with hypertension due to primary aldosteronism by age 10. Five subjects (12.5%) shared the identical, previously unidentified, heterozygous CACNA1H(M1549V) mutation. Two mutations were demonstrated to be de novo events, and all mutations occurred independently. CACNA1H encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel (CaV3.2) expressed in adrenal glomerulosa. CACNA1H(M1549V) showed drastically impaired channel inactivation and activation at more hyperpolarized potentials, producing increased intracellular Ca(2+), the signal for aldosterone production. This mutation explains disease pathogenesis and provides new insight into mechanisms mediating aldosterone production and hypertension.",1
11580864,Bone morphogenetic protein-5 (BMP-5) promotes dendritic growth in cultured sympathetic neurons,"BACKGROUND: BMP-5 is expressed in the nervous system throughout development and into adulthood. However its effects on neural tissues are not well defined. BMP-5 is a member of the 60A subgroup of BMPs, other members of which have been shown to stimulate dendritic growth in central and peripheral neurons. We therefore examined the possibility that BMP-5 similarly enhances dendritic growth in cultured sympathetic neurons. RESULTS: Sympathetic neurons cultured in the absence of serum or glial cells do not form dendrites; however, addition of BMP-5 causes these neurons to extend multiple dendritic processes, which is preceded by an increase in phosphorylation of the Smad-1 transcription factor. The dendrite-promoting activity of BMP-5 is significantly inhibited by the BMP antagonists noggin and follistatin and by a BMPR-IA-Fc chimeric protein. RT-PCR and immunocytochemical analyses indicate that BMP-5 mRNA and protein are expressed in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) during times of initial growth and rapid expansion of the dendritic arbor. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a role for BMP-5 in regulating dendritic growth in sympathetic neurons. The signaling pathway that mediates the dendrite-promoting activity of BMP-5 may involve binding to BMPR-IA and activation of Smad-1, and relative levels of BMP antagonists such as noggin and follistatin may modulate BMP-5 signaling. Since BMP-5 is expressed at relatively high levels not only in the developing but also the adult nervous system, these findings suggest the possibility that BMP-5 regulates dendritic morphology not only in the developing, but also the adult nervous system.",1
1937479,Analysis of 14 cystic fibrosis mutations in five south European populations,"We have analysed five Southern European populations (Albanian, Greek, Italian, Spanish and Yugoslavian) for 14 cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations. The most frequent mutations, apart from delta F508, were G542X (6.04%), R1162X (3.61%) and N1303K (3.24%). Each of the other analysed mutations were present at a frequency of less than 1% (R347P, R334W, S549RA, S549I, G551D, R553X and W1282X), and four mutations (D110H, delta I507, S549RT, and S1255X) were not found in this sample. The data presented here allows the use of mutation analysis in 69.5% of Spanish, 58% of Greek, and 56.5% of Italian CF cases.",1
6670435,Computerized data processing in the clinical laboratory,"In order to satisfy the increasing demand for clinical chemical investigations, automatization is necessary. Computerized data processing facilitates administrative work. There are well-known fully automatized computerized systems, but they are too expensive. This paper presents our experiences with a 'hybrid' system, in which manual laboratory work is combined with computerized production of the daily list of laboratory work. The manpower needed had been decreased to one quarter, the work time from 126 minutes to 97 minutes, and the occurrence of errors from 0.72% to 0.21%. The system can be developed to produce laboratory reports, and for the continuous monitoring of data. In the case of pathological values the reports can be supplied with a warning signal and the system is suitable for the registration of laboratory statistics.",0
20063806,Mineral metabolism in a black-necked swan (Cygnus melanocoryphus) population from southern Chile,"A population of black-necked swans (Cygnus melanocoryphus) residing in a perturbed habitat revealed a low body mass, malnutrition, and hyperferremia during 2005; the swans main dietary item, Egeria densa, was lost during an environmental crisis which occurred in 2004. The objective of this study was to monitor the diet and nutritional status of this population during 2006, as well as to verify how the consumption of sediment, as part of their new diet, may explain the mineral disorders observed in these birds. Results revealed that swans increased their body mass and had an adequate protein, lipid, and iron metabolism, in spite of the fact that they maintained the same new diet (sediment and roots) during 2005-2006. In addition, transferrine saturation was indicative of the high endogenous iron load in birds which agrees with the high iron load of their environment. On the other hand, the consumption of the Cayumapu River sediment in the diet (25%) did not affect the body mass nor the nutritional and hepatic function in domestic geese over a 45-day period.",0
33081972,Explaining anaesthetic hysteresis with effect-site equilibration,"BACKGROUND: Anaesthetic induction occurs at higher plasma drug concentrations than emergence in animal studies. Some studies find evidence for such anaesthetic hysteresis in humans, whereas others do not. Traditional thinking attributes hysteresis to drug equilibration between plasma and the effect site. Indeed, a key difference between human studies showing anaesthetic hysteresis and those that do not is in how effect-site equilibration was modelled. However, the effect-site is a theoretical compartment in which drug concentration cannot be measured experimentally. Thus, it is not clear whether drug equilibration models with experimentally intractable compartments are sufficiently constrained to unequivocally establish evidence for the presence or absence of anaesthetic hysteresis. METHODS: We constructed several models. One lacked hysteresis beyond effect-site equilibration. In another, neuronal dynamics contributed to hysteresis. We attempted to distinguish between these two systems using drug equilibration models. RESULTS: Our modelling studies showed that one can always construct an effect-site equilibration model such that hysteresis collapses. So long as the concentration in the effect-site cannot be measured directly, the correct effect-site equilibration model and the one that erroneously collapses hysteresis are experimentally indistinguishable. We also found that hysteresis can naturally arise even in a simple network of neurones independently of drug equilibration. CONCLUSIONS: Effect-site equilibration models can readily collapse hysteresis. However, this does not imply that hysteresis is solely attributable to the kinetics of drug equilibration.",0

After a summary on French standards and regulations, the critical care testing perimeter and definitions of stat levels are presented in different contexts. The complete examination process is described. Guidelines are proposed for each step, to manage sub-process in a risk management approach. The following steps were studied: ordering (by specialties), sampling, transport, reception, analysis, validation and release. In summary, we proposed a list of examinations allowed to be prescribed in stat conditions with a short list and complementary tests as a function of clinical setting. These guidelines need to be adapted in clinicobiological contracts. ",0
1334557,Photoreceptors of mouse retinas possess D4 receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase,"In the mouse, the light-sensitive pool of cAMP can be eliminated in the dark by application of the dopamine D2-like receptor agonists LY 171555 (quinpirole), (+)-N0437 (2-[N-(n-propyl)-N-2-(thienylethylamino)-5-hydroxytetralin]) , or (+)-3-PPP [3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-propylpiperidine hydrochloride]. The rank-order affinity of the ability of the D2-like antagonists to block the action of LY 171555 matched that of the rat D4 receptor. Reverse transcription of retina mRNA followed by DNA amplification using D4-specific nucleotides demonstrates the presence of D4 mRNA in retina. In situ hybridization studies using D4-specific digoxygenin-labeled oligonucleotides or 35S-labeled UTP RNA probes demonstrate the presence of D4 mRNA in the photoreceptor cell layer and in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers. The modulation by D4 ligands of the dark level of light-sensitive cAMP in photoreceptors demonstrates the physiological coupling of the D4 receptor subtype.",0
26223653,CD36 Is Essential for Regulation of the Host Innate Response to Staphylococcus aureus alpha-Toxin-Mediated Dermonecrosis,"Staphylococcus aureus is the primary cause of skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs) in the United States. alpha-Hemolysin (Hla), a pore-forming toxin secreted by S. aureus and a major contributor to tissue necrosis, prompts recruitment of neutrophils critical for host defense against S. aureus infections. However, the failure to clear apoptotic neutrophils can result in damage to host tissues, suggesting that mechanisms of neutrophil clearance are essential to limiting Hla-mediated dermonecrosis. We hypothesized that CD36, a scavenger receptor which facilitates recognition of apoptosing cells, would play a significant role in regulating Hla-mediated inflammation and tissue injury during S. aureus SSSI. In this study, we show that CD36 on macrophages negatively regulates dermonecrosis caused by Hla-producing S. aureus. This regulation is independent of bacterial burden, as CD36 also limits dermonecrosis caused by intoxication with sterile bacterial supernatant or purified Hla. Dermonecrotic lesions of supernatant intoxicated CD36(-/-) mice are significantly larger, with increased neutrophil accumulation and IL-1beta expression, compared with CD36(+/+) (wild-type) mice. Neutrophil depletion of CD36(-/-) mice prevents this phenotype, demonstrating the contribution of neutrophils to tissue injury in this model. Furthermore, administration of CD36(+/+) but not CD36(-/-) macrophages near the site of intoxication reduces dermonecrosis, IL-1beta production and neutrophil accumulation to levels seen in wild-type mice. This therapeutic effect is reversed by inhibiting actin polymerization in the CD36(+/+) macrophages, supporting a mechanism of action whereby CD36-dependent macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils regulates Hla-mediated dermonecrosis. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CD36 is essential for controlling the host innate response to S. aureus skin infection.",1
11893041,"Morphologic, immunohistochemical, immunologic, ultrastructural, and time-related study of herpes simplex virus type 1-infected cultured human fibroblasts","Membrane glycoproteins of enveloped animal viruses are synthesized, processed, and transported inside infected cells. Expression of viral glycoproteins on the surface of viral particles and host cells are essential for many biologic functions. In the case of herpes simplex virus, the glycoprotein molecules may act as nucleation points for virus assembly and budding at the nuclear membrane. The temporal distribution of herpes simplex virus type 1 particles and glycoproteins in cultured human fibroblasts was studied by titration plaque assay, immunoblots, immunofluorescence light microscopy, and immunogold cryosection electron microscopy to describe the virus-cell interactions. These concordant analyses revealed significant release of infectious viral particles to the medium at 6 hours postinfection, that the capacity of the host cells to make infectious viral particles was complete at 18 hours postinfection, and that the infection brought time-related modifications of tubulin, cell morphology, and viral glycoproteins. The data presented is in accord with the theory of envelopment at the nuclear membranes containing immature glycoproteins followed by multiple deenvelopments and reenvelopments of the virus particles during the transport and maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex.",0
17142876,Is the search for alternative sources of human pluripotent stem cells a mistake?,"One response to the controversy in the United States over the moral status of the early embryo has been the proposal that scientists search for alternative sources of pluripotent stem cells. Is this a good idea? The present article argues that it is not. Following a brief look at the ethical standing of the four proposals assessed by the President's Council on Bioethics in 2005, the author addresses the fundamental question of the wisdom of pursuing alternatives to current methods of stem cell derivation. The author concludes that, given the poor prospects for finding alternatives that are both scientifically and ethically sound, and the costs of diverting energy and resources from established embryonic methods, further investment in the search for alternative methods is unwise.",0
10623591,Cloning of the beta(2a) subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel from human heart: cooperative effect of alpha(2)/delta and beta(2a) on the membrane expression of the alpha(1C) subunit,"Expression and membrane localization of an epitope-tagged human Ca(2+) channel alpha(1C) subunit were monitored in Xenopus oocytes by confocal microscopy and electrophysiological recording. When alpha(2)/delta and beta(2a) were separately coexpressed with the alpha(1C) subunit, assessment by confocal microscopy showed an 86 and 225% increase of the channel density, respectively. Simultaneous coexpression of alpha(2)/delta and beta(2a) subunits resulted in a cooperative (470%) increase. Electrophysiological measurements performed in parallel revealed that the current augmentation by the alpha(2)/delta subunit is totally attributable to an increase in channel density, whereas the beta(2a) subunit, in addition to increasing channel density, also facilitates channel opening.",1
3301739,Pulmonary and systemic contribution to canine tracheobronchial blood flow,"To investigate the quantity and pathophysiological relationship of pulmonary and bronchial artery supply to the tracheobronchial tree in dogs in absence and in presence of increased tissue metabolic requirements, pulmonary and bronchial blood flow to the trachea and bronchi was determined by the radioactive microsphere method in nine adult mongrel dogs. Microspheres were injected into the right atrium of three dogs (pulmonary injection group) and into the left ventricle of four dogs (systemic injection group) just before and three, eight and fourteen days after resection and anastomosis of the right main bronchus. The remaining two dogs served as controls without surgery. After the fourth injection, the tracheobronchial tree was harvested, divided into segments, and the radioactivity counted in each segment. At baseline the systemic flow to the tracheobronchial tree expressed as percentage of cardiac output was 0.188% +/- 0.121 and the pulmonary blood flow was 0.007% +/- 0.004 (mean +/- S.D.). Three, eight and fourteen days after transection and anastomosis of the right main stem bronchus, the systemic blood flow to the bronchial segments proximal and distal to the anastomosis increased significantly whereas pulmonary blood flow did not change. Depending on the anatomical segment considered the systemic contribution was between 5 and 100 times larger than the pulmonary one, both at baseline and after transection and anastomosis of the right main stem bronchus, but the ratio diminished in more distal segments where pulmonary blood flow was larger. It is concluded that the systemic blood contribution to the canine tracheobronchial tree is larger than the pulmonary one and that, in the presence of increased metabolic needs, it responds more promptly with increased blood flow.",0
7533278,Conjugated deferoxamine reduces blood-brain barrier disruption in experimental optic neuritis,"The purpose of this paper was to investigate the role of deferoxamine (DFO) scavenging of hydroxyl radical (.OH) on disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and demyelination in experimental optic neuritis. Eighteen strain-13 guinea pigs were sensitized for experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Nine animals received 100 mg/kg of hydroxyethyl starch-conjugated (HES) DFO by daily intraperitoneal injection commencing the day of antigenic sensitization. Nine paired litter mates received daily IP injections of HES. Serial fat-suppressed magnetic resonance imaging of the optic nerves was obtained with a T2 weighting (T2w) to evaluate demyelination and after intravascular administration of Gd-DTPA to evaluate BBB disruption. The intensity of Gd-DTPA enhancement and T2w signal of the optic nerves was quantitated 3, 7, 10 and 14 days after antigenic sensitization. Animals were then sacrificed and the optic nerves processed for light and transmission electron microscopy with ultracytochemical localization of endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and immunogold colocalization of extravasated serum albumin. The area of the optic nerve head, intensity of toluidine blue staining, and the cellular infiltrate were digitized and quantitated. Administration of HES-DFO significantly reduced the intensity of Gd-DTPA enhancement in the optic nerves of HES-DFO-treated animals compared to paired control HES animals (p = 0.0236), with the mean difference between control and treated animals of 19.39. The difference in T2w signal was not significant (p = 0.39), with a mean difference between control and treated animals of -5.51. The intensity of toluidine blue staining of optic nerve specimens was slightly less with HES-DFO compared to untreated animals (mean pair difference 2.48), and the inflammatory infiltrate was reduced with HES-DFO compared to untreated animals (mean pair difference = 61.57); these differences were not statistically significant. In the optic nerve specimens of both groups cerium perhydroxide-derived H2O2 reaction product was evident in a predominantly perivascular and perineural distribution. Immunogold-labeled serum albumin showed extravasation at foci of perivascular inflammation in both the presence and absence of H2O2-derived reaction product. Conjugated DFO reduces disruption of the BBB, as measured by Gd-DTPA enhancement, suggesting the .OH radical generated from perivascular H2O2 may play a role in alterations of vascular permeability in experimental optic neuritis.",0
9401786,"Modulation of nicotinic ACh-, GABAA- and 5-HT3-receptor functions by external H-7, a protein kinase inhibitor, in rat sensory neurones","1. The effects of external H-7, a potent protein kinase inhibitor, on the responses mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid A type (GABAA)-, nicotinic acetylcholine (nicotinic ACh)-, ionotropic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3)-, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)- and kainate (KA)-receptors were studied in freshly dissociated rat dorsal root ganglion neurone by use of whole cell patch-clamp technique. 2. External H-7 (1-1000 microM) produced a reversible, dose-dependent inhibition of whole cell currents activated by GABA, ACh and 5-HT. 3. Whole-cell currents evoked by ATP, 2-methylthio-ATP, NMDA and KA were insensitive to external H-7. 4. External H-7 shifted the dose-response curve of GABA-activated currents downward without changing the EC50 significantly (from 15.0 +/- 4.0 microM to 18.0 +/- 5.0 microM). The maximum response to GABA was depressed by 34.0 +/- 5.3%. This inhibitory action of H-7 was voltage-independent. 5. Intracellular application of H-7 (20 microM), cyclic AMP (1 mM) and BAPTA (10 mM) could not reverse the H-7 inhibition of GABA-activated currents. 6. The results suggest that external H-7 selectively and allosterically modulates the functions of GABAA-, nicotine ACh- and 5-HT3 receptors via a common conserved site in the external domain of these receptors.",0
18362360,The editing enzyme ADAR1 and the mRNA surveillance protein hUpf1 interact in the cell nucleus,"Posttranscriptional regulation is an important step in the regulation of gene expression. In this article, we show an unexpected connection between two proteins that participate in different processes of posttranscriptional regulation that ensures the production of functional mRNA molecules. Specifically, we show that the A-to-I RNA editing protein adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA 1 (ADAR1) and the human Upf1 (hUpf1) protein involved in RNA surveillance are found associated within nuclear RNA-splicing complexes. A potential functional role for this association was revealed by RNAi-mediated down-regulation of ADAR1, which was accompanied by up-regulation of a number of genes previously shown to undergo A-to-I editing in Alu repeats and to be down-regulated by hUpf1. This study suggests a regulatory pathway by a combination of ADAR1 A-to-I editing enzyme and RNA degradation presumably with the aid of hUpf1.",1

However, precise knowledge of rate-limiting enzymes and negative feedback inhibition by end-products of BIA metabolism is of paramount importance for this emerging field of synthetic biology. In this work we report the structural characterization of (S)-norcoclaurine-6-O-methyltransferase (6OMT), a key rate-limiting step enzyme involved in the synthesis of reticuline, the final intermediate to be shared between the different end-products of BIA metabolism, such as morphine, papaverine, berberine and sanguinarine. Four different crystal structures of the enzyme from Thalictrum flavum (Tf 6OMT) were solved: the apoenzyme, the complex with S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH), the complexe with SAH and the substrate and the complex with SAH and a feedback inhibitor, sanguinarine. The Tf 6OMT structural study provides a molecular understanding of its substrate specificity, active site structure and reaction mechanism. This study also clarifies the inhibition of Tf 6OMT by previously suggested feedback inhibitors. It reveals its high and time-dependent sensitivity toward sanguinarine.",0

31993967,Burden of Gastroduodenal Diseases from the Global Perspective,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We reviewed the recent medical literature to show global burden of gastroduodenal disease, potential strategies, and further perspectives. RECENT FINDINGS: Gastrointestinal and liver diseases are growing health problems, and cause more than 8 million deaths per year worldwide; encompass a range of long-term health conditions, such as digestive cancers, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, peptic ulcer disease, liver diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Scientific knowledge demonstrates that the noncommunicable disease burden can be greatly reduced if cost-effective preventive and curative actions, along with interventions for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases already available, are implemented in an effective and balanced manner. Future research will have to elaborate on simple methods for preselection of patients at high risk to allow their implementation in strategies and respect all demand of cost-effectiveness. Understanding trends in GI illnesses could be helpful to meet the needs of patients and decrease the disease burden.",0
6207099,Salivary protein polymorphism in Kenya: evidence for a new AMY1 allele,"Salivary protein polymorphism was studied in 200 schoolboys, mainly Kisii and Luo from Kenya, East Africa. The frequencies of PR, PA, DB, PB and AMY1 genes were as follows: PR*1: 0.66, PA*(+): 0.18, DB*(+): 0.55, PB*2: 0.12, AMY1*A2: 0.008, AMY1*E: 0.03. These frequencies were compared with other population data, in particular from West African and US Negroes. The most interesting finding with respect to the gene frequencies is the low PB*2 frequency and the absence of AMY1*3 in Kenya. Furthermore, a new phenotype in the AMY1 system was described which suggests the presence of an allele with an estimated frequency of 0.02.",1
7613026,Localization of the murine cholecystokinin A and B receptor genes,"We have determined the chromosomal locations of the two cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor genes in the mouse. Genetic localization utilized an interspecific backcross panel formed from the cross (C57BL/6J x Mus spretus) F1 x Mus spretus. Genomic DNAs from 94 individuals in the backcross were analyzed by Southern hybridization with rat CCKA and CCKB receptor cDNA probes. Unique map positions were determined by haplotype analysis with 650 previously mapped loci in the mouse backcross. The CCKA receptor gene (Cckar) mapped to mouse Chromosome (Chr) 5, in tight linkage with the DNA marker D5Bir8. The CCKB receptor gene (Cckbr) mapped to mouse Chr 7, tightly linked to the beta-hemoglobin locus (Hbb). This localization places Cckbr in the same region as the mouse obesity mutation tubby (tub), which also maps near Hbb (2.4 +/- 1.4 cM). Since CCK can function as a satiety factor when administered to rodents, localization of Cckbr near the tub mutation identifies this receptor as a possible candidate gene for this obesity mutation.",1
8022807,Genetic variants of human serum albumin in Italy: point mutants and a carboxyl-terminal variant,"Of the > 50 different genetic variants of human serum albumin (alloalbumins) that have been characterized by amino acid or DNA sequence analysis, almost half have been identified in Italy through a long-term electrophoretic survey of serum. Previously we have reported structural studies of 11 Italian alloalbumins with point mutations, 2 different carboxyl-terminal variants, and 1 case of analbuminemia in an Italian family. This article describes confirmation by DNA sequencing of mutations previously inferred from protein sequencing of 4 of the above alloalbumins; it also reports the mutations identified by protein and DNA sequence analysis of 4 other Italian alloalbumins not previously recorded: albumin Larino, His3-->Tyr; Tradate-2 (protein sequencing only), Lys225-->Gln; Caserta, Lys276-->Asn; and Bazzano, a carboxyl-terminal variant. The first 3 have point mutations that produce a single amino acid substitution, but a nucleotide deletion causes a frameshift and an altered and truncated carboxyl-terminal sequence in albumin Bazzano. In these 4 instances the expression of the alloalbumin is variable, ranging from 10% to 70% of the total albumiN, in contrast to the usual 50% each for the normal and mutant albumin. The distribution of point mutations in the albumin gene is nonrandom; most of the 47 reported point substitutions involve charged amino acid residues on the surface of the molecule that are not concerned with ligand-binding sites.",1
12944474,Ataxin-3 interactions with rad23 and valosin-containing protein and its associations with ubiquitin chains and the proteasome are consistent with a role in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis,"Machado-Joseph disease is caused by an expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat in the gene encoding the protein ataxin-3. We investigated if ataxin-3 was a proteasome-associated factor that recognized ubiquitinated substrates based on the rationale that (i) it is present with proteasome subunits and ubiquitin in cellular inclusions, (ii) it interacts with human Rad23, a protein that may translocate proteolytic substrates to the proteasome, and (iii) it shares regions of sequence similarity with the proteasome subunit S5a, which can recognize multiubiquitinated proteins. We report that ataxin-3 interacts with ubiquitinated proteins, can bind the proteasome, and, when the gene harbors an expanded repeat length, can interfere with the degradation of a well-characterized test substrate. Additionally, ataxin-3 associates with the ubiquitin- and proteasome-binding factors Rad23 and valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97), findings that support the hypothesis that ataxin-3 is a proteasome-associated factor that mediates the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins.",1
11122761,Treating ambulatory ischemia in coronary disease by manipulating the cell biology of atherosclerosis,"Obstructive coronary artery disease is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Our understanding of the pathobiology of coronary atherosclerosis provides us with new opportunities to reduce myocardial ischemia by interventions that address these mechanisms directly. These interventions include lipid-lowering therapies that improve local coronary vasomotion, inflammation, and the procoagulant state. These interventions have also been shown to result in important reductions in clinical events, including angina pectoris, myocardial ischemia and infarction, and death. Ambulatory electrocardiography provides a versatile and quantifiable measure of regional myocardial ischemia. Reductions in ischemia, as quantified by this diagnostic modality, are associated with improved clinical outcomes that may reflect improvements in the cellular pathophysiology of coronary atherosclerosis. This review discusses new information regarding the interactions between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the cell biology of atherosclerosis, and the activity of ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease.",0

22528521,Genetics of cholesterol efflux,"Plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) show an inverse association with coronary heart disease (CHD). As a biological trait, HDL-C is strongly genetically determined, with a heritability index ranging from 40 % to 60 %. HDL represents an appealing therapeutic target due to its beneficial pleiotropic effects in preventing CHD. This review focuses on the genetic basis of cellular cholesterol efflux, the rate-limiting step in HDL biogenesis. There are several monogenic disorders (e.g., Tangier disease, caused by mutations within ABCA1) affecting HDL biogenesis. Importantly, many disorders of cellular cholesterol homeostasis cause a reduced HDL-C. We integrate information from family studies and linkage analyses with that derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and review the recent identification of micro-RNAs (miRNA) involved in cellular cholesterol metabolism. The identification of genomic pathways related to HDL may help pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches to promote cellular cholesterol efflux as a therapeutic modality to prevent atherosclerosis.",0
11910566,Tacrolimus dosing requirements and concentrations in adult living donor liver transplant recipients,"Living donor liver transplantation in adult recipients is becoming increasingly common. The liver metabolizes most drugs, including immunosuppressive agents. Right-lobe grafts used in adult living donor liver transplantation consist of only 50% to 60% of the total liver. The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a difference between tacrolimus doses and concentrations in patients who received a partial liver transplant from a living donor (LRD) versus those who received a whole-liver transplant from a cadaveric donor (CAD). Thirteen LRD recipients and 13 CAD recipients who underwent transplantation between April 1998 and July 2000 were included in this analysis. A CAD control group matched for age, sex, and race was used for comparison. Tacrolimus doses and concentrations were analyzed weekly for the first 4 weeks, then monthly for 6 months posttransplantation. There was no difference in acute rejection rates, renal and liver function test results, or number of potentially interacting medications administered between groups. LRD recipients required significantly lower doses of tacrolimus compared with CAD recipients at 2 weeks (0.058 v 0.110 mg/kg/d; P <.01), 3 weeks (0.068 v 0.123 mg/kg/d; P <.02), 4 weeks (0.086 v 0.141 mg/kg/d; P <.02), 2 months (0.097 v 0.141 mg/kg/d; P <.03), and 3 months (0.099 v 0.138 mg/kg/d; P <.03). Tacrolimus 12-hour trough concentrations were similar between groups at all times except for 2 weeks posttransplantation, when LRD recipients' concentrations were significantly greater than those of CAD recipients (12.4 v 9.5 ng/mL; P <.03). In addition, in the first month posttransplantation, LRD recipients were more likely to have greater concentrations of tacrolimus (>15 ng/mL; 22.1% v 9.2%; P <.01). In conclusion, LRD recipients have significantly decreased tacrolimus dosing requirements compared with CAD recipients during the first 3 months posttransplantation despite having similar tacrolimus concentrations.",0
9099833,A de novo recombination in the ABO blood group gene and evidence for the occurence of recombination products,"We have encountered a paternity case where exclusion of the putative father was only observed in the ABO blood group (mother, B; child, A1; putative father, O), among the many polymorphic markers tested, including DNA fingerprints and microsatellite markers. Cloning a part of the ABO gene, PCR-amplified from the trio's genomes, followed by sequencing the cloned fragments, showed that one allele of the child had a hybrid nature, comprising exon 6 of the B allele and exon 7 of the O1 allele. Based on the evidence that exon 7 is crucial for the sugar-nucleotide specificity of A1 and B transferases and that the O1 allele is only specified by the 261G deletion in exon 6 of the consensus sequence of the A1 allele, we concluded that the hybrid allele encodes a transferase with A1 specificity, resulting, presumably, from de novo recombination between the B and O1 alleles of the mother during meiosis. Screening of random populations demonstrated the occurrence of four other hybrid alleles. Sequencing of intron VI from the five hybrid alleles showed that the junctions of the hybrid alleles were located within intron VI, the intron VI-exon 7 boundaries, or exon 7. Recombinational events seem to be partly involved in the genesis of sequence diversities of the ABO gene.",1
9783701,Localisation of a gene for non-specific X linked mental retardation (MRX46) to Xq25-q26,"We report linkage data on a new large family with non-specific X linked mental retardation (MRX), using 24 polymorphic markers covering the entire X chromosome. We could assign the underlying disease gene, denoted MRX46, to the Xq25-q26 region. MRX46 is tightly linked to the markers DXS8072, HPRT, and DXS294 with a maximum lod score of 5.12 at theta=0. Recombination events were observed with DXS425 in Xq25 and DXS984 at the Xq26-Xq27 boundary, which localises MRX46 to a 20.9 cM (12 Mb) interval. Several X linked mental retardation syndromes have been mapped to the same region of the X chromosome. In addition, the localisation of two MRX genes, MRX27 and MRX35, partially overlaps with the linkage interval obtained for MRX46. Although an extension of the linkage analysis for MRX35 showed only a minimal overlap with MRX46, it cannot be excluded that the same gene is involved in several of these MRX disorders. On the other hand, given the considerable genetic heterogeneity in MRX, one should be extremely cautious in using interfamilial linkage data to narrow down the localisation of MRX genes. Therefore, unless the underlying gene(s) is characterised by the analysis of candidate genes, MRX46 can be considered a new independent MRX locus.",1
12692518,Biallelic mutations in the CEBPA gene and low CEBPA expression levels as prognostic markers in intermediate-risk AML,"The CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha is an essential transcription factor for granulocytic differentiation. Recent studies reported N- and C-terminal CEBPA mutations in approximately 7% of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. C-terminal mutations are usually in-frame and occur in the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, resulting in deficient DNA binding. Using a rapid PCR approach, we screened for bZIP mutations and determined the prognostic value of these mutations in a cohort of 277 de novo AMLs. In addition, we set out to quantify CEBPA mRNA levels by 'real-time' PCR using TaqMan technology. In-frame insertions were observed in 12 (4.3%) cases. All cases with mutations carried an intermediate-risk karyotype and all but one belonged to M1 or M2 FAB class. Further sequence analysis revealed that CEBPA C-terminal mutations are associated with frameshift mutations in the N-terminus of CEBPA. These two mutations were always found in different alleles. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with CEBPA mutations were significantly increased (P=0.02 and 0.03, respectively) in comparison to the patients lacking these mutations. Mutations were associated with a significantly reduced hazard ratio for death (OS: HR=0.35, P=0.04) and failure (EFS: no CR, death in CR or relapse, HR=0.37, P=0.03). This favourable hazard ratio was maintained after adjustment for cytogenetic risk, FLT3-ITD and CEBPA expression levels in multivariable analysis. In contrast, low CEBPA expression in AML with intermediate-risk karyotype (n=6) seemed to be associated with poor prognosis (not significant). By including this newly developed PCR assay, we define a subgroup of good-risk patients within the heterogeneous intermediate-risk group of AML.",1
32560626,Addressing chronic persistent headaches after MTBI as a neuropathic pain state,"An increasing number of patients with chronic persistent post-traumatic headache (PPTH) after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) are being referred to headache or pain specialists as conventional treatment options for primary headache disorders have not been able to adequately alleviate their debilitating headache symptoms. Evolving clinical and mechanistic evidences support the notation that chronic persistent MTBI related headaches (MTBI-HA) carry the hallmark characteristics of neuropathic pain. Thus, in addition to conventional treatment options applicable to non-traumatic primary headache disorders, other available treatment modalities for neuropathic pain should be considered. In this comprehensive review article, the author reveals the prevalence of MTBI-HA and its clinical manifestation, discusses existing clinical and mechanistic evidence supporting the classification of chronic persistent MTBI-HA as a neuropathic pain state, and explores current available treatment options and future directions of therapeutic research related to MTBI-HA.",0

31180819,Prospective Multicenter Study on the Prognostic and Predictive Impact of Tumor Budding in Stage II Colon Cancer: Results From the SACURA Trial,"PURPOSE: The International Union Against Cancer highlighted tumor budding as a tumor-related prognostic factor. International assessment criteria for tumor budding were recently defined by the 2016 International Tumor Budding Consensus Conference (ITBCC2016). This study aimed to clarify the prognostic and predictive values of tumor budding in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the superiority of adjuvant chemotherapy with oral tegafur-uracil over surgery alone for stage II colon cancer (SACURA trial; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00392899). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2006 and 2010, we enrolled 991 patients from 123 institutions with stage II colon cancer. Tumor budding was diagnosed by central review on the basis of the criteria adopted in the ITBCC2016. We prospectively recorded all clinical and pathologic data, including the budding grade, and performed prognostic analyses after 5 years of completing the patients' registration. RESULTS: Of 991 tumors, 376, 331, and 284 were classified as BD1, BD2, and BD3, respectively; the 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate was 90.9%, 85.1%, and 74.4%, respectively (P < .001), and ranged widely in T4 tumors (86.6% to 53.3%). The budding grade significantly correlated with recurrence in the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and peritoneum (P < .001 to .01). Multivariable analysis revealed that budding and T stage exerted an independent impact on RFS, and on the basis of the Harrell concordance index, these two factors substantially contributed to the improvement of the Cox model for predicting RFS. Both the BD2 and BD3 groups demonstrated greater improvement in the 5-year recurrence rate in the adjuvant chemotherapy group than the surgery-alone group by approximately 5%, but the difference was statistically nonsignificant. CONCLUSION: Tumor budding grade on the basis of the ITBCC2016 criteria should be routinely evaluated in pathologic practice and could improve the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer.",0

21037275,"CANT1 mutation is also responsible for Desbuquois dysplasia, type 2 and Kim variant","BACKGROUND: Desbuquois dysplasia (DD) is a recessively inherited condition characterised by short stature, generalised skeletal dysplasia and advanced bone maturation. DD is both clinically and radiographically heterogeneous, and two subtypes have been distinguished based on the presence (type 1) or absence (type 2) of an accessory metacarpal bone. In addition, an apparently distinct variant without additional metacarpal bone but with short metacarpals and long phalanges (Kim variant) has been described recently. Mutations in the gene that encodes for CANT1 (calcium-activated nucleotidase 1) have been identified in a subset of patients with DD type 1. METHODS: A series of 11 subjects with DD from eight families (one type 1, two type 2, five Kim variant) were examined for CANT1 mutations by direct sequencing of all coding exons and their flanking introns. RESULTS: Eight distinct mutations were identified in seven families (one type 1, one type 2 and all 5 Kim variant): three were nonsense and five were missense. All missense mutations occurred at highly conserved amino acids in the nucleotidase conserved regions of CANT1. Measurement of nucleotidase activity in vitro showed that the missense mutations were all associated with loss-of-function. CONCLUSION: The clinical-radiographic spectrum produced by CANT1 mutations must be extended to include DD type 2 and Kim variant. While presence or absence of an additional metacarpal ossification centre has been used to distinguish subtypes of DD, this sign is not a distinctive criterion to predict the molecular basis in DD.",1

We have performed the first comprehensive mutation screen of the 10.4-kb ASPM gene, identifying all 19 mutations in a cohort of 23 consanguineous families. Mutations occurred throughout the ASPM gene and were all predicted to be protein truncating. Phenotypic variation in the 51 affected individuals occurred in the degree of microcephaly (5-11 SDs below normal) and of mental retardation (mild to severe) but appeared independent of mutation position.",1
15070970,A novel mutation in the preprovasopressin gene identified in a kindred with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus,"Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (ADNDI) is a defect in free water conservation caused by mutations in the single gene that encodes both vasopressin (VP) and its binding protein, neurophysin II (NP II). Most of the human mutations in this gene have been in the portion encoding the NP molecule; the resultant abnormal gene products are believed to cause cellular toxicity as improperly folded precursor molecules accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. We identified a new American kindred with ADNDI and found a novel mutation in the VP molecule. A 78-yr-old man was noted to have hypotonic polyuria and plasma hyperosmolarity; the urinary concentration defect was reversed by administration of VP. His symptomatology dated to childhood, and his family history was consistent with autosomal transmission of the polyuric syndrome, with affected members in three generations, including several females. Affected individuals were found to be heterozygous for a 3-bp deletion in exon 1 of arginine VP (AVP)-NP II, predicting a deletion of phenylalanine 3 (known to be critical for receptor binding) in the VP nonapeptide. Neuro 2A cells stably transfected with the mutant AVP-NP construct showed increased rates of apoptosis as assessed by flow cytometric methods. These observations support the concept that cellular toxicity of abnormal AVP-NP gene products underlies the development of ADNDI, and the data further demonstrate that mutations affecting the AVP moiety can result in initiation of these pathological processes.",1
24156052,Multi-MHz retinal OCT,"We analyze the benefits and problems of in vivo optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the human retina at A-scan rates in excess of 1 MHz, using a 1050 nm Fourier-domain mode-locked (FDML) laser. Different scanning strategies enabled by MHz OCT line rates are investigated, and a simple multi-volume data processing approach is presented. In-vivo OCT of the human ocular fundus is performed at different axial scan rates of up to 6.7 MHz. High quality non-mydriatic retinal imaging over an ultra-wide field is achieved by a combination of several key improvements compared to previous setups. For the FDML laser, long coherence lengths and 72 nm wavelength tuning range are achieved using a chirped fiber Bragg grating in a laser cavity at 419.1 kHz fundamental tuning rate. Very large data sets can be acquired with sustained data transfer from the data acquisition card to host computer memory, enabling high-quality averaging of many frames and of multiple aligned data sets. Three imaging modes are investigated: Alignment and averaging of 24 data sets at 1.68 MHz axial line rate, ultra-dense transverse sampling at 3.35 MHz line rate, and dual-beam imaging with two laser spots on the retina at an effective line rate of 6.7 MHz.

24018121,Novel GCH-1 mutations and unusual long-lasting dyskinesias in Korean families with dopa-responsive dystonia,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the long-term follow-up data of Korean patients with GTP cyclohydrolase (GTPCH) I deficient dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) with novel mutations and unusual long-lasting dyskinesias. METHODS: Clinical features and genetic testing results of GCH1 from 19 patients that included 4 families who have been followed-up for up to 25 years were analyzed. RESULTS: GCH1 mutations were confirmed in all our symptomatic subjects including 3 novel point mutations. All the subjects except for one family had typical manifestations of autosomal dominant GTPCH-I deficient DRD including early childhood onset dystonia predominantly in the legs, marked diurnal variation, intact cognition, no other systemic symptoms, and excellent sustained response to levodopa. The one family who was the exception had two gene positive members of DRD and one with dopa-unresponsive cervical dystonia with negative GCH1 mutation. One family and a sporadic case had been reported as gene negative in a previous study, but they typically had preserved dopamine transporter binding and low neopterin levels in cerebrospinal fluids; thus, GCH-1 mutation had been highly suspected, which was now confirmed by repeating the genetic testing this time. An early childhood-onset patient developed choreiform dyskinesias right after administration of levodopa. The dyskinesia had lasted for more than 4 years regardless of the levodopa dosages and then subsided while maintaining levodopa. CONCLUSION: This report emphasizes the usefulness of the neopterin level in cerebrospinal fluids and dopamine transporter imaging in the differential diagnosis of DRD syndromes and a possible mechanism of levodopa-induced-dyskinesia in early childhood onset case.",0

10378129,Effect of polyclonal immunoglobulins on neutrophil phagocytic capacity and reactive oxygen production in patients with gram-negative septicemia,"The effect of immunoglobulin (Ig) preparations on neutrophil phagocytic ability and oxidative burst in response to Escherichia coli stimulation was analyzed in 14 patients with gram-negative septicemia by an ex vivo whole blood assay using flow cytometry. In patients, neutrophils exhibited a decreased capacity to phagocytize E. coli and generate reactive oxygen products compared to healthy controls (median -68%, P < 0.01). The addition of both 7S-Ig and 19S-Ig enriched preparations in vitro resulted in a dose-dependent increase in neutrophil reactive oxygen production at concentrations of 10 g/l (median +153% and +211%, P < 0.01, respectively) and 20 g/l (median +205% and +282%, P < 0.01, respectively). A decreased neutrophil phagocytic ability was seen in patients with septicemia (median -58%) compared to healthy controls (P < 0.01). Again, the addition of 7S and 19S-Igs enhanced the phagocytic ability in a dose-dependent manner (10 g/l: median +56 and +126%; 20 g/l: median +126% and +165%, P < 0.01 for all). It can be concluded that both polyclonal Igs can increase depressed neutrophil reactive oxygen production and neutrophil phagocytosis in patients with gram-negative septicemia.",0

Its incidence is one of the highest among genetic metabolic disorders. Using a modified PCR and NcoI digestion method, we have surveyed 46 additional, unrelated MCAD-deficient patients for a prevalent mutation, an 985A-to-G transition (985A----G), that we previously identified in nine MCAD-deficient patients. Among the total of 55 studied, 44 were homozygous and 10 were heterozygous for the 985G allele, whereas one did not carry this mutant allele, indicating that the prevalence of the 985G allele is 89.1%. Furthermore, we identified five other types of mutation: one each in three of the compound heterozygotes and two in the single non-985G patient. An RFLP study of 12 985G-homozygotes showed that all 24 alleles fell into a single haplotype. A questionnaire regarding the ethnic and national origin of their patients was sent to all referring investigators. All 41 patients for whom this information was provided were Caucasians. Of 29 patients whose country of origin was specified, 19 and five were from the British Isles and Germany, respectively. These data suggest that 985A----G may have occurred in a single person in an ancient Germanic tribe.",1
1692038,"Identification of two variant short chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase alleles, each containing a different point mutation in a patient with short chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency","Two distinct mutant alleles of the precursor (p) short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) gene were identified in a SCAD-deficient patient (YH2065) using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify cDNA synthesized from total RNA from her fibroblasts. Cells from this patient had previously been shown to synthesize a labile variant SCAD in contrast to the normal stability of variant SCADs in two other SCAD-deficient cell lines (Naito, E., Y. Indo, and K. Tanaka. 1989. J. Clin. Invest. 84:1671-1674). In the present study, both mutant alleles of YH2065 were found to contain a C----T transition, one at position 136 and the other at position 319 of the coding region of pSCAD cDNA. Clones of cDNA amplified from this region showed only one of the C----T transitions, indicating that each mutation was derived from different pSCAD alleles. Each of these mutations altered a known restriction endonuclease site, and restriction analysis of additional cDNA clones from amplified mutant cDNA and Southern blotting of mutant genomic DNA confirmed the presence of two unique mutant alleles in YH2065, indicating YH2065 is a compound heterozygote.

25190354,"Expansion of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in hospitalized patients: a successful story of international clones (ST15, ST147, ST336) and epidemic plasmids (IncR, IncFIIK)","The aim of this study was to characterize by a multi-level approach extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates other than E. coli from Portuguese hospitals. Eighty-eight ESBL-producing clinical isolates (69 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 13 Enterobacter cloacae complex, 3 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Enterobacter asburiae, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Serratia marcescens) recovered from hospitals located in the North (A) or Centre (B, C) regions during two time periods (2006-7 and 2010) were analyzed. Standard methods were used for bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, ESBL characterization, clonal (PFGE, MLST) and plasmid (S1-PFGE, I-CeuI-PFGE, replicon typing, hybridization) analysis. Isolates produced mostly CTX-M-15 (47%) or SHV-12 (30%), and less frequently other SHV- (15%; SHV-2, -5, -28, -55, -106) or TEM- (9%; TEM-10, -24, -199)-types, with marked local and temporal variations. The increase of CTX-M-15 and diverse SHV ESBL-types observed in Hospital A was associated with the amplification of multidrug-resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae epidemic clones (ST15, ST147, ST336). SHV-12 and TEM-type ESBLs were mostly identified in diverse isolates of different Enterobacteriaceae species in Hospitals B and C in 2006-7. Particular plasmid types were linked to blaCTX-M-15 (IncR or non-typeable plasmids), blaSHV-12 (IncR or IncHI2), blaSHV-28/-55/-106 (IncFIIK1 or IncFIIK5), blaTEM-10 (IncL/M) or blaTEM-24 (IncA/C), mostly in epidemic clones. In our country, the amplification of CTX-M-15 and diverse SHV-type ESBL among non-E. coli Enterobacteriaceae is linked to international MDR K. pneumoniae clones (ST15, ST147, ST336) and plasmid types (IncR, IncFIIK). Furthermore, we highlight the potential of IncFIIK plasmids (here firstly associated with blaSHV-2/-28/-55/-106) to disseminate as antibiotic resistance plasmids. ",0
17319480,Dexmedetomidine to treat opioid withdrawal in infants following prolonged sedation in the pediatric ICU,"This retrospective study aims to report on the use of dexmedetomidine to treat opioid withdrawal following sedation during mechanical ventilation in a cohort of infants. Seven infants in the pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care center, ranging in age from three to 24 months (12.4 +/- 8.2 months) and in weight from 4.6 to 15.4 kgs (9.9 +/- 4.2 kgs), had received a continuous fentanyl infusion, supplemented with intermittent doses of midazolam for sedation, during mechanical ventilation. Withdrawal was documented by a Finnegan score > or = 12. Dexmedetomidine was administered as a loading dose of 0.5 microg/kg/hr, followed by an infusion of 0. 5 microg/kg/hr. Dexmedetomidine effectively controlled the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the seven patients. Subsequent Finnegan scores were < or = 7 at all times (median 4, range 1 to 7). Two patients required a repeat of the loading dose and an increase of the infusion to 0.7 microg/kg/hr. These two patients had received higher doses of fentanyl than the other five patients (8.5 +/- 0.7 versus 4.6 +/- 0.5 microg/kg/hr, p < 0.0005). No adverse hemodynamic or respiratory effects related to dexmedetomidine were noted. This report involves the largest cohort of patients to receive dexmedetomidine in the treatment of withdrawal following opioid and benzodiazepine sedation during mechanical ventilation. We conclude that dexmedetomidine offers a viable option for such issues in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting.",0
26045466,Male meiotic cytokinesis requires ceramide synthase 3-dependent sphingolipids with unique membrane anchors,"Somatic cell cytokinesis was shown to involve the insertion of sphingolipids (SLs) to midbodies prior to abscission. Spermatogenic midbodies transform into stable intercellular bridges (ICBs) connecting clonal daughter cells in a syncytium. This process requires specialized SL structures. (1) Using high resolution-mass spectrometric imaging, we show in situ a biphasic pattern of SL synthesis with testis-specific anchors. This pattern correlates with and depends on ceramide synthase 3 (CerS3) localization in both, pachytene spermatocytes until completion of meiosis and elongating spermatids. (2) Blocking the pathways to germ cell-specific ceramides (CerS3-KO) and further to glycosphingolipids (glucosylceramide synthase-KO) in mice highlights the need for special SLs for spermatid ICB stability. In contrast to somatic mitosis these SLs require ultra-long polyunsaturated anchors with unique physico-chemical properties, which can only be provided by CerS3. Loss of these anchors causes enhanced apoptosis during meiosis, formation of multinuclear giant cells and spermatogenic arrest. Hence, testis-specific SLs, which we also link to CerS3 in human testis, are quintessential for male fertility. ",1

We analyzed the anti-myeloma properties of the aza-anthracenedione pixantrone which has been successfully used in a phase III study for the treatment of patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as monotherapy as well as in combination regimes in vitro and in an adapted in vivo model (ex ovo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay). Pixantrone significantly inhibited proliferation and metabolic activity of all investigated myeloma cell lines. Importantly, anti-myeloma effects were more pronounced in tumor cell lines than in stromal cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy controls. Apoptosis of myeloma cell lines was observed only after a 7-day incubation period, indicating a fast cytostatic and a slower cytotoxic effect of this drug. Pixantrone reduced the viability of primary plasma cells of patients and induced downregulation of myeloma-cell growth in the CAM assay. Additionally, we demonstrate in vitro synergism between pixantrone and the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat with respect to its anti-proliferative features. From these data, we conclude that systematic investigations of the clinical usefulness of pixantrone in the framework of controlled clinical trials are clearly indicated (e.g., in penta-refractory patients).",0

Their impressive variation in beak morphology is associated with the exploitation of a variety of ecological niches, but its developmental basis is unknown. We performed a comparative analysis of expression patterns of various growth factors in species comprising the genus Geospiza. We found that expression of Bmp4 in the mesenchyme of the upper beaks strongly correlated with deep and broad beak morphology. When misexpressed in chicken embryos, Bmp4 caused morphological transformations paralleling the beak morphology of the large ground finch G. magnirostris.",1
12719375,New type of disease causing mutations: the example of the composite exonic regulatory elements of splicing in CFTR exon 12,"The increase in genome scanning data, derived from clinical genetics practice, is producing a wealth of information on human sequence variability. The critical issue is to identify if a given nucleotide change results in a benign polymorphism or a disease-causing mutation. We have focused on one specific gene expression step, pre-mRNA processing, where we can functionally define the effect of nucleotide changes and in turn the patient's mutation can shed light on the basic pre mRNA splicing mechanisms. Our results show that several nucleotide changes in CFTR exon 12 induce a variable extent of exon skipping that leads to reduced levels of normal transcripts. This is the case in both natural mutations D565G and G576A (the latter having previously considered a neutral polymorphism) and several site-directed silent substitutions. We demonstrate here that this phenomenon is due to the interference with a new regulatory element that we have named composite exonic regulatory element of splicing (CERES). The effect of single nucleotide substitutions at CERES cannot be predicted by neither SR matrices nor enhancer identification. The recognition and characterization of splicing abnormalities, caused by exon sequence variations at CERES elements, may represent a frequent disease-causing mechanism that also relates to the phenotypic variability. Our results indicate that even the most benign looking polymorphism in an exon cannot be ignored as it may affect the splicing process. Hence, appropriate functional splicing assays should be included in genotype screenings to distinguish between polymorphisms and pathogenic mutations.",1
468585,Registration of fibular movements in vivo in relation to the tibia at the level of the ankle joint,"Fibular movements in relation to the tibia are known on extension and dorsiflexion of the ankle-joint and have been proved by experiences on cadaveric preparates using outstanding points of relation. To registrate fibular movements in vivo a special trigonometric system has been developed permitting calculation of definite movement in frontal and sagittal plane as well as a rotation around axis. Twelve healthy volunteers were examined in this way during extension and dorsiflexion of the ankle, with and without weight-bearing. The results showed that we should not consider isolated fibular movement but analyse simultaneous complexity of movements in a graphic comparison. Under these conditions we observe a very high significance of fibular movements depending each of other. The emphasis can be designed in a field covering all the points reached by fibular movement in frontal and sagittal plane of the twelve healthy volunteers during movement of the ankle; it shows that the fibula functions like a guide-stick for ankle movement. Reflecting on the designed fields of healthy persons, some patients with posttraumatic pathological alterations of the ankle-joint have been analysed.",0

Specifically, Ir192 (74-4 day half life, 300-610 keV, and 6.0 cm. hvl in tissue) nylon ribbon and I125 (60 day half life, 27-35 keV,  and 2.0 cm. hvl in tissue) Vicryl sutures are described. A major advantage of the I125 over the Ir192 see (other than the fact that it can be permanently implanted and needs less radiation protection) is that the patient does not remain highly radioactive for as long a period due to hte extremely low I125 energy and may be allowed to leave the hospital.

8527219,The hypobetalipoproteinemias,"The fifth- and ninety-fifth-percentile concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in most Western populations are approximately 90 and 200 mg/dl, respectively. Persons with LDL cholesterol levels equal to or less than the fifth percentile are defined as having hypobetalipoproteinemia. Epidemiologic studies show that such individuals have lower-than-average risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease but higher risk for a variety of cancers, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal diseases than persons with higher levels of cholesterol. The reasons for this are not known, nor are the causes of most cases of hypobetalipoproteinemia. However, in some well-studied kindreds the hypobetalipoproteinemia phenotype is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Heterozygotes in such kindreds are usually healthy and have no difficulty absorbing dietary fat. In most kindreds, the molecular variants responsible for the hypobetalipoproteinemia are unknown, but a subset of kindreds have strong genetic linkages between the low-cholesterol phenotype and truncation-producing mutations of the apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 gene. The truncations of apoB are named according to a centile nomenclature. The full-length 4536-amino acid protein is called apoB-100, and the 25 truncations identified to date have been named apoB-2 to apoB-89. The mutations introduce premature termination codons resulting from frameshift-producing base additions or deletions. The mutations produce slowed rates of secretion of the truncated apoBs relative to the apoB-100s present in the heterozygotes. In addition, the apoB-100 molecules of the heterozygotes are also secreted at rates slower than those observed in closely matched normolipidemic controls. These physiologic results account for the hypobetalipoproteinemia of these subjects. The response of the plasma lipoproteins of heterozygotes to the manipulation of various dietary components remains to be determined. Additional low-cholesterol syndromes are autosomal recessive forms of hypobetalipoproteinemia, chylomicron retention disease, and abetalipoproteinemia. The molecular causes of the first two are unknown. Abetalipoproteinemia is an autosomal recessive condition resulting from mutations of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. All three conditions are characterized by vanishingly small concentrations of LDL, dietary fat malabsorption, and failure to thrive in infancy.",1
1840604,A single base substitution in the coding region for neurophysin II associated with familial central diabetes insipidus,"To elucidate the molecular mechanism of familial central diabetes insipidus (FDI), we sequenced the arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene in 2 patients belonging to a pedigree that is consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. 10 patients with idiopathic central diabetes insipidus (IDI) and 5 normals were also studied. The AVP-NPII gene, locating on chromosome 20, consists of three exons that encode putative signal peptide, AVP, NPII, and glycoprotein. Using polymerase chain reaction, fragments including the promoter region and all coding regions were amplified from genomic DNA and subjected to direct sequencing. Sequences of 10 patients with IDI were identical with those of normals, while in 2 patients with FDI, a single base substitution was detected in one of two alleles of the AVP-NPII gene, indicating they were heterozygotes for this mutation. It was a G----A transition at nucleotide position 1859 in the second exon, resulting in a substitution of Gly for Ser at amino acid position 57 in the NPII moiety. It was speculated that the mutated AVP-NPII precursor or the mutated NPII molecule, through their conformational changes, might be responsible for AVP deficiency.",1

25208129,Unusual multisystemic involvement and a novel BAG3 mutation revealed by NGS screening in a large cohort of myofibrillar myopathies,"BACKGROUND: Myofibrillar myopathies (MFM) are a group of phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous neuromuscular disorders, which are characterized by protein aggregations in muscle fibres and can be associated with multisystemic involvement. METHODS: We screened a large cohort of 38 index patients with MFM for mutations in the nine thus far known causative genes using Sanger and next generation sequencing (NGS). We studied the clinical and histopathological characteristics in 38 index patients and five additional relatives (n = 43) and particularly focused on the associated multisystemic symptoms. RESULTS: We identified 14 heterozygous mutations (diagnostic yield of 37%), among them the novel p.Pro209Gln mutation in the BAG3 gene, which was associated with onset in adulthood, a mild phenotype and an axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, in the absence of giant axons at the nerve biopsy. We revealed several novel clinical phenotypes and unusual multisystemic presentations with previously described mutations: hearing impairment with a FLNC mutation, dysphonia with a mutation in DES and the first patient with a FLNC mutation presenting respiratory insufficiency as the initial symptom. Moreover, we described for the first time respiratory insufficiency occurring in a patient with the p.Gly154Ser mutation in CRYAB. Interestingly, we detected a polyneuropathy in 28% of the MFM patients, including a BAG3 and a MYOT case, and hearing impairment in 13%, including one patient with a FLNC mutation and two with mutations in the DES gene. In four index patients with a mutation in one of the MFM genes, typical histological findings were only identified at the ultrastructural level (29%). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that extraskeletal symptoms frequently occur in MFM, particularly cardiac and respiratory involvement, polyneuropathy and/or deafness. BAG3 mutations should be considered even in cases with a mild phenotype or an adult onset. We identified a genetic defect in one of the known genes in less than half of the MFM patients, indicating that more causative genes are still to be found. Next generation sequencing techniques should be helpful in achieving this aim.",1
12355456,Gene copy number regulates the production of the human chemokine CCL3-L1,"Genetic variation in the chemokine system is likely to affect responses to infection, and influence the course of autoimmune and inflammatory disease. We and others have shown that the human beta-chemokine CCL3-L1, unlike its related non-allelic isoform CCL3, has high affinity for the chemokine receptors D6, CCR3 and CCR5. Moreover, CCL3-L1, but not CCL3, is susceptible to cleavage by CD26, creating a truncated -2 form with enhanced affinity for CCR1 and CCR5. Strong interaction with CCR5 means that CCL3-L1, and particularly its -2 variant, are by far the most potent natural HIV entry inhibitors described to date. Here, using real-time PCR we have shown that CCL3-L1 and a novel CCL4 isoform (termed CCL4-L1) can vary from 1-6 copies per diploid genome (pdg) in Caucasians and are occasionally completely absent. The other isoforms (CCL3 and CCL4) remain at two copies per dpg. Importantly, in a model system of pro-inflammatory chemokine production (LPS-activated monocytes)higher gene copy number correlates with an increased ratio of CCL3-L1 versus CCL3 mRNA, and enhanced chemokine production. Supernatants from samples with high copy number are able to more potently chemoattract CCR5-expressing cells, an effect blocked with anti-CCL3/CCL3-L1 antibodies. As a result of these studies, we hypothesize that genetic variation in CCL3-L1 gene copy number may affect the susceptibility to, or the progression or severity of, diseases in which this chemokine plays a role.",1
10783165,"BASC, a super complex of BRCA1-associated proteins involved in the recognition and repair of aberrant DNA structures","We report the identities of the members of a group of proteins that associate with BRCA1 to form a large complex that we have named BASC (BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex). This complex includes tumor suppressors and DNA damage repair proteins MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, ATM, BLM, and the RAD50-MRE11-NBS1 protein complex. In addition, DNA replication factor C (RFC), a protein complex that facilitates the loading of PCNA onto DNA, is also part of BASC. We find that BRCA1, the BLM helicase, and the RAD50-MRE11-NBS1 complex colocalize to large nuclear foci that contain PCNA when cells are treated with agents that interfere with DNA synthesis. The association of BRCA1 with MSH2 and MSH6, which are required for transcription-coupled repair, provides a possible explanation for the role of BRCA1 in this pathway. Strikingly, all members of this complex have roles in recognition of abnormal DNA structures or damaged DNA, suggesting that BASC may serve as a sensor for DNA damage. Several of these proteins also have roles in DNA replication-associated repair. Collectively, these results suggest that BRCA1 may function as a coordinator of multiple activities required for maintenance of genomic integrity during the process of DNA replication and point to a central role for BRCA1 in DNA repair.",1
12402266,A nonsense mutation of the MASS1 gene in a family with febrile and afebrile seizures,"A naturally occurring mutation of the mass1 (monogenic audiogenic seizure-susceptible) gene recently has been reported in the Frings mouse strain, which is prone to audiogenic seizures. The human orthologous gene, MASS1, was mapped to chromosome 5q14, for which we previously have reported significant evidence of linkage to febrile seizures (FEB4). We screened for MASS1 mutations in individuals from 48 families with familial febrile seizures and found 25 DNA alterations. None of nine missense polymorphic alleles was significantly associated with febrile seizures; however, a nonsense mutation (S2652X) causing a deletion of the C-terminal 126 amino acid residues was identified in one family with febrile and afebrile seizures. Our results suggest that a loss-of-function mutation in MASS1 might be responsible for the seizure phenotypes, though it is not likely that MASS1 contributed to the cause of febrile seizures in most of our families.",1
1400954,Comparison of four different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for serological diagnosis of Salmonella enteritidis infections in experimentally infected chickens,"The program for the eradication of Salmonella enteritidis from chickens in The Netherlands is based on bacteriological examination of breeding flocks. There is a great need for a specific and sensitive serological screening test. For that purpose, we developed four different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), i.e., an indirect ELISA with S. enteritidis flagellin, an indirect ELISA with S. enteritidis lipopolysaccharide, a double-antibody sandwich blocking ELISA that uses monoclonal antibodies against S. enteritidis flagellin (GM-DAS blocking ELISA), and a double-antibody sandwich ELISA that uses monoclonal antibodies against S. enteritidis lipopolysaccharide. In the present study, we compare the results of those ELISAs with sera from experimentally infected 1-day-old chickens and with sera and eggs from experimentally infected laying hens. Experimental infections were induced with strains of S. enteritidis phage types 1 and 2, S. typhimurium, and S. panama. Sera were collected up to days 44 and 39 after infection from 1-day-old chickens and laying hens, respectively. Only the GM-DAS blocking ELISA was able to discriminate between S. enteritidis infections and infections with the other serotypes. This ELISA had both a sensitivity and a specificity of 100% for all serum samples from experimentally infected chickens. A field study is in progress to evaluate whether this test can be implemented in the Dutch S. enteritidis eradication program.",0
8093046,The genes for the calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules P- and E-cadherin are tandemly arranged in the human genome,"Cadherins constitute a gene family of Ca(2+)-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules involved in the morphogenesis and maintenance of tissue integrity. E- and P-cadherin are members of the cadherin family that are both expressed in epithelial tissues. Here we present the localization of the human P-cadherin gene at 32 kb upstream of the human E-cadherin gene, mapping it to chromosome 16q22.1. Tandem arrangement of two cell-cell adhesion molecules from the cadherin family has also been reported in chicken. This is the first evidence for the direct linkage of two cadherins in mammals. The evolutionary conservation of the tandem arrangement of two genes encoding cell adhesion molecules suggests that the close proximity of the genes may be important for the regulation of the genes.",1
7862257,Calcium channel antagonist peptides define several components of transmitter release in the hippocampus,"The use of subtype-selective voltage-sensitive calcium channel (VSCC) antagonists has established that neurotransmitter release in mammalian brain is mediated by N-like and P-like VSCCs, and that other subtypes also contribute significantly. To determine the roles presynaptic VSCCs play in nervous system function and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of their selective inhibition, it is necessary to define further the contributions of VSCC subtypes to neurotransmitter release. The novel conopeptide, SNX-230 (omega-conopeptide MVIIC), has revealed a new VSCC subtype, the Q-type, in cerebellar granule cells. We have compared the effects of SNX-230 on release of tritiated D-aspartate ([3H]D-Asp; a non-metabolizable analog of glutamate), gamma-aminobutyric acid ([3H]GABA), and norepinephrine ([3H]NE) from rat hippocampal slices to those of the N-type VSCC blocker, SNX-111 (omega-conopeptide MVIIA), and the P-type blocker, omega-agatoxin-IVA (AgaIVA). SNX-230 blocks both [3H]D-Asp and [3H]GABA release completely, whereas AgaIVA blocks them potently but partially and SNX-111 has no effect. These results suggest that glutamate and GABA release are mediated by two VSCC subtypes, a P-type and another, perhaps Q-like. SNX-111 blocks [3H]NE release potently but partially, while SNX-230 blockade is complete, consisting of one very potent phase and one less potent phase. AgaIVA also blocks [3H]NE release potently but partially. These results suggest that at least two VSCC subtypes, an N-type and a novel non-N-type, mediate NE release. Pair-wise combinations of the three ligands indicate that at least three pharmacologically distinct components comprise [3H]NE release in the hippocampus.",0
12172543,Inhibitor of apoptosis protein survivin regulates vascular injury,"Survivin (also termed Birc5) belongs to the family of genes known as inhibitors of apoptosis, and it has been implicated in both prevention of cell death and control of mitosis. The survivin pathway is exploited in cancer, but its potential role in vascular injury is unknown. Here, we show that balloon-mediated arterial injury in rabbits resulted in expression of survivin in vascular cells. Serum or PDGF-AB stimulated survivin expression in cultured smooth-muscle cells (SMCs), which suppressed apoptosis and prevented caspase activation. Adenoviral delivery of a phosphorylation-defective survivin mutant reversed the cytoprotective effect of PDGF in SMCs without affecting mitotic progression, suppressed neointimal formation in wire-injured mouse femoral arteries, and induced vascular cell apoptosis in vivo. These data identify survivin as a critical regulator of SMC apoptosis after acute vascular injury. Disrupting the survivin pathway may provide a novel therapy to limit pathological vessel-wall remodeling.",1
18942294,Endocrine complications in transfusion dependent thalassaemia in Penang Hospital,"Frequent blood transfusions can lead to iron overload which may result in several endocrine complications especially in the absence of adequate chelation therapy. The objectives of this study are to determine the prevalence of endocrine complications in transfusion dependent thalassaemia patients and the correlation of endocrine complications with the degree of iron chelation. This retrospective study looked at cases of adult patients with transfusion dependent thalassaemia treated in the Haematology Unit, Penang Hospital. Of the 25 transfusion dependent thalassaemia patients, there were 10 male and 15 female patients respectively with almost equal number of Malay and Chinese patients (13 and 12 patients respectively). Short stature was seen in 36.0% of our patients. In our cohort, 12 patients had delayed puberty (male 70.0% and female 33.3%). Prevalence of osteoporosis was 36.0%. Hypogonadism was noted in 40.0% of males and 46.7% of females. 53.4% of the female population had menstrual abnormalities with prevalence of primary and secondary amenorrhoea at 26.7% each. The prevalence of other endocrinopathies was much lower: 8.0% had diabetes mellitus and only one patient had hypocortisolism. Iron chelation appeared insufficient in our study population. The high frequency of endocrine complications noted in our study supports the rationale for regular follow-up of transfusion dependent thalassaemic patients to ensure early detection and timely treatment of associated complications.",0
16239148,Cell-surface calreticulin initiates clearance of viable or apoptotic cells through trans-activation of LRP on the phagocyte,"Apoptotic-cell removal is critical for development, tissue homeostasis, and resolution of inflammation. Although many candidate systems exist, only phosphatidylserine has been identified as a general recognition ligand on apoptotic cells. We demonstrate here that calreticulin acts as a second general recognition ligand by binding and activating LDL-receptor-related protein (LRP) on the engulfing cell. Since surface calreticulin is also found on viable cells, a mechanism preventing inadvertent uptake was sought. Disruption of interactions between CD47 (integrin-associated protein) on the target cell and SIRPalpha (SHPS-1), a heavily glycosylated transmembrane protein on the engulfing cell, permitted uptake of viable cells in a calreticulin/LRP-dependent manner. On apoptotic cells, CD47 was altered and/or lost and no longer activated SIRPalpha. These changes on the apoptotic cell create an environment where ",1

19638443,The olfactory system of the tammar wallaby is developed at birth and directs the neonate to its mother's pouch odours,"In kangaroos and wallabies at birth the highly altricial newborn young climbs unassisted from the urogenital opening to the teat. Negative geotropism is important for the initial climb to the pouch opening, but nothing is known of the signals that then direct the neonate downwards to the teat. Here we show that the newborn tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) has the olfactory apparatus to detect smell. Both the main olfactory system and vomeronasal organ (VNO) are developed at the time of birth. Receptor cells of the main olfactory epithelium immunopositive for G(oalpha)-protein project to the three layered main olfactory bulb (MOB). The receptor epithelium of the VNO contains G-protein immunopositive cells and has olfactory knob-like structures. The VNO is connected to an area between the two MOBs. Next, using a functional test, we show that neonates can respond to odours from their mother's pouch. When neonatal young are presented with a choice of a pouch-odour-soaked swab or a saline swab, they choose the swab with their mother's pouch secretions significantly more often (P<0.05) than the saline swab. We conclude that both olfactory systems are capable of receiving odour signals at birth, a function that must be a critical adaptation for the survival of an altricial marsupial neonate such as the tammar for its journey to the pouch.",0
19337883,Pathophysiology of NSS in ADHD,"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the behavioural disorder most commonly diagnosed in childhood. In addition to the main symptoms of inattention, impulsiveness and hyperactivity, neurological soft signs (NSS) are often associated with ADHD. NSS are discrete motor and sensory disorders that cannot be linked to specific cerebral lesions. We review all the scientific contributions on NSS in ADHD. The conclusions support the presence of an alteration in the neural networks for motor control inhibition, at the base of the pathophysiology of NSS in children with ADHD, as well as a possible central role of dopamine in these neural circuits.",0

1949032,"Disposition of 2,3,7,8-tetrabromodibenzo-p-dioxin and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in the rat: biliary excretion and induction of cytochromes CYP1A1 and CYP1A2","The biologic activity and pharmacokinetic properties of 2,3,7,8-tetrabromodibenzo-p-dioxin (TBDD) are similar to those of the chlorinated congener, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Metabolism of both compounds appears to be rate-limiting for excretion, which is primarily via the feces. Therefore, the biliary elimination of TBDD and TCDD was examined as an indirect assessment of metabolism. Male F344 rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and 1 nmol/kg [3H]TBDD or [3H]TCDD was administered iv. Bile was collected for up to 8 hr while rats were maintained under anesthesia. The rate of biliary excretion of radioactivity was slightly greater for TCDD than TBDD (10% vs 7% in 5 hr). All biliary radioactivity was attributable to metabolites. High pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) profiles of biliary radioactivity were similar for [3H]TBDD and [3H]TCDD. To determine if pretreatment altered elimination kinetics, a single dose of 100 nmol/kg TBDD or TCDD was administered to rats by oral gavage 3 days prior to iv injection of 1 nmol/kg [3H]TBDD or [3H]TCDD, respectively. Biliary excretion of the radiolabeled dose was quantitatively and qualitatively unaffected by pretreatment despite a twofold increase in hepatic levels of radiolabel in the pretreated animals. Therefore, under these experimental conditions, autoinduction of TCDD and TBDD metabolism did not occur in the rat in vivo at doses which elicited enhanced hepatic uptake. In a second set of studies, the dose-response profiles for induction of cytochromes CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 by TBDD were characterized. The ED50 value for CYP1A1 induction (measured by ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity and radioimmunoassay (RIA) was estimated to be 0.8-1.0 nmol/kg, similar to what has been reported for TCDD. Induction of CYP1A2 (RIA) by TBDD appeared to be a more sensitive response over the dose range studied. Finally, comparison of hepatic CYP1A2 induction vs hepatic concentrations of TBDD 3 days following treatment with 10 vs 1 nmol/kg TBDD suggested that induction of CYP1A2 alone may not account for nonlinearities in dioxin disposition exemplified by dose-related increases in the ratio of dioxin concentrations in liver and adipose tissue.",0

15899891,"Ceramide 1-phosphate, a mediator of phagocytosis","The agonist-stimulated metabolism of membrane lipids produces potent second messengers that regulate phagocytosis. We studied whether human ceramide kinase (hCERK) activity and ceramide 1-phosphate formation could lead to enhanced phagocytosis through a mechanism involving modulation of the membrane-structural order parameter. hCERK was stably transfected into COS-1 cells that were stably transfected with the FcgammaRIIA receptor. hCERK-transfected cells displayed a significant increase in phagocytic index in association with increased ceramide kinase activation and translocation to lipid rafts after activation with opsonized erythrocytes. When challenged with opsonized erythrocytes, hCERK-transfected cells increased phagocytosis by 1.5-fold compared with vector control and simultaneously increased ceramide 1-phosphate levels 2-fold compared with vector and unstimulated control cells. Control and hCERK-transfected cells were subjected to cellular fractionation. Utilizing an antibody against hCERK, we observed that CERK translocates during activation from the cytosol to a lipid raft fraction. The plasma membrane-structural order parameter of the transfectants was measured by labeling cells with Laurdan. Cells transfected with hCERK showed a higher liquid crystalline order than control cells with stimulation, conditions that are favorable for the promotion of membrane fusion at the sites of phagocytosis. The change in the structural order parameter of the lipid rafts probably contributes to phagocytosis by promoting phagosome formation.",1
15245926,Minimally invasive therapy for renal cell carcinoma: is there a new community standard?,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate current practice use of laparoscopic and minimally invasive therapies in the treatment of renal cell cancer. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 174 members of the Minnesota Urological Society. The first case scenario described a 6-cm lesion not amenable to nephron-sparing surgery. The second case scenario described a 3-cm lower pole exophytic mass amenable to nephron-sparing surgery. The treatment options included traditional therapy (open partial or radical nephrectomy) and minimally invasive therapy (laparoscopic radical or partial nephrectomy or renal cryoablation). RESULTS: Our survey response rate was 49%. For the first scenario, 86% of respondents would offer open radical nephrectomy; however, 57% would offer laparoscopic surgery. Of those urologists offering laparoscopic surgery, 14% would refer outside their practice and 43% would use a hand-assisted approach. Sixty-four percent of the metropolitan and 56% of the urban respondents would offer a form of minimally invasive therapy; only 29% of rural respondents offered these options. For the second scenario, 90% of respondents would offer open partial nephrectomy and 45% a minimally invasive therapy; however, 24% of these would refer outside their practice. Thirty-eight percent of respondents would offer laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and 22% of respondents would offer renal cryoablation. Urologists completing residency after 1990 were more likely to offer a minimally invasive option (65%) compared with urologists completing residency before 1990 (31%). CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive therapy for renal cell cancer is evolving into a community standard of care, with urologists relying heavily on outside referrals to access minimally invasive alternatives. Younger urologists living in metropolitan and urban areas are more likely to offer minimally invasive therapy. Additional emphasis should be placed on increasing the availability of minimally invasive techniques in rural settings.",0
6615340,Tinnitus pitch and acoustic trauma,"56 Subjects complaining of tinnitus underwent an audiometric test and a test for identifying the analogous pitch of their tinnitus. All of the subjects reported that they had been exposed to noise in the past. The subjects were divided into two groups on the basis of their audiometric test results. Group P was composed of subjects who showed a sensorineural hearing loss typical of acoustic trauma. Group N was composed of subjects whose hearing was within normal limits. The pitch of the tinnitus in group P was concentrated in the high-frequency range, whereas in group N tinnitus pitch values were distributed over the low and mid-audiometric frequency spectrum. It was deduced that different processes are involved in the generation of tinnitus in the two groups.",0

METHODS: The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used to detect the EL gene promoter -384A/C genotype in 341 cases of elderly patients with ACS and 380 healthy subjects. RESULTS: In an elderly Chinese Han population, the EL-384A/C genotype and allele frequency distribution were significantly different between the ACS group and the control group (p<0.05); the frequency of the CC genotype in the ACS group was significantly higher than that in the control group (p<0.05). After adjusting for gender, age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, and other cardiovascular risk factors, the difference remains statistically significant (p<0.05). In the ACS group, C allele carriers had significantly higher serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations compared to AA genotypes (all p<0.05). CONCLUSION: EL-384A/C polymorphism was significantly associated with the ACS and lipids profile in an elderly Uygur population in Xinjiang.",0
22354168,Popeye domain containing proteins are essential for stress-mediated modulation of cardiac pacemaking in mice,"Cardiac pacemaker cells create rhythmic pulses that control heart rate; pacemaker dysfunction is a prevalent disorder in the elderly, but little is known about the underlying molecular causes. Popeye domain containing (Popdc) genes encode membrane proteins with high expression levels in cardiac myocytes and specifically in the cardiac pacemaking and conduction system. Here, we report the phenotypic analysis of mice deficient in Popdc1 or Popdc2. ECG analysis revealed severe sinus node dysfunction when freely roaming mutant animals were subjected to physical or mental stress. In both mutants, bradyarrhythmia developed in an age-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that the conserved Popeye domain functioned as a high-affinity cAMP-binding site. Popdc proteins interacted with the potassium channel TREK-1, which led to increased cell surface expression and enhanced current density, both of which were negatively modulated by cAMP. These data indicate that Popdc proteins have an important regulatory function in heart rate dynamics that is mediated, at least in part, through cAMP binding. Mice with mutant Popdc1 and Popdc2 alleles are therefore useful models for the dissection of the mechanisms causing pacemaker dysfunction and could aid in the development of strategies for therapeutic intervention.",1
2556448,High receptor binding affinity of lipoproteins in atypical dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipoproteinemia),"Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (or type III hyperlipoproteinemia) is characterized by the presence of abnormal, cholesteryl ester-rich beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) in the plasma. Subjects with typical dysbetalipoproteinemia are homozygous for an amino acid substitution in apolipoprotein (apo-) E at residue 158 and have defective apo-E-mediated binding of both pre-beta-VLDL and beta-VLDL to apo-B,E(LDL) (or LDL) receptors (1988. Chappell, D.A., J. Clin. Invest. 82:628-639). To understand the effect of substitutions in apo-E at sites other than residue 158, nine dysbetalipoproteinemic (dys-beta) subjects who were either homozygous or heterozygous for substitutions in apo-E at atypical sites were studied. These substitutions occurred at residue 142 (n = 6), 145 (n = 2), or 146 (n = 1) and are known to cause less defective binding than does the 158 substitution. The chemical composition and electrophoretic mobility of pre-beta-VLDL and beta-VLDL from atypical and typical dys-beta subjects were indistinguishable. However, lipoproteins from atypical and typical dys-beta subjects differed in their affinity for the apo-B,E(LDL) receptor on cultured human fibroblasts. The pre-beta-VLDL and beta-VLDL from atypical dys-beta subjects had 640- or 17-fold higher affinity, respectively, than did corresponding lipoproteins from typical dys-beta subjects. The higher binding affinity of lipoproteins from atypical dys-beta subjects was associated with a higher ratio of apo-E to total apo-C. Since higher binding affinity should cause more rapid receptor-mediated clearance of beta-VLDL in atypical than in typical dys-beta subjects in vivo, the mechanism of beta-VLDL accumulation may differ in these two groups.",1
31278268,Myelinating Schwann cells ensheath multiple axons in the absence of E3 ligase component Fbxw7,"In the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocytes myelinate multiple axons; in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Schwann cells (SCs) myelinate a single axon. Why are the myelinating potentials of these glia so fundamentally different? Here, we find that loss of Fbxw7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase component, enhances the myelinating potential of SCs. Fbxw7 mutant SCs make thicker myelin sheaths and sometimes appear to myelinate multiple axons in a fashion reminiscent of oligodendrocytes. Several Fbxw7 mutant phenotypes are due to dysregulation of mTOR; however, the remarkable ability of mutant SCs to ensheathe multiple axons is independent of mTOR signaling. This indicates distinct roles for Fbxw7 in SC biology including modes of axon interactions previously thought to fundamentally distinguish myelinating SCs from oligodendrocytes. Our data reveal unexpected plasticity in the myelinating potential of SCs, which may have important implications for our understanding of both PNS and CNS myelination and myelin repair.",0
19915584,Downregulation of lentivirus-mediated ILK RNAi on tractional force generation in human retinal Muller cells,"AIM: To investigate the effect of lentivirus-mediated integrin-linked kinase (ILK) RNA interference (RNAi) on human retinal Muller cells transdifferentiation into contractile myofibroblasts. METHODS: A lentiviral vector expressing ILK-specific shRNA was constructed and introduced into cultured retinal Muller cells. Silencing of the ILK gene was identified by real time RT-PCR and Western blot. The Muller cell phenotype change was confirmed by immunodetection of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) stress fiber formation. The generation of tractional force was assessed using a tissue culture assay with cells incubated in three-dimensional collagen gels; cell migration was determined by the Boyden chamber method, using 10% FBS as a chemotactic factor. RESULTS: Significant decreases in ILK mRNA and protein expression were detected in Muller cells carrying lentiviral ILK-shRNA vector. Cells treated with anti-ILK siRNA showed less alpha-SMA stress fiber formation under hypoxic conditions or cell subcultivation. Lentiviral ILK-shRNA vector transfection also significantly reduced cell migration and cell-mediated gel contraction. CONCLUSION: Lentivirus-mediated ILK RNAi decreased cell migration and contractile force generation by inhibiting alpha-SMA stress fiber formation in human retinal Muller cells. This tool might be useful to treat ocular fibroproliferative diseases associated with transdifferentiated Muller cells.",0
29211447,"Efficient Removal of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Dyes, and Heavy Metal Ions by a Homopolymer Vesicle","It is an important challenge to effectively remove environmental pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dyes, and heavy metal ions at a low cost. Herein, we present a multifunctional homopolymer vesicle self-assembled from a scalable homopolymer, poly(amic acid) (PAA), at room temperature. The vesicle can efficiently eliminate PAHs, cationic dyes, and heavy metal ions from water based on pi-pi stacking, hydrophobic effect, and electrostatic interactions with the pollutants. The residual concentrations of PAHs, cationic dyes, and heavy metal ions (such as Ni(2+)) in water are lower than 0.60 and 0.30 parts per billion (ppb) and 0.095 parts per million (ppm), respectively, representing a promising adsorbent for water remediation. Furthermore, precious metal ions such as Ag(+) can be recovered into silver nanoparticles by in situ reduction on the membrane of PAA vesicles to form a silver nanoparticle/vesicle composite (Ag@vesicle) that can effectively catalyze the reduction of toxic pollutants such as aromatic nitro-compounds and be recycled for more than ten times.",0
25115893,Rationale and design of the Pan Australasian chemotherapy-induced emesis burden of illness study,"BACKGROUND: Preventing and managing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remain important goals. The objective of the Pan Australasian chemotherapy-induced emesis burden of illness (PrACTICE) study was to describe the incidence of CINV after highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC or MEC) for cancer in current clinical practice in Australia and five Asian countries (China, India, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan). STUDY DESIGN: This prospective, observational study of CINV was conducted at 31 sites in these six countries from August 2011 through September 2012 and enrolled male and female adult patients (>/=18 years of age) naive to HEC and MEC who were scheduled to receive at least two cycles of single-day chemotherapy. The primary effectiveness endpoint was complete response, defined as no vomiting or use of rescue therapy, during chemotherapy cycle 1 in the overall phase (0-120 h), acute phase (0-24 h), and delayed phase (>24-120 h). Study outcomes were analyzed descriptively. Primary outcomes, CINV incidence, and treatment patterns (chemotherapy, CINV prophylaxis, rescue medication prescription, and rescue medication use) were assessed by phase (overall, acute, delayed), by cycle (as appropriate), within and across countries, and by level of chemotherapy emetogenicity (HEC vs. MEC). The impact of CINV in cycle 1 on CINV in cycle 2 was analyzed for all patients with evaluable data for cycle 2. No site-specific analyses were performed. The remainder of this special series of papers reports on the results of this study.",0
8732430,A new assay system detecting antibody production and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to trinitrophenyl hapten in an individual mouse,"A new assay system detecting antibody production and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to trinitrophenyl hapten in an individual mouse (AS-DAD) was established. BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with varying amounts of 2,4,6-trinitrophenylated sheep red blood cells (TNP-SRBC) on day 0. Venous blood was collected on days 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Levels of anti-TNP IgM and IgG serum were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After series of bleeding the mice were challenged with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) solution in the footpad on day 14. Footpad swelling was measured 24 or 48 h after the challenge. Peak responses of the anti-TNP IgM and IgG production were detected 4 or 6 days after the immunization with 10(9) TNP-SRBC. Maximum DTH response was also observed with 10(9) TNP-SRBC 24 h after the challenge on day 14. The antibody and DTH responses were also induced in other normal inbred strains such as C3H/He and DBA/1 but not BALB/c nu/nu mice. To evaluate AS-DAD in immunopharmacological studies, various immunomodulating agents were examined in BALB/c mice by subcutaneous administration on days 0, 1, 2 and 3. Cyclosporin or cyclophosphamide at 100 mg/kg/day completely inhibited not only the anti-TNP IgM and IgG production but also the TNP-specific DTH response. Prednisolone at 0.5 mg/kg/day had no significant effect on the IgM and IgG production, whereas it inhibited the TNP-specific DTH response. Interestingly, histamine-added mouse gamma-globulin at 150 MG/kg/day clearly enhanced the anti-TNP IgM and IgG production, while it showed a suppressive effect on the TNP-specific DTH response. Levamisole at 5.0 mg/KG/day showed suppressive effects on the anti-TNP IgG production without affecting the IgM production and the DTH response. These results suggest that AS-DAD is useful for evaluating the immunopharmacological action of various agents.",0
6422932,Human apolipoprotein A-I and C-III genes reside in the p11----q13 region of chromosome 11,"Apolipoprotein (apo) A-I is a major protein of high density lipoproteins (HDL). The gene for apoA-I has been localized to the p11 leads to q13 region of chromosome 11 by filter hybridization analysis of mouse-human hybrid cell cDNAs containing chromosome 11 translocations utilizing a cloned human apoA-I cDNA probe. The known linkage of apoA-I and apoC-III also permitted the simultaneous assignment of the apoC-III gene to the same region on chromosome 11. Comparison with previously established gene linkages on the mouse and human genome suggests that apoA-I + apoC-III may be linked to the esterase A4 and uroporphyrinogen synthase genes which are present on the long arm of human chromosome 11. The localization of the apoA-I + apoC-III genes in the p11----q13 region of chromosome 11 represents a definitive chromosomal assignment of a human apolipoprotein gene, and will now enable more detailed analysis of the geneomic organization and linkages of the apolipoprotein genes.",1
29993908,Hedging Deep Features for Visual Tracking,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been applied to visual tracking with demonstrated success in recent years. Most CNN-based trackers utilize hierarchical features extracted from a certain layer to represent the target. However, features from a certain layer are not always effective for distinguishing the target object from the backgrounds especially in the presence of complicated interfering factors (e.g., heavy occlusion, background clutter, illumination variation, and shape deformation). In this work, we propose a CNN-based tracking algorithm which hedges deep features from different CNN layers to better distinguish target objects and background clutters. Correlation filters are applied to feature maps of each CNN layer to construct a weak tracker, and all weak trackers are hedged into a strong one. For robust visual tracking, we propose a hedge method to adaptively determine weights of weak classifiers by considering both the difference between the historical as well as instantaneous performance, and the difference among all weak trackers over time. In addition, we design a Siamese network to define the loss of each weak tracker for the proposed hedge method. Extensive experiments on large benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm against the state-of-the-art tracking methods.",0

Individual differences in self-monitoring, locus of control, proactive personality, and risk aversion were examined. Results indicate that self-monitoring and risk aversion moderate the intentions-turnover link. Specifically, the relationship between turnover intentions and turnover is stronger for low self-monitors and those lower in risk aversion. Locus of control moderated the relationship in 1 of 2 samples such that the relationship was stronger for those with an internal locus of control. Proactive personality, however, did not directly moderate the relationship between intentions and turnover behaviors.",0
31494855,Characteristics of cohort studies of long-term exposure to PM2.5: a systematic review,"This study systematically reviewed all the cohort studies investigating the relationship between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and any health outcome until February 2018. We searched ISI Web of Knowledge, Pubmed, and Scopus databases for peer-reviewed journal research articles published in English. We only extracted the results of the single-pollutant main analysis of each study, excluding the effect modifications and sensitivity analyses. Out of the initial 9523 articles, 203 articles were ultimately included for analysis. Based on the different characteristics of studies such as study design, outcome, exposure assessment method, and statistical model, we calculated the number and relative frequency of analyses with statistically significant and insignificant results. Most of the studies were prospective (84.8%), assessed both genders (66.5%), and focused on a specific age range (86.8%). Most of the articles (78.1%) had used modeling techniques for exposure assessment of cohorts' participants. Among the total of 317 health outcomes, the most investigated outcomes include mortality due to cardiovascular disease (6.19%), all causes (5.48%), lung cancer (4.00%), ischemic heart disease (3.50%), and non-accidental causes (3.50%). The percentage of analyses with statistically significant results were higher among studies that used prospective design, mortality as the outcome, fixed stations as exposure assessment method, hazard ratio as risk measure, and no covariate adjustment. We can somehow conclude that the choice of right characteristics for cohort studies can make a difference in their results.",0
20577645,Early postoperative alterations of ventilation parameters after tracheostomy in major burn injuries,"PURPOSE: In patients with major burn injuries mechanical ventilation is often required for longer periods. Tracheostomy (TS) plays an integral role in airway management. We investigated the effect of TS on ventilation parameters within 8 hours after TS. MATERIALS: A retrospective analysis of severely burned patients admitted to the burn unit of a German University Hospital was performed. Ventilation parameters 8 hours before and after TS were registered. RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of 20 patients which received surgical TS was performed. Mean age was 52+/-19 years. Mean abbreviated burned severity index (ABSI) was 8.3+/-2.2. A mechanical ventilation was required for 14.3+/-4.8 days. TS was performed on day 7+/-4. Inspiratory oxygen concentration (FiO(2)) (p<0.001), peak inspiratory pressure (p<0.001), positive end-expiratory pressure (p=0.003) and pulmonary resistance (p<0.001) were reduced significantly after TS. The arterial partial pressure of oxygen/FiO(2)-ratio increased significantly after TS (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that TS reduces invasiveness of ventilation in severely burned patients and by this can optimize lung protective ventilation strategy.",0
11306709,Calcium channel alpha(2)delta subunits-structure and Gabapentin binding,"High-voltage activated calcium channels are modulated by a series of auxiliary proteins, including those of the alpha(2)delta family. Until recently, only a single alpha(2)delta subunit was known, but two further members, alpha(2)delta-2 and -3, have since been identified. In this study, the structure of these two novel subunits has been characterized and binding of the antiepileptic drug gabapentin investigated. Using antibodies directed against the amino terminal portion of the proteins, the gross structure of the subunits could be analyzed by Western blotting. Similar to alpha(2)delta-1, both alpha(2)delta-2 and -3 subunits consist of two proteins-a larger alpha(2) and a smaller delta that can be separated by reduction. The subunits are also highly N-glycosylated with approximately 30 kDa of their mass consisting of oligosaccharides. alpha(2)delta-1 was detected in all mouse tissues studied, whereas alpha(2)delta-2 was found at high levels in brain and heart. The alpha(2)delta-3 subunit was observed only in brain. alpha(2)delta-1 and alpha(2)delta-2, but not alpha(2)delta-3, were found to bind gabapentin. The K(d) value of gabapentin binding to alpha(2)delta-2 was 153 nM compared with the higher affinity binding to alpha(2)delta-1 (K(d) = 59 nM).",1
10767549,"Characterization of the recombinase activating gene-1 and 2 locus in the Japanese pufferfish, Fugu rubripes","The recombinase activating genes (RAG1 and RAG2) encode nuclear proteins that directly mediate the mechanism V(D)J recombination process that occurs in T- and B-lymphocytes. The expression of RAG1 and RAG2 is required for the proper development of maturing lymphocytes. To identify evolutionary conserved regulatory regions adjacent to both genes we isolated and sequenced a cosmid clone containing 43kb of genomic DNA of the Japanese pufferfish, Fugu rubripes. Fugu has a haploid genome of 400Mb and contains the same number of genes as the genome of higher vertebrates. With low abundance of repetitive DNA, the genome of the pufferfish has shown to be ideal for comparative genomics. We found three complete genes, RAG1, RAG2 and ACS (a possible homologue of the plant 1-aminocyclopropane-carboxylate synthase gene). There is also the 5' exon of a prohormone convertase gene, possibly PACE4. The genetic structure of both RAG1 and RAG2 is identical to that found in other fish, but the size of the intergenic region is smaller in Fugu. Expression analysis by RT-PCR shows the presence of RAG transcripts in kidney of adult Fugu. The human ACS was identified in a cosmid assigned to chromosome 11p11, which is close to the location of the RAGs (11p12). This indicates conservation of linkage between human and pufferfish.",1
18263738,BDNF is essential to promote persistence of long-term memory storage,"Persistence is a characteristic attribute of long-term memories (LTMs). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that mediate this process. We recently showed that persistence of LTM requires a late protein synthesis- and BDNF-dependent phase in the hippocampus. Here, we show that intrahippocampal delivery of BDNF reverses the deficit in memory persistence caused by inhibition of hippocampal protein synthesis. Importantly, we demonstrate that BDNF induces memory persistence by itself, transforming a nonlasting LTM trace into a persistent one in an ERK-dependent manner. Thus, BDNF is not only necessary, but sufficient to induce a late postacquisition phase in the hippocampus essential for persistence of LTM storage.",1

24932741,NF-kappaB plays a key role in microcystin-RR-induced HeLa cell proliferation and apoptosis,"Microcystins (MCs) are well-known cyanobacterial toxins produced in eutrophic waters and can act as potential carcinogens and have caused serious risk to human health. However, pleiotropic even paradoxical actions of cells exposure to MCs have been reported, and the mechanisms of MC-induced tumorigenesis and apoptosis are still unknown. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive in vitro investigation on carcinogenesis associated with nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and its downstream genes in HeLa cells (Human cervix adenocarcinoma cell line from epithelial cells) exposure to MC-RR. HeLa cells were treated with 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 microg/mL MC-RR for 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. HeLa cells presented dualistic responses to different doses of MCs. CCK8 assay showed that MC-RR exposure evidently enhanced cell viability of HeLa cells at lower MCs doses. Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis revealed that lower MCs doses promoted G1/S transition and cell proliferation while higher doses of MCs induced apoptosis, with a dose-dependent manner. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that MC-RR could increase/decrease NF-kappaB activity at lower/higher MC-RR doses, respectively. Furthermore, the expression of NF-kappaB downstream target genes including c-FLIP, cyclinD1, c-myc, and c-IAP2 showed the same variation trend as NF-kappaB activity both at mRNA and protein levels, which were induced by lower doses of MC-RR and suppressed by higher doses. Our data verified for the first time that NF-kappaB pathway may mediate MC-induced cell proliferation and apoptosis and provided a better understanding of the molecular mechanism for potential carcinogenicity of MC-RR.

20848650,Hereditary fructose intolerance: functional study of two novel ALDOB natural variants and characterization of a partial gene deletion,"Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disease caused by impaired functioning of human liver aldolase (ALDOB). At least 54 subtle/point mutations and only two large intragenic deletions have been found in the ALDOB gene. Here we report two novel ALDOB variants (p.R46W and p.Y343H) and an intragenic deletion that we found in patients with suspected HFI. The residual catalytic activity of the recombinant p.R46W and p.Y343H variants toward F1P was particularly altered. We also characterized a large intragenic deletion that we found in six unrelated patients. This is the first report of six unrelated patients sharing the same ALDOB deletion, thus indicating a founder effect for this allele in our geographic area. Because this deletion involves ALDOB exon 5, it can mimic worldwide common pathogenic genotypes, that is, homozygous p.A150P and p.A175D. Finally, the identification of only one ALDOB mutation in symptomatic patients suggests that HFI symptoms can, albeit rarely, appear also in heterozygotes. Therefore, an excessive and continuous fructose dietary intake may have deleterious effects even in apparently asymptomatic HFI carriers.",1
28582411,"Ionotropic receptors signal host recognition in the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis, Copepoda)","A remarkable feature of many parasites is a high degree of host specificity but the mechanisms behind are poorly understood. A major challenge for parasites is to identify and infect a suitable host. Many species show a high degree of host specificity, being able to survive only on one or a few related host species. To facilitate transmission, parasite's behavior and reproduction has been fine tuned to maximize the likelihood of infection of a suitable host. For some species chemical cues that trigger or attract the parasite in question have been identified but how metazoan parasites themselves receive these signals remains unknown. In the present study we show that ionotropic receptors (IRs) in the salmon louse are likely responsible for identification of a specific host. By using RNAi to knock down the expression level of different co-receptors, a significant change of infectivity and settlement of lice larvae was achieved on Atlantic salmon. More remarkably, knock down of the IRs changed the host specificity of the salmon louse and lice larvae settled at a significant rate on host that the wild type lice rejected within minutes. To our knowledge, this has never before been demonstrated for any metazoan parasite. Our results show that the parasites are able to identify the host quickly upon settlement, settle and initiate the parasitic life style if they are on the right host. This novel discovery opens up for utilizing the host recognition system for future parasite control.",0
8696942,A single nucleotide insertion in codon 317 of the CD36 gene leads to CD36 deficiency,"CD36 is a multifunctional integral-membrane glycoprotein that acts as a receptor for thrombospondin, collagen, long-chain fatty acids, and oxidized LDL. Platelet CD36 deficiency can be divided into two groups. In type I, neither platelets nor monocytes/macrophages express CD36; in type II, monocytes/macrophages express CD36 but platelets do not. Two known mutations cause CD36 deficiency, ie, a 478C-->T substitution in codon 90 (proline90-->serine) and a dinucleotide deletion at nucleotide 539 in codon 110. In this study we investigated a type I Japanese subject (A.T.) and identified a new mutation, a single nucleotide insertion at nucleotide 1159 in codon 317. This mutation leads to a frameshift and the appearance of a premature stop codon. CD36 gene analysis indicated that A.T. was a compound heterozygote for a dinucleotide deletion at nucleotide 539 and the single nucleotide insertion at nucleotide 1159. RNase protection studies suggested that the new mutation as well as the dinucleotide deletion led to a marked reduction in the level of CD36 mRNA in her macrophages. However, the new mutation could be detected in macrophage but not platelet CD36 mRNA. These data suggest that the allele having the single nucleotide insertion in this subject has an additional abnormality that results in the absence of the mutated CD36 mRNA in platelets.",1
19244361,A method for detecting and preventing negative RNA interference in preparation of lentiviral vectors for siRNA delivery,"The lentiviral vector is a useful tool for delivery of hairpin siRNA (shRNA) into mammalian cells. However, the efficiency of this system for carrying double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) has not been explored. In this study we cloned the two forms of siRNA-coding sequence, a palindromic DNA with a spacer loop for shRNA and a double-stranded DNA with opposing Pol III promoters for dsRNA, into lentiviral DNA vectors, and compared their viral vector production yields. Our results indicate that sharply lower titer vector was obtained for dsRNA while much higher titer vector was produced for shRNA, posing a fundamental concern whether siRNA-carrying viral RNA itself is an inherent target of RNAi. Further experimental analyses using packaging cells that either allow or do not allow siRNA transcription indicate that the shRNA-carrying viral RNA is resistant to RNAi but the viral RNA carrier for dsRNA is not, offering a linker of RNAi bias-target secondary structure that causes shRNA vector to evade RNAi degradation. More importantly, the poor yield of dsRNA vector production was restored when a novel packaging cell line was used that blocks the antisense strand from dsRNA duplexes. This method has important implications for the RNAi field, especially for those who are using lentiviral dsRNA and dsRNA libraries for various biological discovery and therapeutic interventions.",0
15530980,A novel approach to quantitative ultrasonic naked gene delivery and its non-invasive assessment,"The purpose of this study was to investigate practical, safe, easy-to-use, non-cytotoxic, and reliable parameters to apply to an ultrasound (US) naked gene therapy system. The ultrasound pressure at the point of cell exposure was measured using a calibrated hydrophone and the intensity calculated. An acoustic power meter calibrated using a hydrophone was used to measure the power of the transducer. Four cell types were exposed to US with different exposure times and intensities. Fluorescent microscopy, spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscope, laser scanning confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and histogram analysis were used to evaluate the results of the study. The plasmid of green fluorescent protein (GFP) served as the reporter gene. The energy accumulation E in US gene delivery for 90% cell survival was defined as the optimal parameters (E=3.56+/-0.06), and at 80% cell survival was defined as the damage threshold (E=59.67+/-3.54). US safely delivered GFP into S180 cells (35.1 kHz) at these optimal parameters without obvious damage or cytotoxity in vitro. Exposed cell function was proved normal in vivo. The transfection rate was 35.83+/-2.53% (n=6) in viable cells, corresponding to 90.17+/-1.47% (n=6) cell viability. The intensity of GFP expression showed a higher fluorescent peak in the group of adeno-associated virus GFP vector (AVV-GFP) than in the control group (P<0.001). The effect of US gene delivery and cell viability correlated as a fifth order polynomial with US intensity and exposure time. With optimal parameters, US can safely deliver naked a gene into a cell without damage to cell function. Both optimal uptake and expression of gene depend on the energy E at 90% cell survival. E can be applied as a control factor for bioeffects when combined with other parameters. Stable caviation results in optimal parameters for gene delivery and the transient caviation may cause cell damage, which will bring about a sharp rise of permeabilization. The results may be applied to the development of a novel clinical gene therapeutic system.",0
22361260,Attitudes among medical and nonmedical university students toward the survivors of childhood abuse,"OBJECTIVE: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is increasing, and current studies should address issues such as stigmas and casual attitudes that may be amenable to intervention. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of education on the attitudes of medical students toward CSA survivors. METHOD: We divided medical students into 2 groups: preclinical and clinical medical students. We compare the attitudes of nonmedical students with the attitudes of medical students with respect to survivors of CSA. All participants were asked to complete a questionnaire about stigmatization. RESULTS: There were 572 students in our study, 347 of whom were enrolled in medical school. Of the 347 medical students, 151 were from the preclinical group, and 196 were from the clinical practice group. The remainder of the participants (n = 225) were in other fields of university. Of the medical students, 68.3% responded negatively about ",0
27735016,IIem-spFRET: improved Iem-spFRET method for robust FRET measurement,"We recently developed a quantitative Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurement method based on emission-spectral unmixing (Iem-spFRET). We here developed an improved Iem-spFRET method (termed as IIem-spFRET) for more robust FRET measurement in living cells. First, two background (BG) spectral fingerprints measured from blank living cells are introduced to remove BG and autofluorescence. Second, we introduce a ? factor denoting the ratio of two molar extinction coefficient ratios (?) of acceptor to donor at two excitations into IIem-spFRET for direct measurement of the ? values using a tandem construct with unknown FRET efficiency (E). We performed IIem-spFRET on our microscope-spectrometer platform to measure the ? values of Venus (V) to Cerulean (C) and the E values of C32V, CVC, VCV, and VCVV constructs, respectively, in living Huh7 cells. For the C32V or CVC cells, the Iem-spFRET and IIem-spFRET methods measured consistent E values. However, for the cells especially with low expressing levels of VCV or VCVV, the E values measured by Iem-spFRET showed large deviations and fluctuations, whereas the IIem-spFRET method greatly improved the measured E values. Collectively, IIem-spFRET is a powerful and robust tool for quantitatively measuring FRET signal in living cells.",0
12442171,Insights into DNA recombination from the structure of a RAD51-BRCA2 complex,"The breast cancer susceptibility protein BRCA2 controls the function of RAD51, a recombinase enzyme, in pathways for DNA repair by homologous recombination. We report here the structure of a complex between an evolutionarily conserved sequence in BRCA2 (the BRC repeat) and the RecA-homology domain of RAD51. The BRC repeat mimics a motif in RAD51 that serves as an interface for oligomerization between individual RAD51 monomers, thus enabling BRCA2 to control the assembly of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, which is essential for strand-pairing reactions during DNA recombination. The RAD51 oligomerization motif is highly conserved among RecA-like recombinases, highlighting a common evolutionary origin for the mechanism of nucleoprotein filament formation, mirrored in the BRC repeat. Cancer-associated mutations that affect the BRC repeat disrupt its predicted interaction with RAD51, yielding structural insight into mechanisms for cancer susceptibility.",1
21170772,Effects of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure on markers of inflammation in female B6C3F1 mice,"Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS; 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,8-heptadecafluoro-1-octanesulfonic acid) has been reported to alter humoral immune functions, but inflammatory processes following PFOS exposure have not been fully characterized. Therefore, the current study, assessed TNF-alpha and IL-6 concentrations in serum and peritoneal lavage fluid, numbers of splenoctyes expressing intracellular TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10 or IL-1, and ex vivo TNF-alpha and IL-6 production by peritoneal macrophages following either in vivo or in vitro LPS exposure. Adult female B6C3F1 mice were exposed orally for 28 days to 0, 1, 3, or 300 mg PFOS/kg total administered dose [TAD] (e.g., 0, 0.0331, 0.0993 or 9.93 mg/kg/day). Body and spleen masses were significantly reduced in the highest PFOS treatment group compared to the control group, whereas liver mass was significantly increased. Serum TNF-alpha levels were significantly decreased following exposure to 1 mg PFOS/kg TAD as compared to controls, while serum IL-6 levels were increased. IL-6 concentrations in peritoneal lavage fluid decreased with increasing dose. PFOS treatment did not alter numbers of splenocytes expressing intracellular levels of TNF-alpha, IL-10 or IL-1. Numbers of splenocytes expressing intracellular levels of IL-6 were significantly decreased in the 3 mg/kg treatment as compared to controls. Overall, these data suggest that PFOS exposure can alter some inflammatory processes, which could potentially lead to misdirected inflammatory responses.",0
15486301,Cleavage of proBDNF by tPA/plasmin is essential for long-term hippocampal plasticity,"Long-term memory is thought to be mediated by protein synthesis-dependent, late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP). Two secretory proteins, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), have been implicated in this process, but their relationship is unclear. Here we report that tPA, by activating the extracellular protease plasmin, converts the precursor proBDNF to the mature BDNF (mBDNF), and that such conversion is critical for L-LTP expression in mouse hippocampus. Moreover, application of mBDNF is sufficient to rescue L-LTP when protein synthesis is inhibited, which suggests that mBDNF is a key protein synthesis product for L-LTP expression.",1
21180551,Do Patients with Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders have an Altered Gut Flora?,"The description of the de novo development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) following an episode of bacterial gastroenteritis (postinfectious IBS) illustrated the potential for a luminal factor (a bacterial pathogen) to cause this common gastrointestinal ailment. As a consequence of these and other observations as well as results of experiments involving animal models, the enteric flora and the immune response that it generates in the host have, somewhat surprisingly, come centre-stage in IBS research with their potential to induce the pathophysiological changes that are associated with IBS. While evidence for immune dysfunction both in the mucosa and systemically continues to accumulate, methodological limitations have hampered a full delineation of the nature of the microbiota in IBS. The latter is eagerly awaited and may yet provide a firm rationale for the use of certain probiotics and antibiotics in IBS, whose benefits have now been described with some consistency.",0
2014795,Alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase genotypes and alcoholism in Chinese men,"The liver enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which are responsible for the oxidative metabolism of ethanol, are polymorphic in humans. An allele encoding an inactive form of the mitochondrial ALDH2 is known to reduce the likelihood of alcoholism in Japanese. We hypothesized that the polymorphisms of both ALDH and ADH modify the predisposition to development of alcoholism. Therefore, we determined the genotypes of the ADH2, ADH3, and ALDH2 loci of alcoholic and nonalcoholic Chinese men living in Taiwan, using leukocyte DNA amplified by the PCR and allele-specific oligonucleotides. The alcoholics had significantly lower frequencies of the ADH2*2, ADH3*1, and ALDH2*2 alleles than did the nonalcoholics, suggesting that genetic variation in both ADH and ALDH, by modulating the rate of metabolism of ethanol and acetaldehyde, influences drinking behavior and the risk of developing alcoholism.",1

14517482,Relation between left ventricular mass and systolic blood pressure at baseline in the APTH and THOP trials,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between LV mass and systolic blood pressure at baseline was studied in the pooled database of the APTH (n = 408) and THOP (n = 376) trials. METHODS: Partial correlation coefficients were calculated between electrocardiographic and echocardiographic LV mass at baseline and different types of blood pressure, that is, office blood pressure (OBP), 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), daytime ABP and night-time ABP. RESULTS: Electrocardiographic LV mass correlated equally well (P < or = 0.001) with all types of systolic blood pressure (partial r = 0.19 to 0.22 for the Sokolow-Lyon index, 0.20 to 0.22 for the sum of the Sokolow-Lyon index plus the R-wave in aVl, and 0.12 to 0.19 for the Cornell voltage). The findings were similar for echocardiographic LV mass index (partial r = 0.15 to 0.22). However, for echocardiographic mean wall thickness, there was a stronger association with ABP than with OBP (partial r = 0.30 for 24-h ABP, 0.29 for daytime ABP, 0.26 for night-time ABP versus 0.15 for OBP (P < or = 0.05)). CONCLUSIONS In the combined dataset of the APTH and THOP trials, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic LV mass at baseline correlated significantly with all types of systolic blood pressure. For mean wall thickness, the relationship was stronger for ABP than OBP.",0

The quality of the drug after the administration of the preparation Rastin 30 DKV in the form of granules was not changed in comparison with control samples.

21504051,Toward the development of an artificial cornea: improved stability of interpenetrating polymer networks,A novel interpenetrating network (IPN) based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(acrylic acid) was developed and its use as an artificial cornea was evaluated in vivo. The in vivo results of a first set of corneal inlays based on PEG-diacrylate precursor showed inflammation of the treated eyes and haze in the corneas. The insufficient biocompatibility could be correlated to poor long-term stability of the implant caused by hydrolytic degradation over time. Adapting the hydrogel chemistry by replacing hydrolysable acrylate functionalities with stable acrylamide functionalities was shown to increase the long-term stability of the resulting IPNs under hydrolytic conditions. This new set of hydrogel implants now shows increased biocompatibility in vivo. Rabbits with corneal inlay implants are healthy and have clear cornea and non-inflamed eyes for up to 6 months after implantation.,0
3551551,A comparative study of lormetazepam and chlormethiazole in elderly in-patients,"Sixty-two elderly in-patients suffering from insomnia were studied in a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled trial. Each group received either lormetazepam 1 mg, chlormethiazole 384 mg or placebo for 7 nights. Both lormetazepam and chlormethiazole significantly increased sleep duration, reduced sleep latency and improved quality of sleep and feelings on awakening. For both drugs, reaction times the next morning were unimpaired and there was no clinical evidence of accumulation after 7 nights continuous dosing. Lormetazepam and chlormethiazole in these doses are effective and safe hypnotics for frail elderly patients.",0
9497340,Identification of a novel cytoplasmic protein that specifically binds to nuclear localization signal motifs,"Active transport of proteins into the nucleus is mediated by interaction between the classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of the targeted proteins and the NLS receptor (importin) complex. This nuclear transport system is highly regulated and conserved in eukaryotes and is essential for cell survival. Using a fragment of BRCA1 containing the two NLS motifs as a bait for yeast two-hybrid screening, we have isolated four clones, one of which is importin alpha. Here we characterize one of the other clones identified, BRAP2, which is a novel gene and expressed as a 2-kilobase mRNA in human mammary epithelial cells and some but not all tissues of mice. The isolated full-length cDNA encodes a novel protein containing 600 amino acid residues with pI 6.04. Characteristic motifs of C2H2 zinc fingers and leucine heptad repeats are present in the middle and C-terminal regions of the protein, respectively. BRAP2 also shares significant homology with a hypothetical protein from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, especially in the zinc finger region. Antibodies prepared against the C-terminal region of BRAP2 fused to glutathione S-transferase specifically recognize a cellular protein with a molecular size of 68 kDa, consistent with the size of the in vitro translated protein. Cellular BRAP2 is mainly cytoplasmic and binds to the NLS motifs of BRCA1 with similar specificity to that of importin alpha in both two-hybrid assays in yeast and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays in vitro. Other motifs such as the SV40 large T antigen NLS motif and the bipartite NLS motif found in mitosin are also recognized by BRAP2. Similarly, the yeast homolog of BRAP2 also binds to these NLS motifs in vitro. These results imply that BRAP2 may function as a cytoplasmic retention protein and play a role in regulating transport of nuclear proteins.",1
1908231,The 717Val----Ile substitution in amyloid precursor protein is associated with familial Alzheimer's disease regardless of ethnic groups,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurological disorder and the leading cause of dementia among aged individuals. The human amyloid beta protein, which is a cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is a major component of the amyloid deposited in the brain of patients with AD. By using PCR direct sequencing of exon 17 (encoding part of the beta protein) of the APP gene, we have found that a Japanese AD patient harbours a C to T substitution, responsible for a valine to isoleucine change at position 717, heterogeneously. The mutation is exactly the same as that found in a Caucasian AD family by Goate et al. (1). Furthermore, the mutation was shown to co-segregate with AD in his family. These results suggest that the Val----Ile change in the APP causes AD, regardless of ethnic background.",1
27733170,Development of a mathematical model to estimate intra-tumor oxygen concentrations through multi-parametric imaging,"BACKGROUND: Tumor hypoxia is involved in every stage of solid tumor development: formation, progression, metastasis, and apoptosis. Two types of hypoxia exist in tumors-chronic hypoxia and acute hypoxia. Recent studies indicate that the regional hypoxia kinetics is closely linked to metastasis and therapeutic responses, but regional hypoxia kinetics is hard to measure. We propose a novel approach to determine the local pO2 by fusing the parameters obtained from in vivo functional imaging through the use of a modified multivariate Krogh model. METHODS: To test our idea and its potential to translate into an in vivo setting through the use of existing imaging techniques, simulation studies were performed comparing the local partial oxygen pressure (pO2) from the proposed multivariate image fusion model to the referenced pO2 derived by Green's function, which considers the contribution from every vessel segment of an entire three-dimensional tumor vasculature to profile tumor oxygen with high spatial resolution. RESULTS: pO2 derived from our fusion approach were close to the referenced pO2 with regression slope near 1.0 and an r(2) higher than 0.8 if the voxel size (or the spatial resolution set by functional imaging modality) was less than 200 mum. The simulation also showed that the metabolic rate, blood perfusion, and hemoglobin concentration were dominant factors in tissue oxygenation. The impact of the measurement error of functional imaging to the pO2 precision and accuracy was simulated. A Gaussian error function with FWHM equal to 20 % of blood perfusion or fractional vascular volume measurement contributed to average 7 % statistical error in pO2. CONCLUSION: The simulation results indicate that the fusion of multiple parametric maps through the biophysically derived mathematical models can monitor the intra-tumor spatial variations of hypoxia in tumors with existing imaging methods, and the potential to further investigate different forms of hypoxia, such as chronic and acute hypoxia, in response to cancer therapies.",0
1904396,Nonhomologous recombination in the human genome: deletions in the human factor VIII gene,"Four deletions in the human factor VIII gene have been characterized at the sequence level in patients with hemophilia A. Deletion JH 1 extends 57 kb from IVS 10 to IVS 18. Intron 13 and exon 14 are partially deleted in patients JH 7 and JH 37, with a loss of 3.2 and 2.4 kb of DNA, respectively. The 3' deletion breakpoint of the JH 21 event resides in intron 3 and extends 5' into intron 1, resulting in the loss of exons 2 and 3. Seven of the eight breakpoints sequenced (5' and 3' for each of the four deletions) occur in nonrepetitive sequence, while the 3' breakpoint of the JH 1 resides in an Alu repetitive element. All of the deletions are the result of nonhomologous recombination. The 5' and 3' breakpoints of JH 1, JH 7, and JH 37 share 2- to 3-bp homologies at the deletion junctions. In contrast, two nucleotides have been inserted at the JH 21 deletion junction. Short sequence homologies may facilitate end-joining reactions in nonhomologous recombination events.",1

These solutions should be implemented in critical care to promote the safety of all involved in patient care.",0
28065471,Mutations in ATP6V1E1 or ATP6V1A Cause Autosomal-Recessive Cutis Laxa,"Defects of the V-type proton (H(+)) ATPase (V-ATPase) impair acidification and intracellular trafficking of membrane-enclosed compartments, including secretory granules, endosomes, and lysosomes. Whole-exome sequencing in five families affected by mild to severe cutis laxa, dysmorphic facial features, and cardiopulmonary involvement identified biallelic missense mutations in ATP6V1E1 and ATP6V1A, which encode the E1 and A subunits, respectively, of the V1 domain of the heteromultimeric V-ATPase complex. Structural modeling indicated that all substitutions affect critical residues and inter- or intrasubunit interactions. Furthermore, complexome profiling, a method combining blue-native gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, showed that they disturb either the assembly or the stability of the V-ATPase complex. Protein glycosylation was variably affected. Abnormal vesicular trafficking was evidenced by delayed retrograde transport after brefeldin A treatment and abnormal swelling and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus. In addition to showing reduced and fragmented elastic fibers, the histopathological hallmark of cutis laxa, transmission electron microscopy of the dermis also showed pronounced changes in the structure and organization of the collagen fibers. Our findings expand the clinical and molecular spectrum of metabolic cutis laxa syndromes and further link defective extracellular matrix assembly to faulty protein processing and cellular trafficking caused by genetic defects in the V-ATPase complex.",1
8155629,Bisulfite induces tandem double CC-->TT mutations in double-stranded DNA. 2. Kinetics of cytosine deamination,"Deamination of cytosine to uracil in double-stranded DNA (ds DNA) by sodium bisulfite has been monitored with a sensitive genetic assay. In this system, reversion of a mutant in the lacZ alpha gene coding sequence of bacteriophage M13mp2 C141 was detected by employing an ung- bacterial strain defective in the enzyme uracil glycosylase. Within the 4-base target, it is possible to measure the rates of induction of C-->T, C-->A, C-->G, and CC-->TT mutations in DNA that has been incubated at physiological temperature and pH and then transfected into ung+ and ung- E. coli cells, respectively, for amplification and detection of the mutation. For concentrations of bisulfite from 1 to 50 mM, the reversion frequency in ung- cells increased linearly with time of incubation. The most interesting features of the bisulfite reaction were as follow: (1) Mutations were reduced 5-fold in ung+ cells, indicating ung is involved in repair of bisulfite-treated transforming DNA. (2) Sequencing of 157 revertants revealed that C-->T and tandem CC-->TT transition mutations comprised 100% of the mutations scored. (3) A unique finding was that, at the highest concentrations and longest incubation times, almost every mutant obtained in ds DNA exposed to bisulfite was found to be a CC-->TT tandem double mutation. (4) The high frequency of tandem double mutants is inconsistent with two random, independent mutational events and, coupled with the observed ung dependence, lends support to the concept of catalytic deamination, wherein bisulfite induces deamination in contiguous cytosines by a concerted mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
7686693,A novel polymorphism in glycoprotein IV (replacement of proline-90 by serine) predominates in subjects with platelet GPIV deficiency,"To clarify the molecular basis of the deficiency of glycoprotein IV (GPIV) of the platelet surface, we analyzed GPIV cDNA synthesized from platelet RNA of five unrelated Japanese subjects whose platelets did not express GPIV. We confirmed the presence of normal-sized GPIV mRNA in platelets from subjects with GPIV deficiency. The sequence of platelet GPIV cDNA from GPIV deficient subject showed three differences when compared with the published sequence; 1) a replacement of a 478CCT codon for proline-90 by TCT for serine, 2) a four-base insertion in the 3'-noncoding region, and 3) a substitution of A for 79C in the 5'-noncoding region. The replacement of Pro90 by Ser predominates in subjects with GPIV deficiency; that is, four out of five platelets with GPIV deficiency contained GPIV mRNA encoding GPIVSer-90, while all platelets from 17 GPIV positive subjects had GPIV mRNA encoding GPIVPro-90. The sequence of platelet GPIV cDNA which did not encode GPIVSer-90 from a subject with GPIV deficiency revealed no abnormality in the coding region. The four-base insertion in the 3'-noncoding region and the substitution of A for 79C in the 5'-noncoding region seems to be unrelated to the expression of GPIV. The substitution of Ser for Pro90 might alter the GPIV structure or impair GPIV biosynthesis, resulting in a lack of detectable GPIV. This hypothesis remains to be tested.",1
10398279,Common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 do not contribute to early prostate cancer in Jewish men,"BACKGROUND: Families with a high incidence of hereditary breast cancer, and subsequently shown to have terminating mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, appear to have a higher incidence of prostate cancer among male relatives. We aimed to determine whether the common germline mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 in Ashkenazi Jewish men predisposed them to prostate cancer. METHODS: We examined genomic DNA from 83 (for BRCA1 185delAG) or 82 (for BRCA2 6174delT) Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients, most of whom were treated at a relatively young age, for the most common germline mutation in each gene seen in the Ashkenazi population. RESULTS: Our study should have been able to detect a 4-5-fold increase in the risk of prostate cancer due to mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2. However, only one (1.15%; 95% confidence interval, 0-3.6%) of the patients was heterozygous for the BRCA1 mutant allele, and only two were heterozygous for the BRCA2 mutation (2.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0-6.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of each of the germline mutations in these prostate cancer patients closely matched their incidence (about 1%) in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population. This suggests that unlike cases of breast and ovarian cancers, mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 do not significantly predispose men to prostate cancer.",1
29770809,"The effect of earthquakes on the housing market and the quality of life in the province of Groningen, the Netherlands","The Netherlands is not known for the occurrence of earthquakes. This is, however, a hot topic in the province of Groningen. Because of gas extraction, this area suffered from more than 1000 earthquakes. Most of them are not very intensive, but also bigger earthquakes of between 2 and 3 on the scale of Richter have been measured. In the last few years, thousands of houses are damaged, house prices have dropped, and the liveability is at stake. This paper pays attention to the effects of these earthquakes on the functioning of the housing market and the quality of life in the region. An extensive survey was conducted, focus groups were organized, housing market statistics were analyzed, and several econometric models were evaluated to give an answer to the question in which way the earthquakes influence the local housing market and the liveability.",0
16683919,Rab23: what exactly does it traffic?,"Rab23 is the product of the gene mutated in the mouse open brain1 phenotype, which displays neural tube defects. It appears to antagonize sonic hedgehog (Shh)-mediated signaling during mouse development, presumably by regulating the intracellular trafficking of one or more of Shh's-signaling components. The Shh receptor Patched1 (Ptch1) and its downstream effector Smoothened (Smo) were initial prime suspects as they are membrane proteins whose cellular dynamics are modulated by the Shh signal. However, Rab23 mutants do not appear to affect the localization and dynamics of either protein. Genetic analyses have now shown that Rab23 functions downstream of Smo and affects the function of the Shh-regulated Gli family of transcription factors in a more direct manner than previously thought. A plethora of proteins that influence Shh signaling and whose cellular trafficking could potentially be regulated by Rab23 has also emerged. These include members of the intraflagellar transport complex, as well as motor proteins responsible for their assembly at the cilia. Rab23 is also expressed in adult mouse neurons and may thus have functions beyond embryonic developmental stages and Shh signaling.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty seven subjects that underwent CT and renal venography, were divided into three groups based on the venographic renocaval pressure gradient (PG) and collateral veins of the left renal vein (LRV): non-compensated NCS patients with PG>/=3 mm Hg (group 1, n=12), partially compensated NCS patients with borderline PG (1<3 mm Hg) and collateral veins (group 2, n=6), and control group with low PG (0-1 mm Hg) without collateral veins (group 3, n=9). The CT findings were analyzed with regard to abrupt narrowing of the LRV with an acute angle (beak sign), aortomesenteric angle between the superior mesenteric artery and aorta on sagittal images, and LRV diameter ratio (hilar-aortomesenteric). RESULTS: Beak sign of the LRV was found in 91.7% (11/12) of group 1, 50% (3/6) of group 2, and in 11.1% (1/9) of group 3 with the significant difference between groups 1 and 3 (P<.05, chi2 test). Mean values of all quantitative CT parameters differed significantly only between groups 1 and 3 (P<.05, one-way ANOVA test). For differentiating the non-compensated NCS from the control group, the beak sign showed 91.7% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. Of the various CT parameters, the beak sign and LRV diameter ratio of >/=4.9 showed the greatest diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.903, ROC analysis). CONCLUSION: Beak sign of the LRV and CT findings can be useful in diagnosing the non-compensated NCS.",0
30089911,Exosomal PD-L1 contributes to immunosuppression and is associated with anti-PD-1 response,"Tumour cells evade immune surveillance by upregulating the surface expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which interacts with programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor on T cells to elicit the immune checkpoint response(1,2). Anti-PD-1 antibodies have shown remarkable promise in treating tumours, including metastatic melanoma(2-4). However, the patient response rate is low(4,5). A better understanding of PD-L1-mediated immune evasion is needed to predict patient response and improve treatment efficacy. Here we report that metastatic melanomas release extracellular vesicles, mostly in the form of exosomes, that carry PD-L1 on their surface. Stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) increases the amount of PD-L1 on these vesicles, which suppresses the function of CD8 T cells and facilitates tumour growth. In patients with metastatic melanoma, the level of circulating exosomal PD-L1 positively correlates with that of IFN-gamma, and varies during the course of anti-PD-1 therapy. The magnitudes of the increase in circulating exosomal PD-L1 during early stages of treatment, as an indicator of the adaptive response of the tumour cells to T cell reinvigoration, stratifies clinical responders from non-responders. Our study unveils a mechanism by which tumour cells systemically suppress the immune system, and provides a rationale for the application of exosomal PD-L1 as a predictor for anti-PD-1 therapy.",1
26997986,A three-year survey of the antimicrobial resistance of microorganisms at a Chinese hospital,"The present retrospective study aimed to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria at Shanghai First People's Hospital (Shanghai, China) between 2009 and 2011. An increasing trend of antibiotic resistance was observed in this hospital between 2009 and 2011. Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus were the most prevalent resistant strains. Antimicrobial susceptibility was detected using standard Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion and analyzed using World Health Organization software. E. coli was demonstrated to be the most prevalent bacterium in the present survey between 2009 and 2011 (16.2, 20.0 and 19.6%, respectively); followed by A. baumannii (13.5, 13.3 and 10.6%, respectively) and S. aureus. Notably, >70% of E. coli and 70% of S. aureus were resistant to common antibiotics; whereas 60% of A. baumannii and 20% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to the majority of the antibiotics investigated. In 2011, Enterococcus faecalis exhibited a resistance rate of 55.6% against levofloxacin and E. faecium exhibited a 53.2% resistance rate. The present survey demonstrated an increasing trend in bacterial resistance against antibiotics; therefore, more stringent guidelines for antibiotics should be advocated.",0

28698227,Comparative transcriptomics of hepatic differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells and adult human liver tissue,"Hepatocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-HEP) have the potential to replace presently used hepatocyte sources applied in liver disease treatment and models of drug discovery and development. Established hepatocyte differentiation protocols are effective and generate hepatocytes, which recapitulate some key features of their in vivo counterparts. However, generating mature hPSC-HEP remains a challenge. In this study, we applied transcriptomics to investigate the progress of in vitro hepatic differentiation of hPSCs at the developmental stages, definitive endoderm, hepatoblasts, early hPSC-HEP, and mature hPSC-HEP, to identify functional targets that enhance efficient hepatocyte differentiation. Using functional annotation, pathway and protein interaction network analyses, we observed the grouping of differentially expressed genes in specific clusters representing typical developmental stages of hepatic differentiation. In addition, we identified hub proteins and modules that were involved in the cell cycle process at early differentiation stages. We also identified hub proteins that differed in expression levels between hPSC-HEP and the liver tissue controls. Moreover, we identified a module of genes that were expressed at higher levels in the liver tissue samples than in the hPSC-HEP. Considering that hub proteins and modules generally are essential and have important roles in the protein-protein interactions, further investigation of these genes and their regulators may contribute to a better understanding of the differentiation process. This may suggest novel target pathways and molecules for improvement of hPSC-HEP functionality, having the potential to finally bring this technology to a wider use.",0
32185939,Endemic situation of schistosomiasis in Jiangshan City from 2008 to 2018,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the endemic situation of schistosomiasis in Jiangshan City from 2008 to 2018, so as to provide evidence for formulating the future control strategy. METHODS: The data regarding Oncomelania snail survey and control, schistosomiasis examinations and environmental improvements were collected in Jiangshan City from 2008 to 2018. The changes in snail status and morbidity due to Schistosoma japonicum infections were analyzed to assess the effectiveness of comprehensive schistosomiasis control. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2018, a total of 61 220 person-times were examined for S. japonicum infections in Jiangshan City, and the overall seroprevalence of S. japonicum infections was 0.56% (343/61 220); however, no egg-positives were detected. Among 4 231 cattle screened for S. japonicum infections using blood tests in Jiangshan City during the period from 2008 to 2018, 12 were sero-positive, with sero-prevalence of 0.28% (12/4 231), and no egg-positives were identified. There were 422 snail habitats identified in Jiangshan City during the study period, covering an area of 46.915 hm(2), and among the 31 686 snails dissected, no S. japonicum infections were detected. An area of 3 625.492 hm(2) snail habitats were subjected to repeated snail control and 11 settings were given environmental improvements, covering snail habitats of 17.880 hm(2) and historical snail habitats of 204.380 hm(2). CONCLUSIONS: Following the implementation of environmental improvements-based comprehensive schistosomiasis control, the endemic situation of schistosomiasis is stable in Jiangshan City; however, there is still a risk of snail importation and re-emerging schistosomiasis. Therefore, the monitoring of snails and morbidity due to S. japonicum infections should be intensified in the city.",0
2777253,Mapping studies of the serum cholinesterase-2 locus (CHE2),"Serum cholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase, EC 3.1.1.8, BChE) is controlled by two genetic loci, CHE1 and CHE2. The CHE1 locus has been mapped to 3q, but the map location of CHE2 is uncertain. In an effort to clarify the location of CHE2, we combined all the published linkage analysis data for CHE2 (as summarized in the Keats Linkage Database) with the data from the UCLA Linkage Database. Exclusions with substantial portions of the genome could be made (notably with portions of chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, and LG1). Although not quite statistically significant (zeta = 2.51), loose linkage (theta = 0.32) of CHE2 with the haptoglobin locus on 16q22 was the most likely conclusion from the family data. In addition, calculating the lod score between CHE2 and the available linkage map of chromosome 16 (markers HBA, PGP, FRA16A, and HP) resulted in an overall lod score of 3.2. This result is particularly intriguing given the hybridization of a BChE cDNA (designated CHEL3) to the same region. Resolution of the issue will require more detailed linkage studies of CHE2 on chromosome 16 and a better understanding of the relationship between the CHE1 and CHE2 loci with respect to production of serum cholinesterases.",1
28858373,"Electrolyte, acid-base, and hemoglobin oxygen affinity alterations following irradiation and storage of canine packed red blood cells","BACKGROUND: Irradiation of RBC before transfusion is required to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease for human patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Additional applications for irradiated blood may exist in oncologic surgery. The effect of irradiation on canine packed RBC (pRBC) is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore and characterize the in vitro electrolyte, acid-base, and oxygen-carrying capacity changes to pRBC immediately following irradiation and during storage. METHODS: Ten units of pRBC were irradiated using a linear accelerator. Concentration of potassium and glucose, percentage of free hemoglobin (fHb), hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sO2 ), total oxygen content, partial pressure of oxygen (pO2 ), the pO2 at which 50% of hemoglobin is saturated (p50), lactate, pH, and methemoglobin were measured before and following irradiation, and at 7 and 17 days post irradiation. RESULTS: In both irradiated and nonirradiated units, a significant decrease in pH and glucose, and a significant increase in lactate and potassium were noted. The pO2 , fHb, and the p50 value in both groups increased over the first 7 days. Immediately following irradiation, the pH was significantly lower, and the potassium, lactate, and fHb were significantly higher in irradiated units compared with controls. Small but significant differences were noted between irradiation status in pH, fHb, sO2 , total oxygen content, and p50 value at 7 days post irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: This hypothesis-generating study found irradiation and storage significantly altered in vitro properties of pRBC. The magnitude of these differences was small and the clinical impact of irradiation on pRBC may be negligible.",0
21035102,"Hyperchlorhidrosis caused by homozygous mutation in CA12, encoding carbonic anhydrase XII","Excessive chloride secretion in sweat (hyperchlorhidrosis), leading to a positive sweat test, is most commonly indicative of cystic fibrosis yet is found also in conjunction with various metabolic, endocrine, and dermatological disorders. There is conflicting evidence regarding the existence of autosomal-recessive hyperchlorhidrosis. We now describe a consanguineous Israeli Bedouin kindred with autosomal-recessive hyperchlohidrosis whose sole symptoms are visible salt precipitates after sweating, a preponderance to hyponatremic dehydration, and poor feeding and slow weight gain at infancy. Through genome-wide linkage analysis, we demonstrate that the phenotype is due to a homozygous mutation in CA12, encoding carbonic anhydrase XII. The mutant (c.427G>A [p.Glu143Lys]) protein showed 71% activity of the wild-type enzyme for catalyzing the CO(2) hydration to bicarbonate and H(+), and it bound the clinically used sulfonamide inhibitor acetazolamide with high affinity (K(I) of 10 nM). Unlike the wild-type enzyme, which is not inhibited by chloride, bromide, or iodide (K(I)s of 73-215 mM), the mutant is inhibited in the submicromolar range by these anions (K(I)s of 0.37-0.73 mM).",1

25058219,Use of whole-exome sequencing to determine the genetic basis of multiple mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies,"IMPORTANCE: Mitochondrial disorders have emerged as a common cause of inherited disease, but their diagnosis remains challenging. Multiple respiratory chain complex defects are particularly difficult to diagnose at the molecular level because of the massive number of nuclear genes potentially involved in intramitochondrial protein synthesis, with many not yet linked to human disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine the molecular basis of multiple respiratory chain complex deficiencies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 53 patients referred to 2 national centers in the United Kingdom and Germany between 2005 and 2012. All had biochemical evidence of multiple respiratory chain complex defects but no primary pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutation. Whole-exome sequencing was performed using 62-Mb exome enrichment, followed by variant prioritization using bioinformatic prediction tools, variant validation by Sanger sequencing, and segregation of the variant with the disease phenotype in the family. RESULTS: Presumptive causal variants were identified in 28 patients (53%; 95% CI, 39%-67%) and possible causal variants were identified in 4 (8%; 95% CI, 2%-18%). Together these accounted for 32 patients (60% 95% CI, 46%-74%) and involved 18 different genes. These included recurrent mutations in RMND1, AARS2, and MTO1, each on a haplotype background consistent with a shared founder allele, and potential novel mutations in 4 possible mitochondrial disease genes (VARS2, GARS, FLAD1, and PTCD1). Distinguishing clinical features included deafness and renal involvement associated with RMND1 and cardiomyopathy with AARS2 and MTO1. However, atypical clinical features were present in some patients, including normal liver function and Leigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) seen in association with TRMU mutations and no cardiomyopathy with founder SCO2 mutations. It was not possible to confidently identify the underlying genetic basis in 21 patients (40%; 95% CI, 26%-54%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Exome sequencing enhances the ability to identify potential nuclear gene mutations in patients with biochemically defined defects affecting multiple mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Additional study is required in independent patient populations to determine the utility of this approach in comparison with traditional diagnostic methods.",1
23144622,Identification of the first ATRIP-deficient patient and novel mutations in ATR define a clinical spectrum for ATR-ATRIP Seckel Syndrome,"A homozygous mutational change in the Ataxia-Telangiectasia and RAD3 related (ATR) gene was previously reported in two related families displaying Seckel Syndrome (SS). Here, we provide the first identification of a Seckel Syndrome patient with mutations in ATRIP, the gene encoding ATR-Interacting Protein (ATRIP), the partner protein of ATR required for ATR stability and recruitment to the site of DNA damage. The patient has compound heterozygous mutations in ATRIP resulting in reduced ATRIP and ATR expression. A nonsense mutational change in one ATRIP allele results in a C-terminal truncated protein, which impairs ATR-ATRIP interaction; the other allele is abnormally spliced. We additionally describe two further unrelated patients native to the UK with the same novel, heterozygous mutations in ATR, which cause dramatically reduced ATR expression. All patient-derived cells showed defective DNA damage responses that can be attributed to impaired ATR-ATRIP function. Seckel Syndrome is characterised by microcephaly and growth delay, features also displayed by several related disorders including Majewski (microcephalic) osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (MOPD) type II and Meier-Gorlin Syndrome (MGS). The identification of an ATRIP-deficient patient provides a novel genetic defect for Seckel Syndrome. Coupled with the identification of further ATR-deficient patients, our findings allow a spectrum of clinical features that can be ascribed to the ATR-ATRIP deficient sub-class of Seckel Syndrome. ATR-ATRIP patients are characterised by extremely severe microcephaly and growth delay, microtia (small ears), micrognathia (small and receding chin), and dental crowding. While aberrant bone development was mild in the original ATR-SS patient, some of the patients described here display skeletal abnormalities including, in one patient, small patellae, a feature characteristically observed in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome. Collectively, our analysis exposes an overlapping clinical manifestation between the disorders but allows an expanded spectrum of clinical features for ATR-ATRIP Seckel Syndrome to be defined.",1
28376994,Building emergency public information structures for response: Lessons learned from New York City,"For an effective response, emergency public information operations should be structured to facilitate the provision of timely, accurate, accessible information to the public. A frequent challenge in building a public information structure is identifying the potential staff to allow the operation to get big enough, fast enough. A plan for managing public information operations should define roles to fulfil basic functions (responding to media enquiries, writing materials, disseminating information, media and social media monitoring, community engagement and identifying and addressing rumours). This paper will offer tips for developing a plan and concept of operations for quickly assembling and maintaining public information operations. It will also describe the public information principles implemented during recent incidents in New York City, including the 2015 visit of Pope Francis to New York City. Having a coordinated, flexible model; a trained network of public information officers who are ready to staff public information roles as needed; and a structure that embeds social media into overall public information operations, will leave public information officers and their organisations more prepared to deal with the challenges and opportunities of communicating with the public during emergencies of varying types and sizes.",0
25998815,Applying meta-pathway analyses through metagenomics to identify the functional properties of the major bacterial communities of a single spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation process sample,"A high-resolution functional metagenomic analysis of a representative single sample of a Brazilian spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation process was carried out to gain insight into its bacterial community functioning. By reconstruction of microbial meta-pathways based on metagenomic data, the current knowledge about the metabolic capabilities of bacterial members involved in the cocoa bean fermentation ecosystem was extended. Functional meta-pathway analysis revealed the distribution of the metabolic pathways between the bacterial members involved. The metabolic capabilities of the lactic acid bacteria present were most associated with the heterolactic fermentation and citrate assimilation pathways. The role of Enterobacteriaceae in the conversion of substrates was shown through the use of the mixed-acid fermentation and methylglyoxal detoxification pathways. Furthermore, several other potential functional roles for Enterobacteriaceae were indicated, such as pectinolysis and citrate assimilation. Concerning acetic acid bacteria, metabolic pathways were partially reconstructed, in particular those related to responses toward stress, explaining their metabolic activities during cocoa bean fermentation processes. Further, the in-depth metagenomic analysis unveiled functionalities involved in bacterial competitiveness, such as the occurrence of CRISPRs and potential bacteriocin production. Finally, comparative analysis of the metagenomic data with bacterial genomes of cocoa bean fermentation isolates revealed the applicability of the selected strains as functional starter cultures. ",0
2898385,A third human CALC (pseudo)gene on chromosome 11,"A genomic locus in man (CALC-III) containing nucleotide sequences highly homologous to both exon 2 and exon 3 of the CALC-I and -II genes, is described in this paper. The CALC-I gene produces calcitonin (CT) (encoded by exon 4) or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (encoded by exon 5) in a tissue-specific fashion. The CALC-II gene produces a second human CGRP, but probably not a second CT. The CALC-III gene does not seem to encode a CT- or CGRP-related polypeptide hormone and is probably a pseudogene. Like the other two CALC genes, the CALC-III gene is located on human chromosome 11.",1
26260791,ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) loss of function alters Alzheimer amyloid processing,"The ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) has been identified as a susceptibility factor of late onset Alzheimer disease in genome-wide association studies. ABCA7 has been shown to mediate phagocytosis and affect membrane trafficking. The current study examined the impact of ABCA7 loss of function on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta). Suppression of endogenous ABCA7 in several different cell lines resulted in increased beta-secretase cleavage and elevated Abeta. ABCA7 knock-out mice displayed an increased production of endogenous murine amyloid Abeta42 species. Crossing ABCA7-deficient animals to an APP transgenic model resulted in significant increases in the soluble Abeta as compared with mice expressing normal levels of ABCA7. Only modest changes in the amount of insoluble Abeta and amyloid plaque densities were observed once the amyloid pathology was well developed, whereas Abeta deposition was enhanced in younger animals. In vitro studies indicated a more rapid endocytosis of APP in ABCA7 knock-out cells that is mechanistically consistent with the increased Abeta production. These in vitro and in vivo findings indicate a direct role of ABCA7 in amyloid processing that may be associated with its primary biological function to regulate endocytic pathways. Several potential loss-of-function ABCA7 mutations and deletions linked to Alzheimer disease that in some instances have a greater impact than apoE allelic variants have recently been identified. A reduction in ABCA7 expression or loss of function would be predicted to increase amyloid production and that may be a contributing factor in the associated Alzheimer disease susceptibility. ",1
22062970,Characterization of three kindreds with familial combined hypolipidemia caused by loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL3,"BACKGROUND: Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) affects lipid metabolism by inhibiting the activity of lipoprotein and endothelial lipases. Angptl3 knockout mice have marked hypolipidemia, and heterozygous carriers of ANGPLT3, loss-of-function mutations were found among individuals in the lowest quartile of plasma triglycerides in population studies. Recently, 4 related individuals with primary hypolipidemia were found to be compound heterozygotes for ANGPTL3 loss-of-function mutations. METHODS AND RESULTS: We resequenced ANGPTL3 in 4 members of 3 kindreds originally identified for very low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.97+/-0.16 and 0.56+/-0.20 mmol/L, respectively) in whom no mutations of known candidate genes for monogenic hypobetalipoproteinemia and hypoalphalipoproteinemia had been detected. These subjects were found to be homozygous or compound heterozygous for ANGPTL3 loss-of-function mutations (p.G400VfsX5, p.I19LfsX22/p.N147X) associated with the absence of ANGPTL3 in plasma. They had reduced plasma levels of triglyceride-containing lipoproteins and of HDL particles that contained only apolipoprotein A-I and pre-beta-high-density lipoprotein. In addition, their apolipoprotein B-depleted sera had a reduced capacity to promote cell cholesterol efflux through the various pathways (ABCA1-, SR-BI-, and ABCG1-mediated efflux); however, these subjects had no clinical evidence of accelerated atherosclerosis. Heterozygous carriers of the ANGPTL3 mutations had low plasma ANGPTL3 and moderately reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (2.52+/-0.38 mmol/L) but normal plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: Complete ANGPTL3 deficiency caused by loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL3 is associated with a recessive hypolipidemia characterized by a reduction of apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A-I-containing lipoproteins, changes in subclasses of high-density lipoprotein, and reduced cholesterol efflux potential of serum. Partial ANGPTL3 deficiency is associated only with a moderate reduction of low-density lipoprotein.",1

26322584,eta-Secretase processing of APP inhibits neuronal activity in the hippocampus,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques, which are predominantly composed of amyloid-beta peptide. Two principal physiological pathways either prevent or promote amyloid-beta generation from its precursor, beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), in a competitive manner. Although APP processing has been studied in great detail, unknown proteolytic events seem to hinder stoichiometric analyses of APP metabolism in vivo. Here we describe a new physiological APP processing pathway, which generates proteolytic fragments capable of inhibiting neuronal activity within the hippocampus. We identify higher molecular mass carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, termed CTF-eta, in addition to the long-known CTF-alpha and CTF-beta fragments generated by the alpha- and beta-secretases ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) and BACE1 (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1), respectively. CTF-eta generation is mediated in part by membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinases such as MT5-MMP, referred to as eta-secretase activity. eta-Secretase cleavage occurs primarily at amino acids 504-505 of APP695, releasing a truncated ectodomain. After shedding of this ectodomain, CTF-eta is further processed by ADAM10 and BACE1 to release long and short Aeta peptides (termed Aeta-alpha and Aeta-beta). CTFs produced by eta-secretase are enriched in dystrophic neurites in an AD mouse model and in human AD brains. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 activity results in robust accumulation of CTF-eta and Aeta-alpha. In mice treated with a potent BACE1 inhibitor, hippocampal long-term potentiation was reduced. Notably, when recombinant or synthetic Aeta-alpha was applied on hippocampal slices ex vivo, long-term potentiation was lowered. Furthermore, in vivo single-cell two-photon calcium imaging showed that hippocampal neuronal activity was attenuated by Aeta-alpha. These findings not only demonstrate a major functionally relevant APP processing pathway, but may also indicate potential translational relevance for therapeutic strategies targeting APP processing.

31382098,Competitive electrochemical immunosensor for maduramicin detection by multiple signal amplification strategy via hemin@Fe-MIL-88NH2/AuPt,"Maduramicin (MD) is a type of monoglycoside polyether ionophore antibiotic that can effectively treat coccidiosis and facilitate animal growth. However, its extensive and excessive use brings potential risk to human health. Herein, an electrochemical immunosensor based on indirect competitive format was fabricated for analysis of MD residue in eggs by a multiple signal amplification system. Initially, Au nanoparticles were deposited onto glassy carbon electrode surface to load the coating antigen MD-BSA and to improve conductivity. Then the signal amplification platform was constructed by encapsulating hemin into Fe-MIL-88 NH2 metal-organic frameworks (hemin@MOFs), and then the obtained composites were decorated with AuPt nanoparticles. The synthesized hemin@MOFs/AuPt was not only used as a signal amplification mediator, but also utilized as a carrier for immobilization of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated affinipure goat anti-mouse antibody (Ab2-HRP) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The constructed hemin@MOFs/AuPt-Ab2-HRP bioconjugates could effectively amplify the current signal since hemin@MOFs, AuPt and HRP all exhibited high catalytic activity towards the hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, the established immunosensor showed high sensitivity and stability during the detection procedure. With the synergistic catalytic effect of hemin@MOFs, AuPt and HRP, a wide detection range of 0.1-50ngmL(-1) and a low detection limit of 0.045ngmL(-1) were achieved (S/N=3), respectively. Ultimately, the developed method displayed excellent performance in practical applications, providing a promising probability to detect other veterinary drug residues to guarantee food safety.",0

2171342,The use of in situ hybridization to show human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in metastatic cancer cells within lymph nodes,"Southern blot hybridization has been used to identify human papillomavirus types in both primary tumors and lymph node metastases. However, this technique requires fresh-frozen tissue and is incapable of localizing deoxyribonucleic acid sequences to specific cell types in the tumor sample. In contrast, in situ hybridization precisely locates viral sequences within tumor cells while preserving cellular architecture. Further, in situ hybridization requires only small samples of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Five lymph nodes (from four patients) containing metastatic cervical squamous tumor cells (identified with hematoxylin and eosinophil staining) were analyzed with in situ hybridization techniques with human papillomavirus type 16 deoxyribonucleic acid probes labeled with sulfur 35. The primary cervical cancer from all four patients had been shown to contain human papillomavirus type 16 sequences by Southern blot. Three specimens from two patients clearly showed the presence of human papillomavirus type 16 sequences within the nuclei of metastatic tumor cells, whereas two specimens were nondiagnostic most likely as a result of the small volume of cancer relative to the size of the lymph node. This information indicates that it is the tumor cells themselves that contain viral deoxyribonucleic acid and provides additional evidence linking human papillomavirus with cervical carcinogenesis.",0

Distribution at the dermal-epidermal junction,"Chronic sun exposure results in photoaged skin with deep coarse wrinkles and loss of elasticity. We have examined the distribution and abundance of fibrillin-rich microfibrils, key structural components of the elastic fiber network, in photoaged and photoprotected skin. Punch biopsies taken from photoaged forearm and from photoprotected hip and upper inner arm of 16 subjects with a clinical range of photoaging were examined for fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 expression and microfibril distribution. In situ hybridization revealed decreased fibrillin-1 mRNA but unchanged fibrillin-2 mRNA levels in severely photoaged forearm biopsies relative to photoprotected dermal sites. An immunohistochemical approach demonstrated that microfibrils at the dermal-epidermal junction were significantly reduced in moderate to severely photoaged forearm skin. Confocal microscopy revealed that the papillary dermal microfibrillar network was truncated and depleted in photoaged skin. These studies highlight that the fibrillin-rich microfibrillar network associated with the upper dermis undergoes extensive remodeling following solar irradiation. These changes may contribute to the clinical features of photoaging, such as wrinkle formation and loss of elasticity.",0
8432534,Localization of human cell cycle regulatory genes CDC25C to 5q31 and WEE1 to 11p15.3-11p15.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization,"The cell cycle control genes are highly conserved during evolution since they play a key role in the regulation of cell division. We have localized CDC25C and WEE1 respectively at 5q31 and 11p15.3-11p15.1 using fluorescent in situ hybridization of cDNA probes on human chromosomes. This shows that genes acting through a regulatory phosphorylation cascade are not clustered on the same chromosome. Furthermore, they appear to map on chromosomal regions involved in tumorigenesis. The 5q23-q31 region of chromosome 5 is deleted in some hematologic disorders, and the p15 region of chromosome 11 is involved in development of embryonic tumors.",1
19914819,Saccade control after V1 lesion revisited,"A number of previous articles on blindsight have stressed that even after the lesion of the primary visual cortex (V1), subjects can perform visually guided saccades toward the targets in the blind field and that the extrageniculate visual pathway which bypasses the V1 can control the saccades by itself. However, in monkey model of V1 lesion, about two months of time is needed for recovery, suggesting that the extrageniculate visual pathway cannot immediately take over the function of the geniculo-striatal pathway, and on close look at the dynamics of saccades, saccades became ballistic and online corrections of trajectories and velocities were impaired, and that decision threshold for saccade initiation was lowered. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the visual signal through V1 is necessary for deliberate control of saccades.",0

To determine the molecular basis of the phenotypic diversity in AIS, we have studied 27 subjects (13 CAIS, 14 PAIS), spanning the full range of AIS phenotypes. We report the results of a mutation screen of the androgen receptor gene. The coding regions of the gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and screened for single strand conformation polymorphisms to identify mutations. This was followed by DNA sequencing of putative mutant segments. Androgen receptor gene mutations were identified in nine CAIS and five PAIS subjects. Two of the CAIS mutations in exon A resulted in frameshifts. A third CAIS mutation resulted in the deletion of a single amino acid from the ligand binding domain of the receptor. All other mutations caused single amino acid substitutions in the ligand binding domain. These results suggest that mutations affecting the ligand binding domain of the androgen receptor are the most frequent cause of AIS, although some cases of PAIS may be the result of other, as yet undefined, genetic lesions.",1
32615346,Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the elderly,"BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating the role of long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) development showed inconsistent results and were limited to Western countries. We aimed to determine the association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and COPD development in metropolitan cities in Korea, which have higher PM2.5 levels than those in Western country studies. METHODS: We constructed a retrospective cohort (elderly aged over 65 years who resided in 7 metropolitan cities in 2008) using Korea health insurance data. A total of 687,940 elderlies who had not visited hospitals due to COPD for 3 years (from 2008 to 2010) were followed-up from 2011 to 2016. The first hospital visit due to COPD during the follow-up period was regarded as COPD development. Daily district-level PM2.5 concentrations were estimated by chemical transport model and 60-month moving average PM2.5 were assigned to each subject in time-varying Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: The mean concentration of modelled PM2.5 in 7 metropolitan cities during the study period (from 2006 to 2016) was 28.0 mug/m(3) and 259,700 subjects newly visited the hospital due to COPD. COPD hospital visit hazard ratio for a 10 mug/m(3) increase in 60-month moving average PM2.5 concentration was 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.07, 1.11). Risks remained unchanged following different PM2.5 exposure levels (48-month moving average, and average PM2.5 concentrations for 2008 and 2008-2010) and in subgroup analysis by subject characteristics (sex, age, and income groups). DISCUSSION: By following-up 687,940 elderly subjects who resided in metropolitan cities in Korea for 6 years, long-term PM2.5 exposure showed association with COPD development.",0
144218,Leukoplakias of the larynx (i. clinical and histological classification) (author's transl),"A clinical and histological classification of leukoplakias of the larynx is described. Basis for this classification is the prognostically important systematical, histologic and cytologic knowledge gained in gynecology. The early clinical diagnosis limited to a macroscopic description of leukoplakias is completed by a prognostic attribute won by cytology and/or histology. Thus the final diagnosis of precancerous lesions of the larynx is classified into leukoplakias with low-graded dysplasias, middle-graded dysplasia, highgraded dysplasia and atypical epithelium. The old nomenclature regards dysplasias as facultative precancerous lesions and the atypical epithelium as an obligatory precancerous lesion.",0
10780316,Intermediate and severe hyperhomocysteinemia with thrombosis: a study of genetic determinants,"Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In search of genetic factors causing elevated levels of total homocysteine in plasma (tHcy), we investigated a cohort of consecutively identified, unrelated thrombosis patients (n = 28) having intermediate or severe hyperhomocysteinemia (30 micromol/l<tHcy < or =100 micromol/l, and tHcy > 100 micromol/l, respectively). The methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C-->T genotype, and the complete cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) genotype was determined in all patients. We found that the MTHFR T/T genotype was strongly correlated with intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia, being present in 73.9% of those cases (17 of 23). In three of five patients with severe hyperhomocysteinemia, compound heterozygosity for CBS mutations was detected. Among the mutations, two novel missense mutations: 1265C-->T (S422L) and 1397C-->T (S466L) were detected. The phenotype in those patients was quite mild, thromboembolism apart. This indicates that a search for CBS mutations in patients with severe hyperhomocysteinemia is important to ensure the detection of a possible CBS deficiency, thus enabling treatment. Co-existence of the MTHFR T/T genotype and the common CBS 844ins68 variant was significantly higher among patients (10.7%) as compared to controls (1.2%), indicating that this genotype combination is a thrombotic risk factor (P <0.05). In a few patients, hyperhomocysteinemia could not be explained by this genetic approach, suggesting that other genetic risk factors were implicated.",1

The normal restriction pattern has not been altered by a t(3;8)(p14.2;q24.1) characteristic for a hereditary form of renal cell carcinoma, indicating that the breakpoint itself is not included in any of the mapped areas. We have found a CpG island within the DNF15S2 locus, suggesting the presence of a functional gene in the region.",1
20971946,Identification of a novel A4GALT exon reveals the genetic basis of the P1/P2 histo-blood groups,"The A4GALT locus encodes a glycosyltransferase that synthesizes the terminal Galalpha1-4Gal of the P(k) (Gb3/CD77) glycosphingolipid, important in transfusion medicine, obstetrics, and pathogen susceptibility. Critical nucleotide changes in A4GALT not only abolish P(k) formation but also another Galalpha1-4Gal-defined antigen, P1, which belongs to the only blood group system for which the responsible locus remains undefined. Since known A4GALT polymorphisms do not explain the P1-P(k)+ phenotype, P(2), we set out to elucidate the genetic basis of P(1)/P(2). Despite marked differences (P(1) > P(2)) in A4GALT transcript levels in blood, luciferase experiments showed no difference between P(1)/P(2)-related promoter sequences. Investigation of A4GALT mRNA in cultured human bone marrow cells revealed novel transcripts containing only the noncoding exon 1 and a sequence (here termed exon 2a) from intron 1. These 5'-capped transcripts include poly-A tails and 3 polymorphic sites, one of which was P(1)/P(2)-specific among > 200 donors and opens a short reading frame in P(2) alleles. We exploited these data to devise the first genotyping assays to predict P1 status. P(1)/P(2) genotypes correlated with both transcript levels and P1/P(k) expression on red cells. Thus, P(1) zygosity partially explains the well-known interindividual variation in P1 strength. Future investigations need to focus on regulatory mechanisms underlying P1 synthesis.",1
14766204,Human Crossveinless-2 is a novel inhibitor of bone morphogenetic proteins,"Drosophila Crossveinless-2 (dCV-2) is required for local activation of Mad phosphorylation in the fruit fly wing and has been postulated to be a positive regulator of BMP-mediated signaling. In contrast, the presence of 5 Chordin-like cysteine-rich domains in the CV-2 protein suggests that CV-2 belongs to a family of well-established inhibitors of BMP function that includes Chordin and Sog [Development 127 (2000) 3947]. We have identified a human homolog of Drosophila CV-2 (hCV-2). Here we show that purified recombinant hCV-2 protein inhibits BMP-2 and BMP-4 dependent osteogenic differentiation of W-20-17 cells, as well as BMP dependent chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells. Interestingly, hCV-2 messenger RNA is expressed at high levels in human primary chondrocytes, whereas expression in primary human osteoblasts is low. These results suggest that hCV-2 may regulate BMP responsiveness of osteoblasts and chondrocytes in vivo. Taken together we have shown that contrary to the function predicted from the fruit fly, Crossveinless-2 is a novel inhibitor of BMP function.",1
18806802,Cyclophilin D deficiency attenuates mitochondrial and neuronal perturbation and ameliorates learning and memory in Alzheimer's disease,"Cyclophilin D (CypD, encoded by Ppif) is an integral part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, whose opening leads to cell death. Here we show that interaction of CypD with mitochondrial amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) potentiates mitochondrial, neuronal and synaptic stress. The CypD-deficient cortical mitochondria are resistant to Abeta- and Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial swelling and permeability transition. Additionally, they have an increased calcium buffering capacity and generate fewer mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the absence of CypD protects neurons from Abeta- and oxidative stress-induced cell death. Notably, CypD deficiency substantially improves learning and memory and synaptic function in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model and alleviates Abeta-mediated reduction of long-term potentiation. Thus, the CypD-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition pore is directly linked to the cellular and synaptic perturbations observed in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Blockade of CypD may be a therapeutic strategy in Alzheimer's disease.",1

15886284,Mice lacking multidrug resistance protein 3 show altered morphine pharmacokinetics and morphine-6-glucuronide antinociception,"Glucuronidation is a major detoxification pathway for endogenous and exogenous compounds in mammals that results in the intracellular formation of polar metabolites, requiring specialized transporters to cross biological membranes. By using morphine as a model aglycone, we demonstrate that multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3/ABCC3), a protein present in the basolateral membrane of polarized cells, transports morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide in vitro. Mrp3(-/-) mice are unable to excrete M3G from the liver into the bloodstream, the major hepatic elimination route for this drug. This results in increased levels of M3G in liver and bile, a 50-fold reduction in the plasma levels of M3G, and in a major shift in the main disposition route for morphine and M3G, predominantly via the urine in WT mice but via the feces in Mrp3(-/-) mice. The pharamacokinetics of injected morphine-glucuronides are altered as well in the absence of Mrp3, and this results in a decreased antinociceptive potency of injected morphine-6-glucuronide.",1
20087419,Biallelic mutation of protocadherin-21 (PCDH21) causes retinal degeneration in humans,"PURPOSE: To describe the clinical findings and mutations in affected members of two families with an autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy associated with mutations in the protocadherin-21 (PCDH21) gene. METHODS: A full genome scan of members of two consanguineous families segregating an autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy was performed and regions identical by descent identified. Positional candidate genes were identified and sequenced. All patients had a detailed ophthalmic examination, including electroretinography and retinal imaging. RESULTS: Affected members of both families showed identical homozygosity for an overlapping region of chromosome 10q. Sequencing of a candidate gene, PCDH21, showed two separate homozygous single-base deletions, c.337delG (p.G113AfsX1) and c.1459delG (p.G487GfsX20), which were not detected in 282 control chromosomes. Affected members of the two families first reported nyctalopia in late teenage years and retained good central vision until their late 30s. No color vision was detected in any proband. The fundus appearance included the later development of characteristic circular patches of pigment epithelial atrophy at the macula and in the peripheral retina. CONCLUSIONS: Biallelic mutations in the photoreceptor-specific gene PCDH21 cause recessive retinal degeneration in humans.",1

2883116,Heterogeneity of human C4 gene size. A large intron (6.5 kb) is present in all C4A genes and some C4B genes,"In this article we present a study showing that the human C4 genes differ in length because of the presence or absence of a 6.5 kb intron near the 5' end of the gene. DNA from individuals of known HLA, factor B, and C4 haplotypes was analyzed for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) by Southern blot analysis with C4-specific cDNA probes. The RFLP patterns obtained showed that the C4 genes are either 22.5 kb or 16 kb in length. They are referred to as long and short C4 genes, respectively. A population study was carried out to examine the distribution of the gene size according to C4 allotypes and haplotypes. Long C4 genes included all C4A genes studied and also some C4B allotypes, e.g., B1 on most C4 A3B1 haplotypes. Similarly, C4B null genes were found to be of the long form. Other C4B allotypes tested were found to be coded for by short C4 genes, including B2, B1 in C4 A6B1 and C4 AQOB1 (with a single C4B gene haplotype).",1
31085932,Strategies Utilized by Speech-Language Pathologists to Effectively Address the Communication Needs of Migrant School-Age Children,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The number of migrant children referred to speech-language pathologists (SLPs) is increasing in the United States. SLPs need to be competent in distinguishing between a language disorder and language differences associated with children who are learning English as a new language. METHODS: SLPs need to acquire the knowledge, skills, and cultural attitudes to evaluate language of bilingual children to competently assess and intervene with linguistically diverse children and families. Often children separated from their biological parents at the border are placed in foster homes, and the foster parents often do not have essential information regarding the children's developmental history to share with the SLP. The children described in this article include school-age children in the United States who are learning to speak English as a second language and are migrants. RESULTS: This article presents the difficulties faced when working with children learning a new language, effective strategies used with this population, and some of the resources available in the United States for children and families. CONCLUSION: This article highlights some challenges SLPs experience, assessment protocols used in different states and local school districts, successful strategies that involve working with interpreters, and varied service delivery options.",0
1338904,Somatic mutations of the APC gene in colorectal tumors: mutation cluster region in the APC gene,"We examined somatic mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene in 63 colorectal tumors (16 adenomas and 47 carcinomas) developed in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and non-FAP patients. In addition to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the APC locus in 30 tumors, 43 other somatic mutations were detected. Twenty-one of them were point mutations; 16 nonsense and two missense mutations, and three occurred in introns at the splicing site. Twenty-two tumors had frameshift mutations due to deletion or insertion; nineteen of them were deletions of one to 31 bp and three were a 1-bp insertion. One tumor had a 1-bp deletion in an intron near the splicing site. Hence, 41 (95%) of 43 mutations resulted in truncation of the APC protein. Over 60% of the somatic mutations in the APC gene were clustered within a small region of exon 15, designated as MCR (mutation cluster region), which accounted for less than 10% of the coding region. Combining these data and the results of LOH, more than 80% of tumors (14 adenomas and 39 carcinomas) had at least one mutation in the APC gene, of which more than 60% (9 adenomas and 23 carcinomas) had two mutations. These results strongly suggest that somatic mutations of the APC gene are associated with development of a great majority of colorectal tumors.",1
31583751,Hepatoprotective effects of red beetroot-based beverages against CCl4 -induced hepatic stress in Sprague Dawley rats,"Red beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.) is considered important to improve hepatic health but its use is primarily limited to fresh salads in Pakistan. This study was aimed at exploring prophylactic role of red beetroot-based beverages against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 )-induced hepatic stress. Purposely, red beetroot-based beverages (8 ml/kg b.w. per day) were administered to normal and hepatotoxicity-induced rats for 8 weeks. The biochemical analyses revealed significantly higher levels of superoxide dismutase (25%-28%), catalase (21%-24%), and hepatic enzymes (15%-19%) alongside reduced lipid peroxidation (27%-32%) in liver tissues of hepatotoxicity-induced rats treated with beetroot-based beverages compared to control. Similarly, hepatic injury was reduced by 19%-26% as indicated by concentrations of serum hepatic health biomarkers. Moreover, histological architecture of hepatocytes also portrayed promising effects of beetroot-based beverages to preserve hepatocellular portfolio. It was concluded that red beetroot-based beverages considerably assuage negative impacts of hepatic stress. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Functional foods and nutraceuticals are considered vital in controlling the oxidative stress-mediated metabolic disorders as safer alternatives to pharmaceutical agents. The current research explored the protective effects of red beetroot-based beverages which can be utilized as an effective approach to prevent liver injuries. Also, the outcomes of this research endorsed the defensive role of these beverages against oxidative stress-induced hepatic stress, so dietary supplementation of such products can be synchronized in clinical practices to alleviate oxidative stress. However, there is a need to further explore the safety aspects of such products in their long-term usage before implementing this module in humans for disease prevention/cure.",0
9516223,CDKN2A mutations in multiple primary melanomas,"BACKGROUND: Germ-line mutations in the CDKN2A tumor-suppressor gene (also known as p16, p16INK4a, and MTS1) have been linked to the development of melanoma in some families with inherited melanoma. Whether mutations in CDKN2A confer a predisposition to sporadic (nonfamilial) melanoma is not known. In some patients with sporadic melanoma, one or more additional primary lesions develop, suggesting that some of these patients have an underlying genetic susceptibility to the cancer. We hypothesized that this predisposition might be due to germ-line CDKN2A mutations. METHODS: We used the polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and direct DNA sequencing to identify germ-line mutations in the CDKN2A gene in patients with multiple primary melanomas who did not have family histories of the disease. A quantitative yeast two-hybrid assay was used to evaluate the functional importance of the CDKN2A variants. RESULTS: Of 33 patients with multiple primary melanomas, 5 (15 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 4 percent to 27 percent) had germ-line CDKN2A mutations. These included a 24-bp insertion at the 5' end of the coding sequence, three missense mutations (Arg24Pro, Met53Ile, and Ser56Ile), and a 2-bp deletion at position 307 to 308 (resulting in a truncated CDKN2A protein). In three families, CDKN2A mutations identical to those in the probands were found in other family members. In two families with mutations, we uncovered previously unknown evidence of family histories of melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients with multiple primary melanomas but without family histories of the disease have germ-line mutations of the CDKN2A gene. The presence of multiple primary melanomas may signal a genetic susceptibility to melanoma not only in the index patient but also in family members, who may benefit from melanoma-surveillance programs.",1

However, diagnostic terminology and management vary from centre to centre. Pharmacotherapy in conjunction with individual and family therapy is generally accepted as the most effective treatment, while psychostimulants are the drug of choice. The results of clinical studies with indications, contraindications and side-effects are reviewed. The use of alternative pharmacotherapy for those who do not respond to treatment and long term therapy is discussed. The need for careful diagnosis and patient management is emphasized.",0
10224948,Individual psychopathology and marital distress. Analyzing the association and implications for therapy,"This article is a review of the association of individual and marital problems. The focus is on depression, alcohol abuse, anxiety disorders, and the functional psychoses, each of which interact with marital distress in important ways. Although the causal connections between these disorders and marital distress are complex and only particularly understood, the available evidence shows that individuals' and couples' problems often exacerbate each other. Consequently, regardless of whether the initial presentation is individual or couple focused, there is routinely a need to assess both individual and relationship functioning. Couples therapy, and in particular behavioral couples therapy (BCT), is an important element of effective treatment of depression, alcohol abuse, anxiety disorders, and the functional psychoses. The integration of couple and individual therapy presents a number of clinical challenges, and in concluding this article the authors provide guidelines for managing these challenges.",0
25912921,Fertility in China: An uncertain future,"As one of the world's two population 'billionaires', the future of China's population is truly of global significance. With its very low fertility and a rapidly ageing population, it might appear that the country's famous (or notorious) family planning restrictions are somewhat anachronistic. Here, we explore the process of reform seen over the past three decades and, most recently, in late 2013. We suggest that the popular notion that the family planning restrictions are acting as a pressure valve suppressing a pent-up demand for childbearing, particularly in rural China, is likely to be inaccurate. We also suggest that further reform of the restrictions will not solve the problems of population ageing or many of the other issues widely associated with the restrictions. We conclude that the prospects for further reform are wide-ranging, but likely to be beset by many challenges. ",0
24905064,ARMC5 mutations are common in familial bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia,"CONTEXT: Bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH) is a rare form of adrenal Cushing's syndrome. Familial cases have been reported, but at the time we conducted this study, the genetic basis of BMAH was unknown. Recently, germline variants of armadillo repeat containing 5 (ARMC5) in patients with isolated BMAH and somatic, second-hit mutations in tumor nodules, were identified. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to identify the genetic basis of familial BMAH. DESIGN: We performed whole exome capture and sequencing of 2 affected individuals from each of 4 BMAH families (BMAH-01, BMAH-02, BMAH-03, and BMAH-05). Based on clinical evaluation, there were 7, 3, 3, and 4 affected individuals in these families, respectively. Sanger sequencing of ARMC5 was performed in 1 other BMAH kindred, BMAH-06. RESULTS: Exome sequencing identified novel variants Chr16:g.31477540, c.2139delT, p.(Thr715Leufs*1) (BMAH-02) and Chr16:g.31473811, c.943C-->T, p.(Arg315Trp) (BMAH-03) in ARMC5 (GRch37/hg19), validated by Sanger sequencing. BMAH-01 had a recently reported mutation Chr16:g.31476121, c.1777C-->T, p.(Arg593Trp). Sanger sequencing of ARMC5 in BMAH-06 identified a previously reported mutation, Chr16:g. 31473688; c.799C-->T, p.(Arg267*). The genetic basis of BMAH in BMAH-05 was not identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies have detected ARMC5 mutations in 4 of 5 BMAH families tested, confirming that these mutations are a frequent cause of BMAH. Two of the 4 families had novel mutations, indicating allelic heterogeneity. Preclinical evaluation did not predict mutation status. The ARMC5-negative family had unusual prominent hyperaldosteronism. Further studies are needed to determine the penetrance of BMAH in ARMC5 mutation-positive relatives of affected patients, the practical utility of genetic screening and genotype-phenotype correlations.",1
17377531,Myc deletion rescues Apc deficiency in the small intestine,"The APC gene encodes the adenomatous polyposis coli tumour suppressor protein, germline mutation of which characterizes familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal intestinal cancer syndrome. Inactivation of APC is also recognized as the key early event in the development of sporadic colorectal cancers, and its loss results in constitutive activity of the beta-catenin-Tcf4 transcription complex. The proto-oncogene c-MYC has been identified as a target of the Wnt pathway in colorectal cancer cells in vitro, in normal crypts in vivo and in intestinal epithelial cells acutely transformed on in vivo deletion of the APC gene; however, the significance of this is unclear. Therefore, to elucidate the role Myc has in the intestine after Apc loss, we have simultaneously deleted both Apc and Myc in the adult murine small intestine. Here we show that loss of Myc rescued the phenotypes of perturbed differentiation, migration, proliferation and apoptosis, which occur on deletion of Apc. Remarkably, this rescue occurred in the presence of high levels of nuclear beta-catenin. Array analysis revealed that Myc is required for the majority of Wnt target gene activation following Apc loss. These data establish Myc as the critical mediator of the early stages of neoplasia following Apc loss.",1
12852581,Level of endogenous formaldehyde in maple syrup as determined by spectrofluorimetry,"The level of endogenous formaldehyde in maple syrup was established from a large number (n = 300) of authentic maple syrup samples collected during 2000 and 2001 in the province of Quebec, Canada. The average level of formaldehyde from these authentic samples was measured at 0.18 mg/kg in 2000 and 0.28 mg/kg in 2001, which is lower than previously published. These average values can be attributed to the improved spectrofluorimetric method used for the determination. However, the formaldehyde values obtained demonstrate a relatively large distribution with maximums observed at 1.04 and 1.54 mg/kg. These values are still under the maximum tolerance level of 2.0 mg/kg paraformaldehyde pesticide residue. Extensive heat treatment of maple syrup samples greatly enhanced the formaldehyde concentration of the samples, suggesting that extensive heat degradation of the sap constituents during evaporation could be responsible for the highest formaldehyde values in maple syrup.",0
10441572,"Early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease: prevalence, genetic heterogeneity, and mutation spectrum","To determine the prevalence of early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) and of autosomal dominant forms of EOAD (ADEOAD), we performed a population-based study in the city of Rouen (426,710 residents). EOAD was defined as onset of disease at age <61 years, and ADEOAD was defined as the occurrence of at least three EOAD cases in three generations. Using these stringent criteria, we calculated that the EOAD and ADEOAD prevalences per 100,000 persons at risk were 41.2 and 5.3, respectively. We then performed a mutational analysis of the genes for amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) in 34 families with ADEOAD ascertained in France. In 19 (56%) of these families, we identified 16 distinct PSEN1 missense mutations, including 4 (Thr147Ile, Trp165Cys, Leu173Trp, and Ser390Ile) not reported elsewhere. APP mutations, including a novel mutation located at codon 715, were identified in 5 (15%) of the families. In the 10 remaining ADEOAD families and in 9 additional autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease families that did not fulfill the strict criteria for ADEOAD, no PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP mutation was identified. These results show that (1) PSEN1 and APP mutations account for 71% of ADEOAD families and (2) nonpenetrance at age <61 years is probably infrequent for PSEN1 or APP mutations.",1
6197180,Developmental activation of the H-2K gene is correlated with an increase in DNA methylation,"Embryonal carcinoma cell lines present strong developmental analogies with early embryonic cells. Previous studies have shown that treatment of F9 teratocarcinoma cells with retinoic acid induces the expression of the classical transplantation antigens which are indispensable for effective interactions between cells. In contrast to several genes that were analyzed, all of which were highly and heterogeneously methylated in F9 cells, the H-2K gene was poorly methylated if at all. Activation of the H-2K gene upon differentiation of F9 cells was accompanied by an increase in DNA methylation. While increased methylation of the H-2K gene in one of the two homologous chromosomes was correlated with a low level of expression, increased methylation in both chromosomes was associated with a high level of expression. Treatment of differentiated F9 cells with 5-azacytidine resulted in inhibition of DNA methylation and a concomitant repression of the H-2K gene expression. Thus, in contrast to the many examples of an inverse correlation between the level of gene methylation and its transcriptional activity, expression of the H-2K gene is directly correlated with the extent of methylation. This finding offers an explanation whereby the hypomethylation observed in tumor cells may be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of a malignant state of growth.",0
6020401,Evidence for multiple molecular forms of yeast beta-glucosidase in a hybrid yeast,"A mixture of beta-glucosidases from Saccharomyces fragilis (Y-18) and S. dobzhanskii (Y-19) eluted from diethylaminoethyl cellulose in two peaks, whereas the enzyme from a hybrid, S. fragilis x S. dobzhanskii (Y-42), eluted in a single broad peak. The highest Y-42 activity fractions eluted at a sodium chloride molarity which was intermediate to the molarities at which most of the Y-18 and Y-19 activity was eluted. In cellulose polyacetate strips, Y-42 enzyme migrated as a diffuse band which spanned the distances migrated by the enzymes from the parent yeast strains. Antisera against either Y-18 or Y-19 enzyme precipitated 80 to 90% of Y-42 enzyme activity. When Y-42 enzyme was dissociated by heat or urea and reacted with parental antiserum, a concomitant increase in the opposite parental activity was demonstrable in both precipitation and complement-fixation (CF) tests. Urea-dissociated beta-glucosidases were resolvable by sucrose-gradient centrifugation into multiple bands displaying specific CF activity. When the enzymes were exposed to 4 m urea for 12 min, particles of approximately 110,000 molecular weight were obtained. By extending the exposure time to 40 min, and incorporating 0.5 m urea in the gradients, smaller particles were detected with molecular weights ranging from 18,000 to 23,000. Attempts to regenerate enzyme activity after dissociation with urea were only moderately successful. Results suggested that a slightly acidic environment favored reassociation, as did the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Residual urea also seemed important. It is proposed that the structural genes for both Y-18 and Y-19 enzyme are present in Y-42 cells with either independent or closely interacting regulatory mechanisms. Since synthesis of the two parental-type polypeptides may be unequal, the availability of enzyme subunits for subsequent polymerization in the cell cytoplasm might be equalized at the polysome level.

In addition to two new lignans, named koreanaside A ((7R,8S,7'R,8'S)-7,7'-diepoxy-5'-hydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxylignan 4-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside) and koreanaside B ((7R,8S,7'S,8'R)-7,9'-epoxy-9,5',7'-trihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxylignan 4-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside), four known lignans were identified to be (+)-phylligenin, (-)-epipinoresinol, pinoresinol, and tinosposide A. The structures and absolute configurations of koreanasides A and B were established by means of analysis of spectroscopic data (NMR, IR, FAB-MS, and CD), whereas the structures of known lignans were identified by comparison their NMR and MS values with those in the reported literature. Their chemical structures including configuration were established by means of analysis of spectroscopic data (NMR, IR, FAB-MS, and CD) but also comparison of their NMR and MS values with those in the reported literature. This is the first article for isolation of six lignans of F. koreana flowers. Koreanasides A and B showed high radical scavenging activity with oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values of 0.97 +/- 0.01 and 1.02 +/- 0.01, respectively. Koreanaside A also prohibited expressing VCAM-1 in MOVAS cells with 80.5% at 25 mg/mL.",0
19064730,"AKT inhibitor, GSK690693, induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines","The PI3K/AKT signaling is activated in various hematologic malignancies. We evaluated the effect of a novel, pan-AKT kinase inhibitor, GSK690693, on the proliferation of 112 cell lines representing different hematologic neoplasia. Fifty-five percent of all cell lines tested were sensitive to AKT inhibitor (EC(50)<1 microM), with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma showing 89%, 73%, and 67% sensitivity to GSK690693, respectively. The antiproliferative effect was selective for the malignant cells, as GSK690693 did not inhibit the proliferation of normal human CD4(+) peripheral T lymphocytes as well as mouse thymocytes. Phosphorylation of downstream substrates of AKT was reduced in both sensitive and insensitive cell lines on treatment with GSK690693, suggesting that the cause of resistance was not related to the lack of AKT kinase inhibition. Consistent with the role of AKT in cell survival, GSK690693 also induced apoptosis in sensitive ALL cell lines. Overall, our data provide direct evidence for the role of AKT signaling in various hematologic malignancies, especially ALL and some lymphomas.",0
14657366,Hyperactivated sperm motility driven by CatSper2 is required for fertilization,"Elevations of sperm Ca2+ seem to be responsible for an asymmetric form of motility called hyperactivation, which is first seen near the time of fertilization. The mechanism by which intracellular Ca2+ concentrations increase remains unknown despite considerable investigation. Although several prototypical voltage-gated calcium channels are present in spermatozoa, they are not essential for motility. Furthermore, the forward velocity and percentage of motility of spermatozoa are associated with infertility, but their importance relative to hyperactivation also remains unknown. We show here that disruption of the gene for a recently described sperm-specific voltage-gated cation channel, CatSper2, fails to significantly alter sperm production, protein tyrosine phosphorylation that is associated with capacitation, induction of the acrosome reaction, forward velocity, or percentage of motility, yet CatSper2-/- males are completely infertile. The defect that we identify in the null sperm cells is a failure to acquire hyperactivated motility, which seems to render spermatozoa incapable of generating the ",1
23575401,Intraperitoneal or subcutaneous: does location of the (colo)rectal stump influence outcomes after laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy for ulcerative colitis?,"BACKGROUND: The optimal management of the closed defunctionalized large-bowel stump after laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy for ulcerative colitis remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare postoperative outcomes after different techniques of management of the defunctionalized (colo)rectal stump. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Patients undergoing laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy for ulcerative colitis during 1998 to 2010 were assigned to an intraperitoneal group (creation of Hartmann rectal stump) or a subcutaneous group (subcutaneous placement of rectosigmoid stump). OUTCOME MEASURE: Postoperative morbidity was defined as complications occurred within 30 days after the operation or during the same hospital stay. RESULTS: Of 204 patients, 99 were in the intraperitoneal group and 105 were in the subcutaneous group. There were no significant differences in demographics or preoperative data, with the exception of a significantly increased age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index and preoperative total parental nutrition use in the intraperitoneal group. There was 1 postoperative death for myocardial infarction in the subcutaneous group. Overall postoperative morbidity, pelvic sepsis rates, and length of hospital stay were similar. Stump leaks occurred in 5 patients in the intraperitoneal group vs 10 patients in the subcutaneous group (p = 0.23). All stump leaks in the subcutaneous group only required local wound treatments without causing pelvic sepsis or need for reoperation. Pelvic sepsis in the intraperitoneal group required reoperation in 1 case, CT-guided drainage in 3, and antibiotics alone in 2 cases. Pelvic sepsis in the subcutaneous group required CT-guided drainage in 3 cases and antibiotics alone in 1 case. CONCLUSION: With the limitations of a retrospective study, postoperative outcomes were comparable after either technique of stump management, none of which could offset the risk of pelvic sepsis. Subcutaneous placement of colorectal stump was associated with more frequent but less morbid complications.",0
1415888,Handball injuries. An epidemiologic and socioeconomic study,"A total of 570 injuries in handball players were prospectively registered in a well-defined geographic area of 124,321 inhabitants. The incidence of handball injuries was 46 per 10,000 inhabitants per year. The incidence in women (61 per 10,000 per year) was double that of men (31 per 10,000 per year). Sixty-two percent of the injuries were ligament sprains and tears and 12% were fractures. A total of 7% of the patients were hospitalized and the total loss of income because of sick leave was $3870. Sixty-eight percent of the injured handball players were absent from handball more than 1 week. Surprisingly, 8% of the minor injuries resulted in a sick leave of more than 6 days.",0
20503313,"CDKN1C (p57(Kip2)) analysis in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) patients: Genotype-phenotype correlations, novel mutations, and polymorphisms","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an overgrowth syndrome characterized by macroglossia, macrosomia, and abdominal wall defects. It is a multigenic disorder caused in most patients by alterations in growth regulatory genes. A small number of individuals with BWS (5-10%) have mutations in CDKN1C, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor of G1 cyclin complexes that functions as a negative regulator of cellular growth and proliferation. Here, we report on eight patients with BWS and CDKN1C mutations and review previous reported cases. We analyzed 72 patients (50 BWS, 17 with isolated hemihyperplasia (IH), three with omphalocele, and two with macroglossia) for CDKN1C defects with the aim to search for new mutations and to define genotype-phenotype correlations. Our findings suggest that BWS patients with CDKN1C mutations have a different pattern of clinical malformations than those with other molecular defects. Polydactyly, genital abnormalities, extra nipple, and cleft palate are more frequently observed in BWS with mutations in CDKN1C. The clinical observation of these malformations may help to decide which genetic characterization should be undertaken (i.e., CDKN1C screening), thus optimizing the laboratory evaluation for BWS.",1
22295705,Study on preparation of acellular matrix material fixed by oxidized sodium alginate and its cytocompatibility,"This study was intended to investigate the crosslinking characteristics of a new crosslinking agent-oxidized sodium alginate (ADA), which might provide an ideal biological crosslinking reagent for the construction of soft tissue bioprostheses. Glutaraldehyde and genipin, which have been typically used in developing bioprostheses, were used as controls. The porcine aortas were treated by these three crosslinking agents for 15 min to 72 h and the fixation index was determined. Subsequently, the mechanical property and cytocompatibility of fixed tissues were also tested. The results indicated that fixed tissues by ADA were comparable as glutaraldehyde and superior to genipin controls in fixative efficiency. It was also found that tissues fixed by ADA were comparable as genipin and superior to glutaraldehyde controls in cytocompatibility and were similar to natural tissues in mechanical property. The results of in vitro study demonstrated that ADA could be a promising crosslinking reagent for biological tissue fixation.",0

25579749,Impact of the introduction of neuraxial labor analgesia on mode of delivery at an urban maternity hospital in China,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the introduction of neuraxial (epidural) labor analgesia and mode of delivery in a large urban maternity hospital in China. METHODS: A single-intervention impact study was conducted at Shijiazhuang Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital in Shijiazhuang. Baseline data collection occurred between August 1 and December 31, 2009, when no analgesic method was routinely employed during labor. An intervention was then implemented, consisting of a neuraxial labor analgesia service. The service was fully operational from September 1, 2010, and data were collected to August 31, 2011. The mode of delivery was compared between the different periods. RESULTS: Neuraxial analgesia rate was used in none of the 3787 deliveries during the baseline period and 3429 (33.5%) of 10 230 in the implementation period. Cesareans were performed in 1533 (40.5%) deliveries in the baseline period and 3441 (33.6%) in the implementation period (difference -6.8%, 99.8% confidence interval [CI] -9.7% to -3.9%; P<0.0017). The proportion of vaginal deliveries in which forceps were used was unchanged (difference -0.8%, 99.8% CI -0.7% to 2.2%; P=0.92). CONCLUSION: The introduction of epidural analgesia reduced the frequency of cesarean delivery, which improved obstetric and neonatal outcomes.",0
23334414,A T-bet gradient controls the fate and function of CCR6-RORgammat+ innate lymphoid cells,"At mucosal surfaces, the immune system should not initiate inflammatory immune responses to the plethora of antigens constantly present in the environment, but should remain poised to unleash a potent assault on intestinal pathogens. The transcriptional programs and regulatory factors required for immune cells to switch from homeostatic (often tissue-protective) function to potent antimicrobial immunity are poorly defined. Mucosal retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor-gammat-positive (RORgammat(+)) innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are emerging as an important innate lymphocyte population required for immunity to intestinal infections. Various subsets of RORgammat(+) ILCs have been described but the transcriptional programs controlling their specification and fate remain largely unknown. Here we provide evidence that the transcription factor T-bet determines the fate of a distinct lineage of CCR6(-)RORgammat(+) ILCs. Postnatally emerging CCR6(-)RORgammat(+) ILCs upregulated T-bet and this was controlled by cues from the commensal microbiota and interleukin-23 (IL-23). In contrast, CCR6(+)RORgammat(+) ILCs, which arise earlier during ontogeny, did not express T-bet. T-bet instructed the expression of T-bet target genes such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and of the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp46. Mice genetically lacking T-bet showed normal development of CCR6(-)RORgammat(+) ILCs, but they could not differentiate into NKp46-expressing RORgammat(+) ILCs (that is, IL-22-producing natural killer (NK-22) cells) and failed to produce IFN-gamma. The production of IFN-gamma by T-bet-expressing CCR6(-)RORgammat(+) ILCs was essential for the release of mucus-forming glycoproteins required to protect the epithelial barrier during Salmonella enterica infection. Salmonella infection also causes severe enterocolitis that is at least partly driven by IFN-gamma. Mice deficient for T-bet or depleted of ILCs developed only mild enterocolitis. Thus, graded expression of T-bet in CCR6(-)RORgammat(+) ILCs facilitates the differentiation of IFN-gamma-producing CCR6(-)RORgammat(+) ILCs required to protect the epithelial barrier against Salmonella infections. Co-expression of T-bet and RORgammat, which is also found in subsets of IL-17-producing T-helper (T(H)17) cells, may be an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional program that originally developed as part of the innate defence against infections but that also confers an increased risk of immune-mediated pathology.",1
20505670,Structural basis for 5'-nucleotide base-specific recognition of guide RNA by human AGO2,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mediate post-transcriptional gene regulation through association with Argonaute proteins (AGOs). Crystal structures of archaeal and bacterial homologues of AGOs have shown that the MID (middle) domain mediates the interaction with the phosphorylated 5' end of the miRNA guide strand and this interaction is thought to be independent of the identity of the 5' nucleotide in these systems. However, analysis of the known sequences of eukaryotic miRNAs and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that there is a clear bias for U or A at the 5' position. Here we report the crystal structure of a MID domain from a eukaryotic AGO protein, human AGO2. The structure, in complex with nucleoside monophosphates (AMP, CMP, GMP, and UMP) mimicking the 5' end of miRNAs, shows that there are specific contacts made between the base of UMP or AMP and a rigid loop in the MID domain. Notably, the structure of the loop discriminates against CMP and GMP and dissociation constants calculated from NMR titration experiments confirm these results, showing that AMP (0.26 mM) and UMP (0.12 mM) bind with up to 30-fold higher affinity than either CMP (3.6 mM) or GMP (3.3 mM). This study provides structural evidence for nucleotide-specific interactions in the MID domain of eukaryotic AGO proteins and explains the observed preference for U or A at the 5' end of miRNAs.",1

METHODS: Eighty-one patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2014) were enrolled. Patients were assigned to two groups: QYHJ plus BBD group (40 cases) and QYHJ only group (41 cases), and there were no significant differences for other treatment between two groups. The survival and cancer-related symptoms were compared between two groups over two cycles of treatment. RESULTS: The cancer-related symptoms of patients such as ascites, jaundice, pain, abdominal distension, anorexia and Karnofsky performance status of QYHJ plus BBD group were significantly improved as compared with those of the QYHJ group (P<0.01). In addition, the 1-year survival rate of patients in QYHJ plus BBD group was longer than that in the QYHJ group (65% vs. 33%, respectively, P=0.0023). CONCLUSIONS: BBD with QYHJ is feasible treatment to prolong the survival of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. However, it deserves to be further investigated in randomized clinical trials.",0

20029458,CASK mutations are frequent in males and cause X-linked nystagmus and variable XLMR phenotypes,"Mutations of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) gene have recently been associated with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) with microcephaly, optic atrophy and brainstem and cerebellar hypoplasia, as well as with an X-linked syndrome having some FG-like features. Our group has recently identified four male probands from 358 probable XLMR families with missense mutations (p.Y268H, p.P396S, p.D710G and p.W919R) in the CASK gene. Congenital nystagmus, a rare and striking feature, was present in two of these families. We screened a further 45 probands with either nystagmus or microcephaly and mental retardation (MR), and identified two further mutations, a missense mutation (p.Y728C) and a splice mutation (c.2521-2A>T) in two small families with nystagmus and MR. Detailed clinical examinations of all six families, including an ophthalmological review in four families, were undertaken to further characterise the phenotype. We report on the clinical features of 24 individuals, mostly male, from six families with CASK mutations. The phenotype was variable, ranging from non-syndromic mild MR to severe MR associated with microcephaly and dysmorphic facial features. Carrier females were variably affected. Congenital nystagmus was found in members of four of the families. Our findings reinforce the CASK gene as a relatively frequent cause of XLMR in females and males. We further define the phenotypic spectrum and demonstrate that affected males with missense mutations or in-frame deletions in CASK are frequently associated with congenital nystagmus and XLMR, a striking feature not previously reported.",1
9830022,Identity of the organic cation transporter OCT3 as the extraneuronal monoamine transporter (uptake2) and evidence for the expression of the transporter in the brain,"We investigated the transport of cationic neurotoxins and neurotransmitters by the potential-sensitive organic transporter OCT3 and its steroid sensitivity using heterologous expression systems and also analyzed the expression of OCT3 in the brain. When expressed in mammalian cells, OCT3 mediates the uptake of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) and the neurotransmitter dopamine. Competition experiments show that several cationic neuroactive agents including amphetamines interact with OCT3. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, OCT3-mediated MPP+ uptake is associated with inward currents under voltage-clamp conditions. The MPP+-induced currents are saturable with respect to MPP+ concentration, and half-maximal saturation (K0.5) occurs at about 25 microM MPP+ with membrane potential clamped at -50 mV. The K0.5 for MPP+ is markedly influenced by membrane potential. OCT3 is inhibited by several steroids, and beta-estradiol is the most potent inhibitor (Ki approximately 1 microM). The pattern of steroid sensitivity of OCT3 is different from that of OCT1 and OCT2 but correlates significantly with that of the extraneuronal monoamine transporter (uptake2). The transport characteristics and steroid sensitivity provide strong evidence for the molecular identity of OCT3 as uptake2. OCT3 is expressed in the brain as evidenced from Northern blot analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and in situ hybridization using OCT3-specific probes. The molecular identity of the transcript hybridizing to the probe has been established by sequencing the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction product and also by the isolation of the OCT3 cDNA from a brain cDNA library. Regional distribution studies with in situ hybridization show that OCT3 is expressed widely in different brain regions, especially in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex. OCT3 is likely to play a significant role in the disposition of cationic neurotoxins and neurotransmitters in the brain.",0
24089085,In situ grafting silica nanoparticles reinforced nanocomposite hydrogels,"Highly flexible nanocomposite hydrogels were prepared by using silica nanoparticles (SNPs) as fillers and multi-functional cross-links to graft hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) by free radical polymerization from an aqueous solution. The SNPs were collected by neighboring polymer chains and dispersed uniformly within a PAA matrix. The mechanical properties of the nanocomposite hydrogels were tailored by the concentration of SNPs according to the percolation model. It was proposed that covalent bonds of adsorbed chains on the filler surface resulted in the formation of a shell of an immobilized glassy layer and trapped entanglements, where the glassy polymer layer greatly enhanced the elastic modulus and the release of trapped entanglements at deformation contributed to the viscoelastic properties.

14598163,Identification of two AGTR2 mutations in male patients with non-syndromic mental retardation,"Mutations in the coding region of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor gene (AGTR2) were recently identified to cause X-linked recessive mental retardation. We report a mutation screening of the AGTR2 gene in 57 Finnish male patients with non-syndromic mental retardation. We identified two mutations, a 62G-->T transversion, which leads to a substitution of glycine for valine (G21V) and a 157A-->T transversion, which causes a substitution of isoleucine for phenylalanine (I53F). The patients with AGTR2 sequence variants had severe/profound mental retardation, epileptic seizures, restlessness, hyperactivity, and disturbed development of speech.",1
9288124,Protein kinase C regulates macrophage tumor necrosis factor secretion: direct protein kinase C activation restores tumor necrosis factor production in endotoxin tolerance,"BACKGROUND: Macrophages pretreated in vitro with endotoxin (LPSp) secrete less tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in response to a second LPS activating (LPSa) stimulus. Protein kinase C (PKC) is required for TNF secretion in a macrophage stimulated with LPSa. In these experiments we examined the role of PKC in TNF signal transduction in naive and tolerant macrophages. METHODS: Murine macrophages were cultured +/- LPSp for 24 hours. Cultures were washed and treated for 1 hour with PKC inhibitors or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a direct PKC activator. Cells were then stimulated with a range of LPSa for 6 hours, and TNF was determined by bioassay. RESULTS: LPSa-stimulated TNF secretion by nontolerant macrophages was inhibited by LPSp in the absence of PMA. PKC inhibitors decreased TNF by naive macrophages and exaggerated inhibition in tolerant cells. Depletion of PKC by 24 hours of PMA decreased TNF production by both naive and tolerant macrophages. PKC activation with PMA 1 hour before LPSa augmented TNF secretion in naive cells and reversed TNF inhibition of tolerant cells. CONCLUSIONS: Direct PKC activation with PMA restored TNF secretion in LPS-tolerant macrophages. Endotoxin tolerance may alter the LPSa signal transduction pathway between the LPS receptor and PKC activation.",0

18337828,Partial depletion of mitochondrial DNA from human skin fibroblasts induces a gene expression profile reminiscent of photoaged skin,"In photoaged skin, wrinkles result from an increased degradation and a decreased de novo synthesis of collagen fibers. At the molecular level, photoaged skin is characterized by increased amounts of large-scale deletions of the mitochondrial (mt) genome such as the 4,977 bp common deletion. The common deletion can be generated in dermal fibroblasts through repetitive ultraviolet (UV) A irradiation, and this was found to be associated with an increased expression of the collagen-degrading enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1). These studies did not clarify whether increased MMP-1 expression was caused by a disturbance of mtDNA integrity or whether it occurred independently. We have therefore generated a phenocopy of cells bearing large-scale deletions of mtDNA by gradually depleting the mtDNA from unirradiated human skin fibroblasts. Gradual depletion of mtDNA caused a gene expression profile, which was reminiscent of that observed in photoaged skin. Accordingly, in these cells an increased expression of MMP-1 without a concomitant change in tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 as well as a decreased expression of collagen type 1 alpha-1, that is, a gene involved in collagen de novo synthesis, was observed. This altered gene expression resulted from intracellular, mitochondria-derived oxidative stress. Our results support the concept that disruption of mt integrity, for example, by UV-induced mtDNA mutagenesis, is of pathogenetic relevance for photoaging of human skin.",0
19605696,Intracellular receptor for human host defense peptide LL-37 in monocytes,"The human cationic host defense peptide LL-37 has a broad range of immunomodulatory, anti-infective functions. A synthetic innate defense regulator peptide, innate defense regulator 1 (IDR-1), based conceptually on LL-37, was recently shown to selectively modulate innate immunity to protect against a wide range of bacterial infections. Using advanced proteomic techniques, ELISA, and Western blotting procedures, GAPDH was identified as a direct binding partner for LL-37 in monocytes. Enzyme kinetics and mobility shift studies also indicated LL-37 and IDR-1 binding to GAPDH. The functional relevance of GAPDH in peptide-induced responses was demonstrated by using gene silencing of GAPDH with small interfering RNA (siRNA). Previous studies have established that the induction of chemokines and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 are critical immunomodulatory functions in the anti-infective properties of LL-37 and IDR-1, and these functions are modulated by the MAPK p38 pathway. Consistent with that, this study demonstrated the importance of the GAPDH interactions with these peptides since gene silencing of GAPDH resulted in impaired p38 MAPK signaling, downstream chemokine and cytokine transcriptional responses induced by LL-37 and IDR-1, and LL-37-induced cytokine production. Bioinformatic analysis, using InnateDB, of the major interacting partners of GAPDH indicated the likelihood that this protein can impact on innate immune pathways including p38 MAPK. Thus, this study has demonstrated a novel function for GAPDH as a mononuclear cell receptor for human cathelicidin LL-37 and immunomodulatory IDR-1 and conclusively demonstrated its relevance in the functioning of cationic host defense peptides.",1
9843214,Alleles of APC modulate the frequency and classes of mutations that lead to colon polyps,"Most inherited mutant alleles of the adenomatosis polyposis coli gene (APC) cause the appearance of large numbers of colon polyps, the familial polyposis syndrome. (These mutant alleles are designated APCp alleles.) A subset of APC mutations, the attenuated or APC(AP) alleles, predispose to only a few colon polyps. This leads to the hypothesis that if mutation of the inherited normal allele is rate limiting in polyp development, the increased number of polyps associated with the APCp allele indicates that the frequency of mutations that can lead to polyp formation is higher among APCp carriers than among APC(AP) carriers. We have previously suggested that the APC protein might modulate the frequency of mutations, such as loss of heterozygosity (LOH), necessary for colon polyp formation. We thus reasoned that tumours from patients who carry an APC(AP) allele might show a reduced frequency of LOH compared with tumours from patients who carry an APCp allele. Loss of AAPC mutant alleles is designated as LOH(AP). Screening of tumours from APC(AP) carriers revealed a reduction of LOH compared with that of an unselected group of polyposis patients. In fact, no loss of the inherited APC(N) allele was observed, although sequencing showed that the inherited APC(N) allele had frequently undergone point mutations and small deletions in the tumours. A low frequency loss of the inherited APC(AP) allele was seen. These findings support the suggestion that the APC(AP) allele has residual gene activity and that this activity modulates the spectrum and frequency of mutations that lead to adenoma formation.",1
8988174,Delayed early embryonic lethality following disruption of the murine cyclin A2 gene,"In higher eukaryotes, cell cycle progression is controlled by cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks) complexed with cyclins. A-type cyclins are involved at both G1/S and G2/M transitions of the cell cycle. Cyclin A2 activates cdc2 (Cdk1) on passage into mitosis and Cdk2 at the G1/S transition. Antisense constructs, or antibodies directed against cyclin A2 block cultured mammalian cells at both of these transitions. In contrast, overexpression of cyclin A2 appears to advance S phase entry and confer anchorage-independent growth, and can lead to apoptosis. A second A-type cyclin, cyclin A1 has been described recently which, in the mouse, is expressed in germ cells but not somatic tissues. To address the possible redundancy between different cyclins in vivo and also the control of early embryonic cell cycles, we undertook the targeted deletion of the murine cyclin A2 gene. The homozygous null mutant is embryonically lethal, demonstrating that the cyclin A2 gene is essential. Surprisingly, homozygous null mutant embryos develop normally until post-implantation, around day 5.5 p.c. This observation may be explained by the persistence of a maternal pool of cyclin A2 protein until at least the blastocyst stage, or an unexpected role for cyclin A1 during early embryo development.",1
25691416,Expanding the phenotype of Timothy syndrome type 2: an adolescent with ventricular fibrillation but normal development,"Timothy syndrome is a rare multiorgan disorder with prolonged QTc interval, congenital heart defects, syndactyly, typical facial features and neurodevelopmental problems. Ventricular tachyarrhythmia is the leading cause of death at early age. Classical Timothy syndrome type 1 (TS1) results from a recurrent de novo CACNA1C mutation, G406R in exon 8 A. An atypical form of Timothy syndrome type 2 (TS2) is caused by mutations in G406R and G402S in the alternatively spliced exon 8. Only one individual for each exon 8 mutations has been described. In contrast to multiorgan disease caused by the mutation in G406R either in exon 8 A or 8, the G402S carrier manifested only an isolated cardiac phenotype with LQTS and cardiac arrest. We describe a teenage patient resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation and treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. She has no other organ manifestations, no syndactyly, normal neurodevelopment and her QTc has ranged between 440-480 ms. There is no family history of arrhythmias or sudden death. Targeted oligonucleotide-selective sequencing (OS-Seq) of channelopathy genes revealed a de novo substitution, G402S in exon 8 of CACNA1C. Direct sequencing of blood and saliva derived DNA showed an identical mutation peak suggesting ubiquitous expression in different tissues. The phenotype of our patient and the previously described patient show an isolated arrhythmia disease with no other organ manifestations of classical Timothy syndrome.",1
24484415,Burden of severe rotavirus disease leading to hospitalization assessed in a prospective cohort study in Sweden,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective cohort study was to estimate the burden of severe disease caused by rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis in Swedish children aged < 5 y. METHODS: Rotavirus-positive children admitted to hospitals serving 3 geographical regions with 155,838 children aged < 5 y, were offered inclusion in this 1-year study. Rotavirus strains identified were genotyped using multiplex PCR. Disease progression was documented through interviews and chart reviews. RESULTS: In total, 604 children with rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis were included in the study. Forty-nine of 604 (8.1%) fulfilled the criteria for nosocomial infection. The minimum incidence was 388 per 100,000, with significant variability between study regions, ranging from 280 to 542 per 100,000. In all regions, the peak season occurred in February-April, but the season start varied, with first cases observed in October in the eastern region and December in the northern region. Genotypes identified differed between the regions: G1[P8] was most prevalent in all regions (77%), while the most varied pattern was observed in the western region, with G1[P8] observed in 61%, G4[P8] in 13%, G9[P8] in 10%, G2[P4] in 8%, and G3[P8] in 8% of the children. The median age of hospitalized children was 14 months and the median total duration of diarrhoea was 6.9 days. Sixty-eight percent reported a temperature > 38.5 degrees C upon admission. Complications occurred in > 10% of the children, with hypertonic dehydration (32/604) and seizures (10/604) occurring most frequently. CONCLUSIONS: Rotaviruses may cause severe febrile acute gastroenteritis leading to dehydration requiring acute rehydration in hospital.

Case report,"Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is characterized by fever, rash, and joint pain and may lead to chronic arthritis. The cause of AOSD is unknown, and it is rare. In children, Still's Disease is called systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. We encountered a patient with adult-onset Still's disease following a severe sore throat and fever. The patient was a 17-year-old woman who consulted our hospital because of a sore throat and fever. She was admitted and treated with antibiotics, but the fever persisted. Laboratory parameters of inflammatory activity increased at an accelerated rate, and after ruling out sepsis, EBV-associated disease, and malignant lymphoma, a diagnosis of AOSD was made. Steroid therapy was very effective. When acute pharyngitis is observed in association with significant changes in laboratory parameters despite mild local symptoms, or when pharyngitis is observed in association with joint pain, continuous fever, and a rash, it is important to consider AOSI).",0
18462864,Expansion of the ARX spectrum,"We present four patients with ARX mutations and widely variant clinical presentations. Case 1, a female with a known ARX mutation has refractory infantile spasms and severe mental retardation. Case 2, a male presented with a neurodegenerative disorder and has a known ARX mutation likely de novo as mother is not a carrier. Cases 3 and 4, two siblings with a novel variant in ARX, which is not clearly pathogenic, have developmental delay. One of the siblings had a diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder, failure to thrive with severe feeding difficulties, intracranial hemorrhage, and seizures. There are very few affected females with ARX related infantile spasms. These cases expand the known phenotype of this emerging condition.",1
23448012,The effect of gamma sterilization on the insecticidal toxicity of engineered and conventional Bacillus thuringiensis strains,"This study evaluates the effect of gamma radiation on the spore activity, toxicity, and crystal structures of two engineered Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) strains, TnX and TnY, and the reference Bt strain HD-1. We attempted to identify dosages of cobalt-60 gamma radiation that would inactivate Bt spores but not affect its toxicity. In the radiation dosage range of 10-15 kilogray, no viable spore formation and no significant reduction of the efficiency of Bt against lepidopteran larvae were observed. However, further sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results show that the components of the protoxin are affected by gamma radiation and that some bands are absent after treatment compared with the controls; the change in the protoxin band pattern depends on the type of Bt strain. Furthermore, the spore crystal structure of three Bt strains was studied with scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that there are no changes in the size or shape of the treated Bt spores and crystals compared with the controls. The use of gamma radiation is effective to inactivate the spores of engineered Bt strains while preserving stable Bt toxicity against the target insect larvae.",0
8446106,"Substitution of valine-865 by methionine or leucine in the human androgen receptor causes complete or partial androgen insensitivity, respectively with distinct androgen receptor phenotypes","We have identified two different single nucleotide missense substitutions at valine-865 in exon 7 of the human androgen receptor (AR) gene in two families with androgen resistance. Val-->methionine is associated with the complete syndrome; Val-->leucine is associated with the partial form. In genital skin fibroblasts, both alterations yield a normal maximum binding capacity, but an increased apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for all androgens tested. In genital skin fibroblasts, Val865-Met A-R complexes have increased rate constants of dissociation with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, and the nonmetabolized ligands methyltrienolone or mibolerone (MB); their Val865-Leu counterparts have increased rates with methyltrienolone and MB, but not with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone. In transiently transfected COS-1 or PC-3 cells, Met865 AR is more severely impaired than Leu865 AR in transactivating two different androgen-responsive reporter constructs, thereby correlating with clinical phenotype. In COS-1 cells exposed to MB for 74 h, this relative impairment correlates with the relative instability of the MB-binding activity of each mutant AR, suggesting that their respective intrinsic transcriptional regulatory competence is normal. Notably, these mutant ARs lose significantly more MB-binding activity than immunoreactivity, suggesting that prolonged MB exposure induces them to adopt a nonbinding state. The position homologous to Val865 in the AR is occupied by Leu or Met in the three steroid receptors closely related to the AR. This indicates the structural subtlety that underlies the steroid-binding activity of different steroid receptors.",1
22089877,Understanding shifts in wildfire regimes as emergent threshold phenomena,"Ecosystems driven by wildfire regimes are characterized by fire size distributions resembling power laws. Existing models produce power laws, but their predicted exponents are too high and fail to capture the exponent's variation with geographic region. Here we present a minimal model of fire dynamics that describes fire spread as a stochastic birth-death process, analogous to stochastic population growth or disease spread and incorporating memory effects from previous fires. The model reproduces multiple regional patterns in fire regimes and allows us to classify different regions in terms of their proximity to a critical threshold. Transitions across this critical threshold imply abrupt and pronounced increases in average fire size. The model predicts that large regions in Canada are currently close to this transition and might be driven beyond the threshold in the future. We illustrate this point by analyzing the time series for large fires (>199 ha) from the Canadian Boreal Plains, found to have shifted from a subcritical regime to a critical regime in the recent past. By contrast to its predecessor, the model also suggests that a critical transition, and not self-organized criticality, underlies forest fire dynamics, with implications for other ecological systems exhibiting power-law-like patterns, in particular for their sensitivity to environmental change and control efforts.",0
15525512,Phosphorylation of Cdc20 by Bub1 provides a catalytic mechanism for APC/C inhibition by the spindle checkpoint,"To ensure the fidelity of chromosome segregation, the spindle checkpoint blocks the ubiquitin ligase activity of APC/C(Cdc20) in response to a single chromatid not properly attached to the mitotic spindle. Here we show that HeLa cells depleted for Bub1 by RNA interference are defective in checkpoint signaling. Bub1 directly phosphorylates Cdc20 in vitro and inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of APC/C(Cdc20) catalytically. A Cdc20 mutant with all six Bub1 phosphorylation sites removed is refractory to Bub1-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition in vitro. Upon checkpoint activation, Bub1 itself is hyperphosphorylated and its kinase activity toward Cdc20 is stimulated. Ectopic expression of the nonphosphorylatable Cdc20 mutant allows HeLa cells to escape from mitosis in the presence of spindle damage. Therefore, Bub1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc20 is required for proper checkpoint signaling. We speculate that inhibition of APC/C(Cdc20) by Bub1 in a catalytic fashion may partly account for the exquisite sensitivity of the spindle checkpoint.",1

20719861,Identification by whole-genome resequencing of gene defect responsible for severe hypercholesterolemia,"Whole-genome sequencing is a potentially powerful tool for the diagnosis of genetic diseases. Here, we used sequencing-by-ligation to sequence the genome of an 11-month-old breast-fed girl with xanthomas and very high plasma cholesterol levels (1023 mg/dl). Her parents had normal plasma cholesterol levels and reported no family history of hypercholesterolemia, suggesting either an autosomal recessive disorder or a de novo mutation. Known genetic causes of severe hypercholesterolemia were ruled out by sequencing the responsible genes (LDLRAP, LDLR, PCSK9, APOE and APOB), and sitosterolemia was ruled out by documenting a normal plasma sitosterol:cholesterol ratio. Sequencing revealed 3 797 207 deviations from the reference sequence, of which 9726 were nonsynonymous single-nucleotide substitutions. A total of 9027 of the nonsynonymous substitutions were present in dbSNP or in 21 additional individuals from whom complete exonic sequences were available. The 699 novel nonsynonymous substitutions were distributed among 604 genes, 23 of which were single-copy genes that each contained 2 nonsynonymous substitutions consistent with an autosomal recessive model. One gene, ABCG5, had two nonsense mutations (Q16X and R446X). This finding indicated that the infant has sitosterolemia. Thus, whole-genome sequencing led to the diagnosis of a known disease with an atypical presentation. Diagnosis was confirmed by the finding of severe sitosterolemia in a blood sample obtained after the infant had been weaned. These findings demonstrate that whole-genome (or exome) sequencing can be a valuable aid to diagnose genetic diseases, even in individual patients.",1
24081612,"Characterization of two tomato AP2/ERF genes, SlCRF1 and SlCRF2 in hormone and stress responses","KEY MESSAGE: SlCRF1 and SlCRF2 are expressed throughout the plant, prominently in vascular tissue. Each SlCRF has a distinct pattern of cytokinin induction and regulation by abiotic stresses in different organs. Cytokinin is an essential plant hormone involved in the regulation of many growth and developmental processes. While many cytokinin signaling pathway components have been well characterized, the cytokinin response factors (CRFs) that form a branch of this pathway are less well understood. This study examines the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum (L.)) CRF genes, SlCRF1 and SlCRF2 presenting a detailed and novel characterization of their developmental expression patterns, transcriptional regulation by hormones particularly cytokinin, and response to abiotic stresses. Both SlCRF1 and SlCRF2 were predominantly expressed in vasculature in tissues throughout the plant, with an overall trend for greater SlCRF2 expression in younger organs. Hormone regulation of SlCRF1 and SlCRF2 transcripts is primarily by cytokinin, which induced both SlCRFs in different organs over a range of developmental stages. The strongest cytokinin induction was found in leaves, with SlCRF2 induced to a higher level than SlCRF1. Examination of SlCRF transcripts during abiotic stress responses revealed that SlCRF1 and SlCRF2 have distinct patterns of regulation from each other and between leaves and roots. Novel connections between SlCRFs and stresses were found in particular including a strong induction of SlCRF1 by cold stress and a strong induction of SlCRF2 by oxidative stress in roots and unique patterns of induction/repression linking both SlCRFs to drought stress and response during recovery. Overall, this study provides a clear picture of SlCRF1 and SlCRF2 expression patterns across tissues during development and in response to cytokinin and specific stresses, indicating their importance in plant growth and environmental responses.",0
11356306,Differential effects of chlorpromazine on ionotropic glutamate receptors in cultured rat hippocampal neurons,"The effect of a widely used phenothiazine, chlorpromazine (CPZ) on ionotropic glutamate receptors was investigated using the patch-clamp technique in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors were insensitive to CPZ. The current responses to NMDA showed a wide range of variability of both the rate and the extent of desensitization. The responses characterized by fast and profound desensitization were strongly inhibited by 30 microM CPZ. The effectiveness of block of NMDA responses was clearly correlated with the apparent time constant of the desensitization onset. The extent of desenstitization was found to be increased by CPZ. We conclude that CPZ inhibits the NMDA receptors and propose that the sensibility to CPZ may depend both on the subunit composition and on the state of receptor modulation by intracellular factors.",0
9244431,Determination of the genomic structure of the XNP/ATRX gene encoding a potential zinc finger helicase,"The XNP/ATR-X gene is involved in several X-linked mental retardation phenotypes: the ATR-X syndrome, the Juberg-Marsidi syndrome, and some severe mental retardation phenotypes without alpha-thalassemia. Using a vectorette strategy, we have identified and sequenced the intron/exon boundaries of this gene. The gene is composed of 35 exons. It encodes a potential protein of 2492 amino acids. A search of the databases identified three zinc finger motifs within the 5' end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues indicated that an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6 is occurring. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is predominantly expressed in embryonic tissues. These data led us to search for mutations in the 5' region in ATRX patients without other mutations in the 3' region. In one patient a mutation was found in which part of exon 7 was removed from the XNP transcript, as a result of a mutation creating a novel splice site that is substituted for the natural splice site. This new splicing event removed one zinc finger motif. This is the first example of a mutation in XNP within the 5' coding region. It suggests that mutations will be predominantly found in the helicase region as well as in the zinc finger regions and leads us to propose a large screening of additional patients.",1

Nurses provided patient education (mostly by telephone) to improve adherence and ability to communicate with physicians. Patients were contacted an average of two times per month. The findings after 2 years are not encouraging. Few programs improved patient behaviors, health, or quality of care. The treatment group had significantly fewer hospitalizations in only one program; no program reduced gross or net expenditures. However, effects may be observed when 4 years of followup are available and sample sizes increase.",0
10620133,Human elastase 1: evidence for expression in the skin and the identification of a frequent frameshift polymorphism,"Human pancreatic elastase 1 is a serine protease which maps to the chromosomal region 12q13 close to a locus for an autosomal dominant skin disease, diffuse nonepidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma, and was investigated as a possible candidate gene for this disorder. Expression of two elastase inhibitors, elafin and SLPI, has been related to several hyperproliferative skin conditions. elastase 1 is functionally silent in the human pancreas but elastase 1 expression at the mRNA level was detected in human cultured primary keratinocytes. Antibody staining localized the protein to the basal cell layer of the human epidermis at a number of sites including the palmoplanta. Sequencing of genomic DNA from individuals with/without the keratoderma revealed a sequence variant, which would result in a premature truncation of the protein. This sequence variant, however, did not segregate with the skin disease and, indeed, was found to occur at a relatively high frequency in the population. Individuals homozygous for the variant do not have any obvious skin abnormalities. Based on the analysis of the secondary structure of the translated putative protein, the truncation is unlikely to result in knock-out of the elastase, but may cause destabilization of the enzyme-inhibitor complex.",1
26290490,"The NEK1 interactor, C21ORF2, is required for efficient DNA damage repair","Defective DNA damage response is a threat to genome stability and a proven cause of tumorigenesis. C21ORF2 (chromosome 21 open reading frame 2) is a novel gene on chromosome 21, and the C21ORF2 protein is found to interact with NEK1. Earlier studies showed that C21ORF2 might be associated with some human genetic diseases including Down syndrome. However, the cellular functions of C21ORF2 remain unknown. In the present study, we reported that C21ORF2 affected cell proliferation after DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation, and DNA repair was less efficient in C21ORF2-depleted cells compared with control cells. However, C21ORF2-knockdown cells did not show defects in the activation of the G2-phase DNA damage checkpoint. Furthermore, homologous recombination, but not non-homologous end joining repair, was found to be impaired after C21ORF2 attenuation, which could be rescued by the overexpression of NEK1, indicating that C21ORF2 functions in the same pathway as NEK1 in DNA damage repair.",1
28521867,Effect of a single bout of aerobic exercise on high-fat meal-induced inflammation,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chronic low-grade inflammation is involved in the development of metabolic disorders including atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome. Aerobic exercise has been shown to be anti-inflammatory and attenuate postprandial blood lipids, however, the effect of exercise on postprandial inflammation remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the protective effect of a single bout of aerobic exercise against postprandial lipemia and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) inflammation and to evaluate associations with changes in the energy-sensing enzyme, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy male subjects (n=12, age=23+/-2, %Fat=19+/-2) reported to the laboratory following an overnight fast (12-14h) on two separate occasions for consumption of a high-fat meal (HFM). Participants completed an acute bout of aerobic exercise the afternoon prior to one of the HFM visits. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Results indicate that the single bout of moderate aerobic exercise increased AMPK signaling in PBMCs, as shown by increased phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (p-ACC). This may be due to decreases in the AMPK inhibitory kinases PKD and GSK3beta. Additionally, prior moderate intensity exercise decreased postprandial lipemia (PPL) and some mediators of the inflammatory pathway, such as p-NF-kappaB. These findings that acute aerobic exercise improves AMPK and NF-kappaB signaling in human PBMCs contribute support to the anti-inflammatory roles of exercise.",0
7562522,Distribution and pharmacokinetics of a potent peptide antagonist of parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related protein in the rat,"Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy results from the production by cancer cells of parathyroid hormone related protein that activates receptors in bone. Peptide antagonists that block parathyroid hormone receptors in vivo would be instrumental in the clinical treatment of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. We report the in vivo whole body distribution and blood plasma pharmacokinetics of the parathyroid hormone receptor antagonist [Nle8,18,D-Trp12,monoiodinated Tyr34]bPTH(7-34)amide to determine parameters that are likely to affect its administration regimen. A single intravenously injected dose of [Nle8,18,D-Trp12,monoiodinated Tyr34]bPTH(7-34)amide was rapidly cleared from blood plasma. The plasma concentration reaches a maximum at 10 min (Cmax = 1.93 +/- 0.27% of total injected CPM/ml), and the intact PTH derivative was detectable in plasma by HPLC analysis at this time. In vivo binding to plasma proteins was noncovalent. The peptide was rapidly cleared from blood by the liver, and more slowly by the kidney. Radiolabel was detected in excreted feces at 8 hr, but the preferred route of excretion was renal as judged by significant counts in excreted urine. Absorption of labeled peptide by skin and bone was sustained. Strong and sustained absorption also occurred in the vas deferens, seminal vesicle and hypothalamus. Given the rapid clearance of antagonist, multiple or sustained dosing schemes might be necessary to achieve the desired pharmacological effect. The high counts in liver at early time points after i.v. injection suggest that other routes of administration that do not bypass the hepatic first-pass effect would result in very low blood levels of drug.",0
8995400,Organization and differential expression of the human monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 receptor gene. Evidence for the role of the carboxyl-terminal tail in receptor trafficking,"Two forms of the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 receptors (the type A monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) receptor CCR-2A and the type B MCP-1 receptor (CCR-2B) have been recently cloned and found to differ only in their terminal carboxyl tails. Here, we report that the two isoforms are alternatively spliced variants of a single MCP-1 receptor gene. Sequencing of the gene revealed that the 47-amino acid carboxyl tail of CCR2B was located in the same exon as the seven transmembrane domains of the receptor, and the 61-amino acid tail of CCR2A was in a downstream exon. Examination of freshly isolated human monocytes by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that CCR2B was the predominant isoform and that message levels of both CCR2A and CCR2B decreased as the monocytes differentiated into macrophages. In stably transfected cell lines, CCR2B trafficked well to the cell surface, but CCR2A was found predominantly in the cytoplasm. Equilibrium binding studies revealed that those CCR2A receptors that successfully trafficked to the cell surface bound MCP-1 with high affinity (Kd = 310 pM), similar to CCR2B. In signaling studies, both CCR2A and CCR2B mediated agonist-dependent calcium mobilization, as well as inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Creation of chimeras between CCR2A and the human thrombin receptor revealed that the cytoplasmic retention of CCR2A was due to its terminal carboxyl tail. Progressive truncation of the carboxyl tail indicated that a cytoplasmic retention signal(s) was located between residues 316 and 349. These data indicate that the alternatively spliced form of the human MCP-1 receptor (CCR2A) binds MCP-1 with high affinity and is a functional receptor and that expression at the cell surface is controlled by amino acid sequences located in the terminal carboxyl tail.",1
18772437,Human-specific gain of function in a developmental enhancer,"Changes in gene regulation are thought to have contributed to the evolution of human development. However, in vivo evidence for uniquely human developmental regulatory function has remained elusive. In transgenic mice, a conserved noncoding sequence (HACNS1) that evolved extremely rapidly in humans acted as an enhancer of gene expression that has gained a strong limb expression domain relative to the orthologous elements from chimpanzee and rhesus macaque. This gain of function was consistent across two developmental stages in the mouse and included the presumptive anterior wrist and proximal thumb. In vivo analyses with synthetic enhancers, in which human-specific substitutions were introduced into the chimpanzee enhancer sequence or reverted in the human enhancer to the ancestral state, indicated that 13 substitutions clustered in an 81-base pair module otherwise highly constrained among terrestrial vertebrates were sufficient to confer the human-specific limb expression domain.",1
31337082,Perspective of Molecular Diagnosis in Healthcare: From Barcode to Pattern Recognition,"Barcode technology has a broad spectrum of applications including healthcare, food security, and environmental monitoring, due to its ability to encode large amounts of information. With the rapid development of modern molecular research, barcodes are utilized as a reporter with different molecular combinations to label many biomolecular targets, including genomic and metabolic elements, even with multiplex targeting. Along with the advancements in barcoded bioassay, the improvements of various designs of barcode components, encoding and decoding strategies, and their portable adoption are indispensable in satisfying multiple purposes, such as medical confirmation and point-of-care (POC) testing. This perspective briefly discusses the current direction and progress of barcodes development and provides a hypothesis for barcoded bioassay in the near future.",0
32373604,Multi-Material Implants for Temporomandibular Joint Disc Repair: Tailored Additive Manufacturing Production,"Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) affect a substantial percentage of the population, and the resources spent on their treatment are considerable. Despite the worldwide efforts around Tissue Engineering of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc, a proper implant offering a long-term solution for TMD was not yet developed. To contribute to these efforts, this work is focused on the research and development of implants for TMJ disc regeneration. Scaffolds and hydrogels mimicking the TMJ disc of black Merino sheep were produced using different materials, poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), and as a multi-material structure. Different parameters of the scaffold manufacturing were assessed: the influence of processing temperatures, filament diameter, and biological environment. Moreover, two multi-material approaches were also assessed, scaffold with a hydrogel shell and scaffold with a hydrogel core. It was found that increasing temperature, the scaffolds' porosity decreases, increasing their compressive modulus. Decreasing the filament size (300 to 200 mum) decreases the compressive modulus to almost half of the initial value. Scaffolds with 200 mum filaments are the ones with a closer modulus to the native disc and their properties are maintained under hydrated conditions. The introduction of a hydrogel core in these scaffolds presented better mechanical properties to TMJ disc substitution.",0
30078963,Occurrence and characterization of hyperviscous K1 and K2 serotype in Klebsiella pneumoniae,"BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae causes both nosocomial and community-associated infections. Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP), new variant of K. pneumoniae, can cause invasive infections in young healthy individuals as well as in the immunocompromised population. Hypervirulent strains frequently belong to capsular serotypes K1 or K2. Emergence of antimicrobial resistance in hvKP is a cause for concern. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The present study was done to detect the K1 and K2 serotypes among clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae, spectrum of infections caused by them and presence of common beta-lactamases encoding genes in them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 370 isolates of K. pneumoniae, isolated from various clinical samples over a period of 1 year was included in this study. Antibiotic susceptibility testing to various classes of antimicrobials was done as per Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines. The presence of K2A (specific to serotype K2), magA (specific to serotype K1), and rmpA genes was detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM, SHV, and CTX-M), plasmid-mediated AmpCs (MOX, CIT, DHA, ACC, EBC, and FOX), and carbapenemase genes (IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48) were also determined by PCR. RESULTS: Among the 370 isolates, 8 harbored K2A gene and one harbored magA. rmpA gene was detected in three isolates along with K1 or K2 serotypes. Seven K2A-positive isolates were resistant to one or more classes of antimicrobials. The studied ESBL genes were present in four isolates. Two isolates harbored carbapenemase genes (NDM-1, OXA-48) along with ESBLs. CONCLUSION: K2 serotype is more prevalent among hvKP isolates. They can harbor ESBLs and Carbapenemase genes. K1 serotype is rather uncommon in K. pneumoniae. Acquisition of multidrug-resistant genes by these strains adds to their virulence and limits the treatment options.",0
30941134,A DNA Vaccine Encoding the VAA Gene of Vibrio anguillarum Induces a Protective Immune Response in Flounder,"Vibrio anguillarum is a pathogenic bacterium that infects flounder resulting in significant losses in the aquaculture industry. The VAA protein previously identified in flounder is associated with a role in immune protection within these fish. In the present study, a recombinant DNA plasmid encoding the VAA gene of V. anguillarum was constructed and its potential as a DNA vaccine, to prevent the infection of V. anguillarum in flounder fish, investigated. We verified the expression of the VAA protein both in vitro in cell lines and in vivo in flounder fish. The protective effects of pcDNA3.1-VAA (pVAA) were analyzed by determination of the percentage of sIgM(+), CD4-1(+), CD4-2(+), CD8beta(+) lymphocytes, and the production of VAA-specific antibodies in flounder following their immunization with the DNA vaccine. Histopathological changes in immune related tissues, bacterial load, and relative percentage survival rates of flounder post-challenge with V. anguillarum, were all investigated to assess the efficacy of the pVAA DNA vaccine candidate. Fish intramuscularly immunized with pVAA showed a significant increase in CD4-1(+), CD4-2(+), and CD8beta(+) T lymphocytes at days 9, 11, and 14 post-vaccination, reaching peak T-cell levels at days 11 or 14 post-immunization. The percentage of sIgM(+) lymphocytes reached peak levels at weeks 4-5 post-immunization. Specific anti-V. anguillarum or anti-rVAA antibodies were induced in inoculated fish at days 28-35 post-immunization. The liver of vaccinated flounder exhibited only slight histopathological changes compared with a significant pathology observed in control immunized fish. Additionally, a lower bacterial burden in the liver, spleen, and kidney were observed in pVAA protected fish in response to bacterial challenge, compared with pcDNA3.1 vector control injected fish. Moreover, the pVAA vaccine confers a relative percentage survival of 50.00% following V. anguillarum infection. In summary, this is the first study indicating an initial induction of the T lymphocyte response, followed by B lymphocyte induction of specific antibodies as a result of DNA immunization of flounder. This signifies the important potential of pVAA as a DNA vaccine candidate for the control of V. anguillarum infection.",0
11162558,MDC-9 (ADAM-9/Meltrin gamma) functions as an adhesion molecule by binding the alpha(v)beta(5) integrin,"MDC-9 is a widely expressed member of the metalloproteinase/disintegrin/cysteine-rich protein family. The disintegrin domain of MDC-9 lacks an RGD motif but has recently been reported to bind the alpha(6)beta(1) integrin; however, it is unclear whether MDC-9 can bind other integrins. In the present study myeloma cells, but not lymphoblastoid cells, were shown to bind to immobilised, recombinantly expressed MDC-9 disintegrin domain (A9dis). Binding was divalent cation-dependent, being supported by Mn(2+) and Ca(2+). Adhesion of myeloma cells to A9dis was completely inhibited by an antibody to the alpha(v)beta(5) integrin but not by antibodies to other subunits. RGD-containing peptides had no effect on binding, suggesting that MDC-9 interacts with alpha(v)beta(5) in an RGD-independent manner. Flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that myeloma cells, but not lymphoblastoid cells, expressed alpha(v)beta(5) on the cell membrane. These data indicated that the disintegrin domain of MDC-9 can function as an adhesion molecule by interacting with an alpha(v)beta(5) integrin.",1
7720071,Mutations in the proteolytic enzyme calpain 3 cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A,"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) are a group of inherited diseases whose genetic etiology has yet to be elucidated. The autosomal recessive forms (LGMD2) constitute a genetically heterogeneous group with LGMD2A mapping to chromosome 15q15.1-q21.1. The gene encoding the muscle-specific calcium-activated neutral protease 3 (CANP3) large subunit is located in this region. This cysteine protease belongs to the family of intracellular calpains. Fifteen nonsense, splice site, frameshift, or missense calpain mutations cosegregate with the disease in LGMD2A families, six of which were found within La Reunion island patients. A digenic inheritance model is proposed to account for the unexpected presence of multiple independent mutations in this small inbred population. Finally, these results demonstrate an enzymatic rather than a structural protein defect causing a muscular dystrophy, a defect that may have regulatory consequences, perhaps in signal transduction.",1
1756970,Optimised cDNA size selection and cloning procedure for the construction of representative plasmid cDNA libraries,"Plasmid libraries are more versatile than phage libraries since they allow expression cloning in eukaryotic systems. However, high numbers of primary clones are sometimes difficult to obtain and more efficient transformation procedures are often required. In this paper, a detailed protocol is presented, for the construction of large plasmid libraries from ng quantities of cDNA, based on a highly efficient transformation step. Drop dialysis and electroporation are optimised: complete ligase removal and yeast tRNA addition before dialysis appear critical, while exclusive use of double-distilled water as well as rapid preparation of fresh cells provide excellent electroporation yields. A novel, simple and flexible cDNA size selection procedure is also presented, based on sucrose density gradient. Two libraries were constructed using an expression vector for mammalian cells (pCDM8) and its Escherichia coli host strain (MC1061[p3]). Numbers of 2 to 10 x 10(6) primary transformants were obtained from 1 microgram of poly(A)+ RNA. Up to 85% of the clones had inserts and half of the inserts were larger than 1.5 kb.",0
11836299,Role of calpain-10 gene variants in familial type 2 diabetes in Caucasians,"The calpain-10 gene (CAPN10) has been implicated in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) susceptibility by both linkage and association in a Hispanic population from Starr County Texas. Common intronic variants seem to alter CAPN10 mRNA levels and were associated with insulin resistance but not diabetes in Pima Indians. The role of these variants in Caucasian populations is less clear. We found some evidence for linkage of T2DM to chromosome 2q approximately 20 cM proximal to the NIDDM1/CAPN10 locus. To test the hypothesis that CAPN10 is a diabetes susceptibility locus in Caucasian families at high risk for T2DM, we examined the influence of the three previously implicated CAPN10 variants on both diabetes risk and measures of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. We genotyped approximately 700 members of 63 families for 3 variants (SNP-43, SNP-19, and SNP-63). We tested each variant separately and as haplotype combinations for altered transmission from parents to affected children (transmission disequilibrium test), and we tested for an effect of each variant individually on measures of glucose and insulin during a glucose tolerance test in nondiabetic family members. Finally, we looked for an effect of each variant on measures of insulin sensitivity (S(I)) and insulin secretion estimated by frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance test and Minimal Model analysis. We could not confirm an increase in risk for T2DM susceptibility for any variant or for any haplotype combination, although we found marginal evidence for an increased risk of the 111/221 haplotype combination (P = 0.036) after ascertainment correction. However, both SNP-19 and SNP-63 increased fasting and/or postchallenge insulin levels, consistent with reduced insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, SNP-19 had modest effects on insulin sensitivity measured by homeostatic model, and on postchallenge glucose. The reduction in insulin sensitivity was confirmed by analysis of the subset of individuals who underwent iv glucose tolerance tests, where SNP-19 significantly altered the insulin sensitivity index. CAPN10 cannot be considered a major diabetes susceptibility gene in our population and seems unlikely to explain the observed linkage findings. However, CAPN10 influences insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in nondiabetic members of kindreds at high risk for T2DM.",1

30545285,Vertebrate SLRP family evolution and the subfunctionalization of osteoglycin gene duplicates in teleost fish,"BACKGROUND: Osteoglycin (OGN, a.k.a. mimecan) belongs to cluster III of the small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRP) of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In vertebrates OGN is a characteristic ECM protein of bone. In the present study we explore the evolution of SLRP III and OGN in teleosts that have a skeleton adapted to an aquatic environment. RESULTS: The SLRP gene family has been conserved since the separation of chondrichthyes and osteichthyes. Few gene duplicates of the SLRP III family exist even in the teleosts that experienced a specific whole genome duplication. One exception is ogn for which duplicate copies were identified in fish genomes. The ogn promoter sequence and in vitro mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) cultures suggest the duplicate ogn genes acquired divergent functions. In gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) ogn1 was up-regulated during osteoblast and myocyte differentiation in vitro, while ogn2 was severely down-regulated during bone-derived MSCs differentiation into adipocytes in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the phylogenetic analysis indicates that the SLRP III family in vertebrates has been under conservative evolutionary pressure. The retention of the ogn gene duplicates in teleosts was linked with the acquisition of different functions. The acquisition by OGN of functions other than that of a bone ECM protein occurred early in the vertebrate lineage.",0
25156970,Seasonal variations in developmental competence and relative abundance of gene transcripts in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) oocytes,"Hot season is a major constraint to production and reproduction in buffaloes. The present work aimed to investigate the effect of season on ovarian function, developmental competence, and the relative abundance of gene expression in buffalo oocytes. Three experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, pairs of buffalo ovaries were collected during cold season (CS, autumn and winter) and hot season (HS, spring and summer), and the number of antral follicles was recorded. Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were aspirated and evaluated according to their morphology into four Grades. In experiment 2, Grade A and B COCs collected during CS and HS were in vitro matured (IVM) for 24 hours under standard conditions at 38.5  degrees C in a humidified air of 5% CO2. After IVM, cumulus cells were removed and oocytes were fixed, stained with 1% aceto-orcein, and evaluated for nuclear configuration. In vitro matured buffalo oocytes harvested during CS or HS were in vitro fertilized (IVF) using frozen-thawed buffalo semen and cultured in vitro to the blastocyst stage. In experiment 3, buffalo COCs and in vitro matured oocytes were collected during CS and HS, and then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for gene expression analysis. Total RNA was extracted from COCs and in vitro matured oocytes, and complementary DNA was synthesized; quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction was performed for eight candidate genes including GAPDH, ACTB, B2M, GDF9, BMP15, HSP70, and SOD2. The results indicated that HS significantly (P < 0.01) decreased the number of antral follicles and the number of COCs recovered per ovary. The number of Grade A, B, and C COCs was lower (P < 0.05) during HS than CS. In vitro maturation of buffalo oocytes during HS significantly (P < 0.01) reduced the number of oocytes reaching the metaphase II stage and increased the percentage of degenerated oocytes compared with CS. Oocytes collected during HS also showed signs of cytoplasmic degeneration. After IVF, cleavage rate was lower (P < 0.01) for oocytes collected during HS, and the percentage of oocytes arrested at the two-cell stage was higher (P < 0.01) than oocytes IVF during CS. Oocytes matured during CS showed a higher (P < 0.01) blastocyst rate than those matured during HS. Also, COCs recovered in HS showed significant (P < 0.05) upregulation of HSP70 mRNA expression compared with those recovered in CS. For in vitro matured oocytes, CS down regulated the transcript abundance of ACTB and upregulated GAPDH and HSP70 mRNA levels compared with HS condition. In conclusion, HS could impair buffalo fertility by reducing the number of antral follicles and oocyte quality. In vitro maturation of buffalo oocytes during HS impairs their nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation, fertilization, and subsequent embryo development to the morula and blastocyst stages. This could be in part because of the altered gene expression found in COCs and in vitro matured oocytes.",0
12859760,Assessment of bismuth thiols and conventional disinfectants on drinking water biofilms,"AIMS: Biofilms in water distribution systems represent a far more significant reservoir of micro-organisms than the water phase. Biofilms are (i) resistant to disinfectants, (ii) nuclei for microbial regrowth, (iii) a refuge for pathogens, (iv) accompanied by taste and odour problems, and (v) corrode surfaces. The effects of the current strategies for disinfection of drinking water systems in large buildings (chlorination, copper and silver ionization, and hyper-heating) were compared with a new generation of bismuth thiol (BT) biocides. METHODS AND RESULTS: Multispecies biofilms were treated with 0.8 mg l(-1) of free chlorine, 400 and 40 microg l(-1) of copper and silver ions, respectively, at 55 and 70 degrees C, and bismuth-2,3-dimercaptopropanol (BisBAL). Furthermore, the effect of combined heat and BisBAL on planktonic cell viability was examined in monoculture using Escherichia coli suspensions. Inactivation rates for BisBAL were similar to copper-silver ions, where the effects were slower than for free chlorine or temperature. The BisBAL effect on E. coli monocultures was augmented greatly by increasing temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: Like copper-silver ions, BTs show more persistent residual effects than chlorine and hyper-heating in water systems. BT efficiency increased with temperature. Like copper-silver ions, BT action is relatively slow. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: BT presents a new approach to containing water biofilms. BT action is not as rapid, but is more thorough than chlorine, and less caustic. BTs may also be more efficacious in hot water systems. At sub-minimum inhibition concentration levels, BTs uniquely inhibit bacterial exopolysaccharide, thereby retarding biofilm formation. Thus, the combination of bactericidal and residual effects may prevent slime build-up in hot water systems.",0
15131264,Regulation of an ATG7-beclin 1 program of autophagic cell death by caspase-8,"Caspases play a central role in apoptosis, a well-studied pathway of programmed cell death. Other programs of death potentially involving necrosis and autophagy may exist, but their relation to apoptosis and mechanisms of regulation remains unclear. We define a new molecular pathway in which activation of the receptor-interacting protein (a serine-threonine kinase) and Jun amino-terminal kinase induced cell death with the morphology of autophagy. Autophagic death required the genes ATG7 and beclin 1 and was induced by caspase-8 inhibition. Clinical therapies involving caspase inhibitors may arrest apoptosis but also have the unanticipated effect of promoting autophagic cell death.",1

The results of hemagglutination and neuraminidase-inhibition tests with monospecific antisera to the isolated surface antigens showed that the isolates possessed Hav4 hemagglutinin and Nav1 neuraminidase subunits both of which were closely related to the corresponding antigens of A/duck/Czech/56 (Hav4 Nav1).",0
26279170,Clinical evaluation of the efficacy and safety of fractional bipolar radiofrequency for the treatment of moderate to severe acne scars,"Several treatment modalities are used for the treatment of acne scars with variable results. Recent studies showed that fractional radiofrequency may be an effective treatment modality for acne scars. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and patient satisfaction of fractional bipolar radiofrequency (RF), the eTwo system (Syneron Candela Ltd., Yokneam, Israel) for treating acne scars. Twelve patients with moderate to severe acne scars received 3-5 treatments with the Sublative fractionated bipolar RF applicator of the eTwo device at 1-month intervals. Patients were evaluated clinically and photographically at each visit and 3 months after the final treatment. Very good improvement (at least one scale) was seen after completing the five treatments. The patient satisfaction survey (Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores) revealed that half (6 out of 12) of the patients reported to be satisfied with treatment results, while the other half reported to be very satisfied. Beyond the expected erythema and minimal scab formation in the treated areas, which was mild and transient, none of the participants reported any adverse events. The data presented here support the high efficacy and safety of fractionated bipolar RF for the aesthetic improvement of moderate to severe acne scars. ",0
9208847,Casper is a FADD- and caspase-related inducer of apoptosis,"Caspases are cysteine proteases that play a central role in apoptosis. Caspase-8 may be the first enzyme of the proteolytic cascade activated by the Fas ligand and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Caspase-8 is recruited to Fas and TNF receptor-1 (TNF-R1) through interaction of its prodomain with the death effector domain (DED) of the receptor-associating FADD. Here we describe a novel 55 kDa protein, Casper, that has sequence similarity to caspase-8 throughout its length. However, Casper is not a caspase since it lacks several conserved amino acids found in all caspases. Casper interacts with FADD, caspase-8, caspase-3, TRAF1, and TRAF2 through distinct domains. When overexpressed in mammalian cells, Casper potently induces apoptosis. A C-terminal deletion mutant of Casper inhibits TNF- and Fas-induced cell death, suggesting that Casper is involved in these apoptotic pathways.",1

Alcoholic women were retested 1 and 4 years later, and control women were retested 3 years later. At Year 1, 14 of 23 returners had maintained sobriety, but they did not perform significantly better than relapsers; the group as a whole continued to show deficits relative to age norms. By Year 4, 13 of 14 returners had maintained sobriety for more than 30 months; as a group, these women had returned to normal levels on tests of memory and psychomotor speed but remained impaired in standing balance.",0

21856291,"Human arylacetamide deacetylase is responsible for deacetylation of rifamycins: rifampicin, rifabutin, and rifapentine","Rifamycins such as rifampicin, rifabutin, and rifapentine are used for the treatment of tuberculosis and induce various drug-metabolizing enzymes. Rifamycins have been reported to be mainly deacetylated by esterase(s) expressed in human liver microsomes (HLM) to 25-deacetylrifamycins, but the responsible enzyme remained to be determined. In this study, we found that recombinant human arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) could efficiently deacetylate rifamycins, whereas human carboxylesterases, which are enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of many prodrugs, showed no activity. The involvement of AADAC in the deacetylation of rifamycins in HLM was verified by the similarities of the K(m) and K(i) values and the inhibitory characteristics between recombinant AADAC and HLM. Rifamycins exhibited potent cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells, but their 25-deacetylated metabolites did not. Luciferase assay using a reporter plasmid containing CYP3A4 direct repeat 3 and everted repeat 6 motifs revealed that 25-deacetylrifamycins have lesser potency to transactivate CYP3A4 compared with the parent drugs. Supporting these results, HepG2 cells infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing human AADAC showed low cytotoxicity and induction potency of CYP3A4 by rifamycins. In addition, CYP3A4 induction in human hepatocytes by rifamycins was increased by transfecting siRNA for human AADAC. Thus, we found that human AADAC was the enzyme responsible for the deacetylation of rifamycins and would affect the induction rate of drug-metabolizing enzymes by rifamycins and their induced hepatotoxicity.",1
11389039,"Human cathelicidin, hCAP-18, is processed to the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 by extracellular cleavage with proteinase 3","Cathelicidins are a family of antimicrobial proteins found in the peroxidase-negative granules of neutrophils. The known biologic functions reside in the C-terminus, which must be cleaved from the holoprotein to become active. Bovine and porcine cathelicidins are cleaved by elastase from the azurophil granules to yield the active antimicrobial peptides. The aim of this study was to identify the physiological setting for cleavage of the only human cathelicidin, hCAP-18, to liberate the antibacterial and cytotoxic peptide LL-37 and to identify the protease responsible for this cleavage. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that both hCAP-18 and azurophil granule proteins were present in the phagolysosome. Immunoblotting revealed no detectable cleavage of hCAP-18 in cells after phagocytosis. In contrast, hCAP-18 was cleaved to generate LL-37 in exocytosed material. Of the 3 known serine proteases from azurophil granules, proteinase 3 was solely responsible for cleavage of hCAP-18 after exocytosis. This is the first detailed study describing the generation of a human antimicrobial peptide from a promicrobicidal protein, and it demonstrates that the generation of active antimicrobial peptides from common proproteins occurs differently in related species.

1993898,Cholecystokinin modulates the release of dopamine from the anterior and posterior nucleus accumbens by two different mechanisms,"The effects of various cholecystokinin (CCK)-related peptides were investigated on 35 mM K(+)-stimulated endogenous dopamine release from slices of either anterior or posterior nucleus accumbens of the rat. CCK sulphated octapeptide (1-10 microM), but not pentagastrin or CCK unsulphated octapeptide, was found to cause a dose-dependent increase in the release from the posterior nucleus accumbens. This effect was blocked by low doses of the CCKA receptor antagonist L364,718 (10 nM) but not the CCKB receptor antagonist L365,260. In the anterior nucleus accumbens CCK sulphated octapeptide (1 microM) and CCK unsulphated octapeptide (0.1-1 microM) inhibited the dopamine release, and this effect was blocked by L365,260 (10-100 nM) but not by L364,718. These results suggest that CCK has a different effect on dopamine release from the anterior and posterior nucleus accumbens and that these effects are mediated by two different types of CCK receptor.",1
16037064,CCM1 and CCM2 protein interactions in cell signaling: implications for cerebral cavernous malformations pathogenesis,"Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are sporadically acquired or inherited vascular lesions of the central nervous system consisting of clusters of dilated thin-walled blood vessels that predispose individuals to seizures and stroke. Familial CCM is caused by mutations in KRIT1 (CCM1) or in malcavernin (CCM2), the murine ortholog of which was concurrently characterized as osmosensing scaffold for MEKK3 (OSM). The roles of the CCM proteins in the pathogenesis of the disorder remain largely unknown. Here, we use co-immunoprecipitation, fluorescence resonance energy transfer and subcellular localization strategies to show that the CCM1 gene product, KRIT1, interacts with the CCM2 gene product, malcavernin/OSM. Analogous to the established interactions of CCM1 and beta1 integrin with ICAP1, the CCM1/CCM2 association is dependent upon the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of CCM2. A familial CCM2 missense mutation abrogates the CCM1/CCM2 interaction, suggesting that loss of this interaction may be critical in CCM pathogenesis. CCM2 and ICAP1 bound to CCM1 via their respective PTB domains differentially influence the subcellular localization of CCM1. Furthermore, we expand upon the established involvement of CCM2 in the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling module by demonstrating that CCM1 associates with CCM2 and MEKK3 in a ternary complex. These data indicate that the genetic heterogeneity observed in familial CCM may reflect mutation of different molecular members of a coordinated signaling complex.",1

This article reviews the effects of these osteoinductive growth factors on bone healing as elucidated by both preclinical in vivo fracture and diaphyseal defect healing models.",0
11829142,Molecular cloning and functional analysis of a factor that binds to the proximal promoter of human angiotensinogen,"A significant association has been reported between a common variant in the angiotensinogen gene (AGT), allele T235, and essential hypertension. In subsequent work, it was found that another variant, the presence of an adenine instead of a guanine 6bp upstream from the initiation site of transcription, was in absolute linkage disequilibrium with T235. The nucleotide substitution at the -6 position affected the formation of DNA-protein complexes in gel mobility shift assays and the basal transcription of AGT in transactivation experiments. We have further examined the potential impact of this polymorphism on AGT promoter function. In ultraviolet cross-linking analysis. 150- and 75-kDa proteins bound to the AGT proximal promoter. The possible involvement of factors that bind to GC-rich domains, including Sp1, Sp3, and AP2, was not supported by gel mobility shift assays. Screening an expression library with a double-stranded DNA segment centered on -6 led to the isolation of cDNA clones encoding the YB1 protein. The specificity of the interaction of YB1 with the proximal promoter of AGT was verified by Southwestern blotting and gel mobility shift assays. In cotransfection experiments, YB1 reduced basal AGT promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Although these observations suggest a possible role for YB1 in modulating AGT expression, this function is likely to occur in the context of complex interactions involving other nuclear factors. The work illustrates the challenge of developing a molecular understanding of the relationship between common genetic variants and conditions that are only partly caused by them.",1
16024375,Multiple sperm storage organs facilitate female control of paternity,"It has been proposed that multiple sperm storage organs (spermathecae) could allow polyandrous females to control paternity. There is little conclusive evidence for this since insemination of individual spermathecae is generally not experimentally manipulable. Here, we examined sperm use patterns in the Australian redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti), which has paired, independent spermathecae. We assessed paternity when two rivals were forced to inseminate a single storage organ or opposite storage organs. When males inseminated a single spermatheca, mean paternity of the female's first mate was 79.8% (median 89.4%), and 38% of first mates achieved 100% paternity. In contrast, when males inseminated opposite organs, the mean paternity of the first mate was 49.3% (median 49.9%), only 10% of males achieved complete precedence, and paternity was normally distributed, suggesting sperm mixing. Males responded to this difference by avoiding previously inseminated female reproductive tracts. Complete sperm precedence can only be achieved if females permit males to copulate with both reproductive tracts. Females often cannibalize smaller males during their first copulation, thus limiting their paternity to 50%. These data show that multiple sperm storage organs can increase female control of paternity.",0

VsBac-Y9) is a symbiont living with the dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungus Veronaeopsis simplex Y34. Co-inoculation of Rhizobium sp. VsBac-Y9 with V. simplex Y34 improves the fungal colonization of tomato roots, resulting in a significant increase in aboveground biomass. This study sequenced the complete genome of this V. simplex-helper bacterium using the PacBio and Illumina MiSeq platforms. Hybrid assembly using SPAdes outputted a circular chromosome, a linear chromid, and a circular plasmid for a total genome 5,321,211 bp in size with a G + C content of 59.2%. Analysis of concatenated housekeeping genes (atpD-dnaK-groEL-lepA-recA-rpoB-thrE) and calculation of average nucleotide identity, showed that VsBac-Y9 was affiliated with the species Agrobacterium pusense (syn. Rhizobium pusense). Genome analysis revealed that A. pusense VsBac-Y9 contains a series of genes responsible for the host interactions with both fungus and plant. Such genomic information will provide new insights into developing co-inoculants of endophytic fungus and its symbiotic bacterium in future agricultural innovation.",0

29871492,Preferences for suicide prevention strategies among university students in Japan: a cross-sectional study using full-profile conjoint analysis,"In Japan, implementation of suicide prevention policies is mainly supported by public funds. However, it is unclear what kinds of suicide prevention strategies people prefer. We conducted a survey to clarify people's preferences regarding suicide prevention strategies adopted in Japan. This was a cross-sectional self-administered questionnaire survey. Participants were recruited through a lecture held by the first author at their university. We distributed questionnaires to 324 people present at the lecture; 249 completed questionnaires were included in the final analysis. We estimated suicide prevention strategy preferences using full profile conjoint analysis. For all six prevention strategies, the inclusion of each strategy in the policy profile was statistically significantly related to the positive evaluation of the overall policy profile. Marginal Willingness to Pay (MWTP) for restriction of access to means showed the highest value of the six suicide prevention strategies. MWTP was the lowest for public awareness activities. Preferred suicide prevention strategies in Japan are restriction of access to means and enhancement of psychiatric services. The results of this study indicate the strategies that are preferred have a high level of evidence of suicide prevention and do not directly intervene in a person's free will to die by suicide.",0
24681347,KCNE2 modulates cardiac L-type Ca(2+) channel,"KCNE2 plays an important role in maintaining cardiac electrical stability. Mutations in KCNE2 have been linked to long-QT syndrome (LQT6) and atrial fibrillation/short QT syndrome. It has been suggested that KCNE2 has the most promiscuity of function which can interact with multiple-subunits of voltage-dependent cation channels and modulate their functions. However, whether KCNE2 regulates voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2)(+) channel (LCC) remains unknown. This study investigated the possible role of KCNE2 in regulating cardiac LCCs and the pathophysiological relevance of this regulation. We found that overexpression of KCNE2 in Sprague-Dawley rat cardiomyocytes decreased L-type Ca(2+)current (ICa,L), whereas KCNE2 knockdown by RNA interference increased ICa,L. Upregulation of KCNE2 caused a slight positive shift of the voltage-dependent activation and a negative shift of the steady-state voltage-dependent inactivation, and slowed the recovery from inactivation of ICa,L, while knockdown of KCNE2 had the contrary effects. Similar regulation of ICa,L magnitude had been observed in transfected HEK 293 cells. Coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization assays in both cardiomyocytes and the transfected cell line suggest that Cav1.2 physically interacted with KCNE2. Deletion of the N-terminal inhibitory module (NTI) of Cav1.2 results in the large loss of KCNE2 regulation of ICa,L and interaction with Cav1.2. Furthermore, we found that the familial atrial fibrillation related KCNE2 mutation R27C enhanced the effect of KCNE2 on suppressing ICa,L. Taken together, our findings indicate that KCNE2 modulates ICa,L by regulating NTI function of Cav1.2. The KCNE2 mutation R27C may induce familial atrial fibrillation partially through enhancing the suppression of ICa,L. ",1
12677556,Genetic interaction of BBS1 mutations with alleles at other BBS loci can result in non-Mendelian Bardet-Biedl syndrome,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disorder caused by mutations in at least seven loci (BBS1-7), five of which are cloned (BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS6, and BBS7). Genetic and mutational analyses have indicated that, in some families, a combination of three mutant alleles at two loci (triallelic inheritance) is necessary for pathogenesis. To date, four of the five known BBS loci have been implicated in this mode of oligogenic disease transmission. We present a comprehensive analysis of the spectrum, distribution, and involvement in non-Mendelian trait transmission of mutant alleles in BBS1, the most common BBS locus. Analyses of 259 independent families segregating a BBS phenotype indicate that BBS1 participates in complex inheritance and that, in different families, mutations in BBS1 can interact genetically with mutations at each of the other known BBS genes, as well as at unknown loci, to cause the phenotype. Consistent with this model, we identified homozygous M390R alleles, the most frequent BBS1 mutation, in asymptomatic individuals in two families. Moreover, our statistical analyses indicate that the prevalence of the M390R allele in the general population is consistent with an oligogenic rather than a recessive model of disease transmission. The distribution of BBS oligogenic alleles also indicates that all BBS loci might interact genetically with each other, but some genes, especially BBS2 and BBS6, are more likely to participate in triallelic inheritance, suggesting a variable ability of the BBS proteins to interact genetically with each other.",1

11702204,Extent of linkage disequilibrium between the androgen receptor gene CAG and GGC repeats in human populations: implications for prostate cancer risk,"While studies have implicated alleles at the CAG and GGC trinucleotide repeats of the androgen receptor gene with high-grade, aggressive prostate cancer disease, little is known about the normal range of variation for these two loci, which are separated by about 1.1 kb. More importantly, few data exist on the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the two loci in different human populations. Here we present data on CAG and GGC allelic variation and LD in six diverse populations. Alleles at the CAG and GGC repeat loci of the androgen receptor were typed in over 1000 chromosomes from Africa, Asia, and North America. Levels of linkage disequilibrium between the two loci were compared between populations. Haplotype variation and diversity were estimated for each population. Our results reveal that populations of African descent possess significantly shorter alleles for the two loci than non-African populations (P<0.0001). Allelic diversity for both markers was higher among African Americans than any other population, including indigenous Africans from Sierra Leone and Nigeria. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that approx. 20% of CAG and GGC repeat variance could be attributed to differences between the populations. All non-African populations possessed the same common haplotype while the three populations of African descent possessed three divergent common haplotypes. Significant LD was observed in our sample of healthy African Americans. The LD observed in the African American population may be due to several reasons; recent migration of African Americans from diverse rural communities following urbanization, recurrent gene flow from diverse West African populations, and admixture with European Americans. This study represents the largest genotyping effort to be performed on the two androgen receptor trinucleotide repeat loci in diverse human populations.",1
9585595,Dating the origin of the CCR5-Delta32 AIDS-resistance allele by the coalescence of haplotypes,"The CCR5-Delta32 deletion obliterates the CCR5 chemokine and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 coreceptor on lymphoid cells, leading to strong resistance against HIV-1 infection and AIDS. A genotype survey of 4,166 individuals revealed a cline of CCR5-Delta32 allele frequencies of 0%-14% across Eurasia, whereas the variant is absent among native African, American Indian, and East Asian ethnic groups. Haplotype analysis of 192 Caucasian chromosomes revealed strong linkage disequilibrium between CCR5 and two microsatellite loci. By use of coalescence theory to interpret modern haplotype genealogy, we estimate the origin of the CCR5-Delta32-containing ancestral haplotype to be approximately 700 years ago, with an estimated range of 275-1,875 years. The geographic cline of CCR5-Delta32 frequencies and its recent emergence are consistent with a historic strong selective event (e.g. , an epidemic of a pathogen that, like HIV-1, utilizes CCR5), driving its frequency upward in ancestral Caucasian populations.",1

Using green fluorescent protein-tagged chimeras and three-dimensional video microscopy, we show that CD4 and TCR-associated CD3zeta cluster in the interface coincident with increases in intracellular calcium. Signaling-, costimulation-, and cytoskeleton-dependent processes then stabilize CD3zeta in a single cluster at the center of the interface, while CD4 moves to the periphery. Thus, the CD4 coreceptor may serve primarily to ",1
20206884,The burden of incidental findings in clinical practice in a tertiary care center,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the prevalence and clinical burden of serendipitously discovered abnormalities in hospitalized patients, unrelated to their presenting symptoms and physical signs. METHODS: A total of 478 patients consecutively admitted in the Department of Medicine were enrolled in the study. In the end of first diagnostic work-up, the previously undetected imaging or endoscopic asymptomatic abnormalities termed as incidental findings (IFs) were recorded and some of them were further investigated. RESULTS: One hundred thirty eight (28.8%) patients had IFs. The most common IFs were located in the kidney and genitourinary system followed by liver and gallbladder. The most common method of detection of IFs was ultrasonography (US) of the abdomen. The patients with IFs compared with those without, were older (P=0.007), had no previous hospitalizations (P<0.001) and stayed longer in the hospital (P<0.001). The 25 (18.1%) patients with IFs were not evaluated further. One hundred seventy seven IFs discovered in 113 patients were further evaluated by medical specialists and additional tests were performed if warranted. In the end of the diagnostic work-up, in a total of 113 patients with IFs, 78.7% had insignificant and 21.2% potentially significant IFs. The latter group had higher rate of IFs compared with the former group, usually more than 3 (P=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: IFs were prevalent in a hospital population. Hospitalized patients with IFs were more than 60 years old and had no previous hospitalization. A large number of IFs were potentially significant deserving further clinical management.",0

1352356,Terminal 22q deletion associated with a partial deficiency of arylsulphatase A,"A 7 month old girl with psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, and minor malformations was found to have a terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 22, del(22)(q13.31). The partial deficiency of arylsulphatase A (ARSA) and the normal level of NADH diaphorase 1 (DIA1) suggests that the ARSA locus can be regionally assigned to 22q13.31----qter and the DIA1 locus can be excluded from the same segment. This report is the third published case with a terminal 22q deletion.",1
2445583,Human complement factor H: expression of an additional truncated gene product of 43 kDa in human liver,"The human complement factor H is an important factor in the control of the alternative pathway and also induces the stimulation of B cells and macrophages in vitro. Using a human factor H cDNA clone as probe, two factor H-specific transcripts of 4.4 and 1.8 kb were detected in four human livers. Both mRNAs were found independently of the expression of an acute phase marker SAA, in these livers, indicating that their presence is not linked to an acute phase state. The shorter transcript was cloned in two cDNA plasmids H-19 and H-20, lacking only seven amino acids of the N-terminus of the mature factor H protein. The deduced protein sequence showed that this protein is identical to the N-terminal portion of the large classical factor H of 150 kDa mol. mass. Parallel to the finding that the N-terminal sequence of factor H is expressed by two distinct mRNA species, evidence is presented that the C-terminal sequence is also contained on two different transcripts, the common 4.4-kb mRNA and an additional 1.0-kb mRNA. A novel, short form of human complement factor H of 43 kDa was detected in human sera which represents the translation product of the 1.8-kb factor H-specific mRNA detected in human liver. Five distinct epitopes detected with 6 monoclonal antibodies are present on both the 150-kDa factor H protein and the truncated 43-kDa molecule. We conclude that additional H-specific mRNAs are found in human liver and that at least one of them is translated yielding a truncated form of factor H.",1

8807330,Mutations and polymorphisms in the familial early-onset breast cancer (BRCA1) gene. Breast Cancer Information Core,"Mutations in the familial early-onset breast cancer gene (BRCA1) account for approximately 2-5% of all breast cancer cases (Easton et al., 1993). Since the isolation of the BRCA1 gene in 1994, many mutations have been identified. We report here a total of 254 BRCA1 mutations, 132 (52%) of which are unique. These represent mutations entered into a database established by the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), which have appeared in the literature or have been submitted by BIC members and other contributors prior to publication. A total of 221 (87%) of all mutations or 107 (81%) of the unique mutations are small deletions, insertions, nonsense point mutations, splice variants, and regulatory mutations that result in truncation or absence of the BRCA1 protein. A total of 11 disease-associated missense mutations (5 unique), and 21 variants (19 unique) as yet unclassified as either missense mutations or polymorphisms have been detected. Thirty-five independent benign polymorphisms are also described. The most common mutations are 185delAG and 5382insC, which account for 30 (11.7%) and 26 (10.1%), respectively, of all mutations shown. The biological and clinical relevance of these BRCA1 mutations is discussed.",1

28184327,The Effects of Monosodium Glutamate and Tannic Acid on Adult Rats,"BACKGROUND: Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a widely-used flavor enhancer and stabilizer in ready-made or packaged foods. The excessive use of MSG has been shown to increase oxidative stress in different organ systems and causes glucose metabolism disorders, obesity, and coronary diseases. OBJECTIVES: In this study, the antioxidant activity of tannic acid was investigated experimentally with respect to its protective effects against overdosed MSG-induced oxidative stress in rats. The study took place in Turkey in August 2013. METHODS: Four groups (n = 7) of three- to four-month-old Sprague-Dawley female rats were used in this study. The first group was the control, who were administered saline. The second group received tannic acid (50 mg/kg, 3 days) intraperitoneally (i.p.). The third group received MSG (2 g/kg, 7 days) i.p., and the fourth group received both tannic acid (50 mg/kg, 3 days, pretreatment) and MSG (2 g/kg, 7 days) i.p. The animals were euthanized ten days later. Blood was collected for determining the hematological values and blood glucose levels. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined in the brain, liver, and kidney homogenates, and in the erythrocyte hemolysate. Histopathological examination of the brain, liver, and kidneys was conducted through hematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS: The data showed that the tannic acid treatment statistically decreased the MDA levels in the brain tissues of the group administered MSG and tannic acid (P < 0.001) when compared to the corresponding values of the control group. The SOD activities in the blood hemolysates of the MSG and tannic acid group increased when compared to the corresponding values for the MSG group (P < 0.01). Additionally, we found that pretreatment with tannic acid reduced blood glucose levels in comparison to the levels of the MSG group (P = 0.029). The results of our study show that tannic acid pretreatment in adult rats decreased blood glucose levels and oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: In the literature, it was observed that short-term MSG exposure does not cause significant histological changes in the kidneys, liver, or brain cortex. These findings should be re-evaluated in additional long-term studies.",0
12818779,Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in the child. A case report with associated atrial fibrillation,"UNLABELLED: In children, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is often revealed by reentrant tachycardia episodes. Rarely, this syndrome can be the cause of syncope or of sudden death, resulting from rapid conduction of atrial fibrillation to the ventricles through the accessory pathway. CASE REPORT: The authors report the case of a child, who had a WPW syndrome diagnosed after birth because of a supraventricular tachycardia and who was later asymptomatic. At ten years of age, he was admitted because of palpitations due to atrial fibrillation and rapid conduction through the accessory pathway. CONCLUSION: In a child with WPW syndrome, tachycardia with wide and irregular QRS complexes should evoke the involvement of atrial fibrillation, with rapid conduction to the ventricle. Drugs blocking conduction through the atrio-ventricular node are contra-indicated and the condition is an indication for radiofrequency ablation.",0
19748617,Evaluating the effect of the new incentive system for high-risk pressure ulcer patients on wound healing and cost-effectiveness: a cohort study,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of new incentive system for pressure ulcer management, which focused on skilled nurse staffing in terms of rate of healing and medical costs. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study included two types of groups: 39 institutions, which introduced the new incentive system, and 20 non-introduced groups (control). Sixty-seven patients suffering from severe pressure ulcers in the introduced group and 38 patients in the non-introduced group were included. Wound healing and medical costs were monitored weekly for three weeks by their skilled nurses in charge. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Healing status and related medical costs. RESULTS: The introduced group showed significantly higher rate of healing compared with the control group at each weekly assessment. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the introduction of the new incentive system was independently associated with the faster healing rate (beta=3.44, P<.001). The budget impact analysis demonstrated that introducing this system could reduce cost of treating severe pressure ulcers by 1.776 billion yen per year. CONCLUSIONS: The new incentive system for the management of pressure ulcers, which focused on staffing with skilled nurses can improve healing rate with reduced medical cost.",0
15815585,Endothelin-1 overexpression leads to further water accumulation and brain edema after middle cerebral artery occlusion via aquaporin 4 expression in astrocytic end-feet,"Stroke patients have increased levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a strong vasoconstrictor, in their plasma or cerebrospinal fluid. Previously, we showed high level of ET-1 mRNA expression in astrocytes after hypoxia/ischemia. It is unclear whether the contribution of ET-1 induction in astrocytes is protective or destructive in cerebral ischemia. Here, we generated a transgenic mouse model that overexpress ET-1 in astrocytes (GET-1) using the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter to examine the role of astrocytic ET-1 in ischemic stroke by challenging these mice with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Under normal condition, GET-1 mice showed no abnormality in brain morphology, cerebrovasculature, absolute cerebral blood flow, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and mean arterial blood pressure. Yet, GET-1 mice subjected to transient MCAO showed more severe neurologic deficits and increased infarct, which were partially normalized by administration of ABT-627 (ET(A) antagonist) 5 mins after MCAO. In addition, GET-1 brains exhibited more Evans blue extravasation and showed decreased endothelial occludin expression after MCAO, correlating with higher brain water content and increased cerebral edema. Aquaporin 4 expression was also more pronounced in astrocytic end-feet on blood vessels in GET-1 ipsilateral brains. Our current data suggest that astrocytic ET-1 has deleterious effects on water homeostasis, cerebral edema and BBB integrity, which contribute to more severe ischemic brain injury.",0

9662443,"Chromosomal localization, genomic organization, and developmental expression of the murine caveolin gene family (Cav-1, -2, and -3). Cav-1 and Cav-2 genes map to a known tumor suppressor locus (6-A2/7q31)","Caveolins (Cav-1, -2, and -3) are a gene family of cytoplasmic membrane-anchored scaffolding proteins that: (i) help to sculpt caveolae membranes from the plasma membrane proper; and (ii) participate in the sequestration of inactive signaling molecules. In the adult, caveolin-1 and -2 are co-expressed and are most abundant in type I pneumocytes, endothelia, fibroblastic cells and adipocytes, while the expression of caveolin-3 is restricted to striated muscle cells. However, little is known regarding the genomic organization and developmental expression of the caveolin gene family. Here, using the mouse as a model system, we examine the chromosomal localization, the detailed intron-exon organization, and developmental expression pattern of the caveolin gene family. cDNAs encoding caveolin-1, -2, and -3 were used as probes to isolate murine genomic clones containing these genes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using these genomic clones as probes reveals that all three caveolin genes are localized to murine chromosome 6. Specifically, caveolin-1 and -2 co-localize to chromosomal region 6-A2, while caveolin-3 is located within the chromosomal region 6-E1. Searches of the NCBI Human/Mouse Homology map indicate that murine region 6-A2 corresponds to human chromosome 7q31. As this region (6-A2/7q31) is the site of an as yet unidentified tumor suppressor gene(s), our mapping studies clearly define caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 as candidate genes that may be deleted at these loci. All three caveolin genes show similar intron-exon organization, with the last exon of each gene encoding the bulk of the known caveolin functional domains. The boundary position of the last exon is essentially identical in all three caveolin genes, suggesting that they may have arisen through gene duplication events. Developmentally, all three caveolins were expressed late during mouse embryogenesis as assessed by Northern and Western blot analysis. We examined the localization of the caveolin proteins in sections of day 16 mouse embryos using a well-characterized panel of antibody probes. Caveolin-1 and -2 were most abundantly expressed in the developing lung parenchyma, while caveolin-3 was most abundantly expressed in developing tissues that consist primarily of skeletal muscle cells. As the expression of all three caveolins in the adult is highest in terminally differentiated cell types, this is consistent with the idea that caveolins may be viewed as late markers of differentiation during embryogenesis.",1
27482384,Diabetes mellitus: an important risk factor for reactivation of tuberculosis,"UNLABELLED: Diabetes mellitus was identified as a risk factor for developing tuberculosis (TB) infection, and relapse after therapy. The risk of acquiring TB is described as comparable to that of HIV population. The fact that diabetics are 3x times more prone to develop pulmonary TB than nondiabetics cannot be overlooked. With DM recognized as global epidemic, and TB affecting one-third of the world population, physicians must remain vigilant. We present a 45-year-old woman born in Dominican Republic (DR), with 10-year history of T2DM treated with metformin, arrived to our Urgency Room complaining of dry cough for the past 3months. Interview unveiled unintentional 15lbs weight loss, night sweats, occasional unquantified fever, and general malaise but denied bloody sputum. She traveled to DR 2years before, with no known ill exposure. Physical examination showed a thin body habitus, otherwise well appearing woman with stable vital signs, presenting solely right middle lung field ronchi. LDH, ESR, hsCRP and Hg A1C were elevated. Imaging revealed a right middle lobe cavitation. Sputum for AFB disclosed active pulmonary TB. Our case portrays that the consideration of TB as differential diagnosis in diabetics should be exercised with the same strength, as it is undertaken during the evaluation of HIV patients with lung cavitation. Inability to recognize TB will endanger the patient, hospital dwellers and staff, and perpetuate this global public health menace. LEARNING POINTS: Diabetes mellitus should be considered an important risk factor for the reactivation of pulmonary tuberculosis.High clinical suspicious should be taken into consideration as radiological findings for pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with diabetes mellitus may be atypical, involving middle and lower lobes.Inability to recognize pulmonary tuberculosis will endanger the patient, hospital dwellers and staff, and perpetuate this global public health menace.",0
7951316,A physical map and candidate genes in the BRCA1 region on chromosome 17q12-21,"We have constructed a physical map of a 4 cM region on chromosome 17q12-21 that contains the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene BRCA1. The map comprises a contig of 137 overlapping yeast artificial chromosomes and P1 clones, onto which we have placed 112 PCR markers. We have localized more than 20 genes on this map, ten of which had not been mapped to the region previously, and have isolated 30 cDNA clones representing partial sequences of as yet unidentified genes. Two genes that lie within a narrow region defined by meiotic breakpoints in BRCA1 patients have been sequenced in breast cancer patients without revealing any deleterious mutations. These new reagents should facilitate the identification of BRCA1.",1
9394718,"Human studies on the effects of fatty acids on cancer: summary, gaps, and future research","Both the goal of understanding the basic biology of cancer development as well as the practical considerations involving public health, marketing, and nutrition education have stimulated interest on the effects of individual fatty acids on cancer. Data on diet-disease relations must meet the standard of significant scientific agreement based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence. The process of arriving at significant scientific agreement begins by collecting data accumulated from epidemiologic associations, animal studies, and clinical trials. This supplement represents one useful effort toward that end. Questions raised include: 1) What stage of the disease is being studied, what are the relevant characteristics of the study participants, how well characterized was the diet, and were appropriate experimental designs used; 2) Is there is a significant role for markers of disease and, if so, are the markers available; 3) Is there consistency, strength, and quality of evidence for establishing basic scientific relations; 4) Do dose-response relations, biological plausibility, and temporal relations (with special attention to clinical trials) exist; 5) What is the level of specificity of the data for the health claim or posited relation; and 6) What are the effective amounts of fatty acids in foods and diet? More complete food-composition data with respect to fatty acids and more comprehensive food tables are needed, as are better methods for measuring fat intakes, better markers of progression, and more definitive epidemiologic and clinical studies. At present there is insufficient evidence to conclude that specific fatty acids are associated with cancer development in humans.",0
30881011,Caveolin-1: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progression and its application in clinical treatment,"Human breast cancer is one of the most frequent cancer diseases and causes of death among female population worldwide. It appears at a high incidence and has a high malignancy, mortality, recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is the main component of caveolae and participates in various biological events. More and more experimental studies have shown that Cav1 plays a critical role in the progression of breast cancer including cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, invasion, migration and breast cancer metastasis. Besides, Cav1 has been found to be involved in chemotherapeutics and radiotherapy resistance, which are still the principal problems encountered in clinical breast cancer treatment. In addition, stromal Cav1 may be a potential indicator for breast cancer patients' prognosis. In the current review, we cover the state-of-the-art study, development and progress on Cav1 and breast cancer, altogether describing the role of Cav1 in breast cancer progression and application in clinical treatment, in the hope of providing a basis for further research and promoting CAV1 gene as a potential target to diagnose and treat aggressive breast cancers.",0
15665079,Inositol pyrophosphates regulate cell death and telomere length through phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinases,"Inositol pyrophosphates physiologically regulate vesicular endocytosis, ribosomal disposition, and directly phosphorylate proteins. Here we demonstrate roles in cell death and regulation of telomere length. Lethal actions of wortmannin and caffeine are selectively abolished in yeast mutants that cannot synthesize inositol pyrophosphates. Wortmannin and caffeine appear to act through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinases Tel1 and Mec1, known regulators of telomere length. Inositol pyrophosphates physiologically antagonize the actions of these kinases, which is demonstrated by the fact that yeast mutants with reduced or elevated levels of inositol pyrophosphates, respectively, display longer and shorter telomeres.",1
7989579,Production and characterization of transformed B-lymphocytes expressing the membrane defect of Scott syndrome,"Scott syndrome is a bleeding disorder associated with an isolated defect in expression of membrane coagulant activity by stimulated platelets. This defect represents a decrease in platelet membrane binding sites for coagulation factors Va and VIIIa, reflecting diminished surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS). To gain insight into the cellular and genetic basis for this disorder, B-lymphocytes from a patient with Scott syndrome and from normal donors were immortalized by EBV-transformation, and tested for their capacity to expose plasma membrane PS in response to the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187. Upon incubation with A23187, EBV-lymphoblasts derived from normal donors consistently induced surface expression of PS in > 70% of all cells, as detected by membrane association of the PS-binding proteins, factor Va or annexin V. PS exposure in these cells was maximal after 5 min, and saturated at < 100 microM external free [Ca2+]. By contrast, < 30% of Scott syndrome lymphoblasts exposed PS, and saturation was not observed at > 1 mM external free [Ca2+]. Single-cell clones derived from the Scott lymphoblasts all exhibited a diminished response to A23187 comparable with that of the parental cells, suggesting that all lymphocytes from this patient share this membrane abnormality. Hybridomas prepared by fusion of Scott lymphoblasts with the myeloma cell line UC-LUC showed responses to Ca2+ ionophore comparable to those observed for normal lymphoblasts and for hybridomas prepared by fusion of normal lymphoblasts with UC-LUC. This correction of the Scott abnormality suggests possible complementation of an aberrant gene(s) responsible for this disorder.",1
9804553,Transformation of tooth type induced by inhibition of BMP signaling,"Mammalian dentitions are highly patterned, with different types of teeth positioned in different regions of the jaws. BMP4 is an early oral epithelial protein signal that directs odontogenic gene expression in mesenchyme cells of the developing mandibular arch. BMP4 was shown to inhibit expression of the homeobox gene Barx-1 and to restrict expression to the proximal, presumptive molar mesenchyme of mouse embryos at embryonic day 10. The inhibition of BMP signaling early in mandible development by the action of exogenous Noggin protein resulted in ectopic Barx-1 expression in the distal, presumptive incisor mesenchyme and a transformation of tooth identity from incisor to molar.",1
29388167,Surface Induced Dissociation Coupled with High Resolution Mass Spectrometry Unveils Heterogeneity of a 211 kDa Multicopper Oxidase Protein Complex,"Manganese oxidation is an important biogeochemical process that is largely regulated by bacteria through enzymatic reactions. However, the detailed mechanism is poorly understood due to challenges in isolating and characterizing these unknown enzymes. A manganese oxidase, Mnx, from Bacillus sp. PL-12 has been successfully overexpressed in active form as a protein complex with a molecular mass of 211 kDa. We have recently used surface induced dissociation (SID) and ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) to release and detect folded subcomplexes for determining subunit connectivity and quaternary structure. The data from the native mass spectrometry experiments led to a plausible structural model of this multicopper oxidase, which has been difficult to study by conventional structural biology methods. It was also revealed that each Mnx subunit binds a variable number of copper ions. Becasue of the heterogeneity of the protein and limited mass resolution, ambiguities in assigning some of the observed peaks remained as a barrier to fully understanding the role of metals and potential unknown ligands in Mnx. In this study, we performed SID in a modified Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer. The high mass accuracy and resolution offered by FTICR unveiled unexpected artificial modifications on the protein that had been previously thought to be iron bound species based on lower resolution spectra. Additionally, isotopically resolved spectra of the released subcomplexes revealed the metal binding stoichiometry at different structural levels. This method holds great potential for in-depth characterization of metalloproteins and protein-ligand complexes. Graphical Abstract .",0
25763265,Spatial modeling of colonic lesions with geographic information systems,"BACKGROUND: Geographic information system (GIS) software has been used in health care systems to display and analyze spatial pattern of diseases and health services. OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to assess spatial patterns of colon's pathologic lesions based on the pathologic reports and assess whether it is possible to use GIS software in health services. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Archives of pathology of Namazi and Faghihi hospitals, two main referral centers of south-west of Iran, were obtained and reviewed between January 2009 and September 2011 for biopsy reports of patients who underwent colonoscopy. Abnormal biopsies were categorized into five different subgroups according to the type of pathologic specimens. By GIS, spatial patterns of colon biopsies were plotted in different maps and spatial auto-correlation of colon biopsies was calculated using the Moran's Index. RESULTS: A total of 4815 biopsies from 2663 different patients were reviewed, 53.8% of which were men. Abnormal biopsies were 2781 of all specimens (57.8%). Neoplastic lesions, inflammatory bowel diseases and polyps were 9.3%, 19.3% and 29.2% of total biopsies, respectively. Pathologic biopsies were more common in the distal colon. Maps of all biopsies and maps of specific pathologies were manifested in GIS. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that left-sided lesions are still more common in the Iranian population. On the other hand, surveying the right side of colon is as important as the distal part, which necessitates total colonoscopy.",0

26486340,Co-administration of Microbubbles and Drugs in Ultrasound-Assisted Drug Delivery: Comparison with Drug-Carrying Particles,"There are two alternative approaches to ultrasound-assisted drug delivery. First, the drug can be entrapped into or attached onto the ultrasound-responsive particles and administered in the vasculature, to achieve ultrasound-triggered drug release from the particles and localized tissue deposition in response to ultrasound treatment of the target zone. Second, the drug can be co-administered with the microbubbles or other sonosensitive particles. In this case, the action of ultrasound on the particles (which act as cavitation nuclei) results in the transient improvement of permeability of the physiological barriers, so that the circulating drug can exit the bloodstream and get into the target tissues and cells. We discuss and compare both of these approaches, their characteristic advantages and disadvantages for the specific drug delivery scenarios. Clearly, the system based on the off-label use of the existing approved microbubbles and drugs (or drug carriers) will have a chance of getting to clinical trials faster and with lesser resources spent. However, if a superior curative potential of a sonosensitive drug carrier is proven, and formulation stability problems are addressed properly, this approach may find its way to practical use, especially for nucleic acid delivery scenarios.

23421839,Maternal and paternal perceptions of coparenting as a link between marital quality and the parent-toddler relationship,"The aim of this study was to examine coparenting perceptions of support and trust as a link between marital quality and parent-child relationship quality. Mothers and fathers with 33-month-old children (n = 122, 61 girls) independently reported on coparenting support and trust, marital quality, and attachment-relevant aspects of the parent-child relationship. Additionally, child-mother attachment security was assessed observationally. Marital quality was related to higher quality mother-son relationships (self-reported and observed) via more positive maternal coparenting perceptions, and marital quality was related to greater father-son and father-daughter relationship quality via more positive paternal coparenting perceptions. For partner effects, marital quality was related to higher mother-son relationship quality via fathers' perceptions of coparenting. Results highlight perceptions of coparenting of both mothers and fathers as a link between marital quality and mother-child relationship quality for families with toddler-aged boys. Further, findings suggest that marital quality fosters more positive paternal coparenting trust and support, which in turn has positive implications for father-son and father-daughter relationships during toddlerhood.",0

16205833,Identification and functional analysis of cystathionine beta-synthase gene mutations in patients with homocystinuria,"Homocystinuria is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism that is most often caused by mutation in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene. Patients may develop serious clinical manifestations such as lens dislocation, mental retardation, osteoporosis, and atherothrombotic vascular disease. Over 100 mutations have been reported, but so far, none have been reported in Korea. Mutation analysis of the CBS gene in six Korean patients with homocystinuria was performed by direct sequencing. Eight mutations were identified, including four known mutations (T257M, R336C, T353M, and G347S) and four novel mutations (L154Q, A155V, del234D, and A288T). All patients were compound heterozygotes. To characterize these mutations, normal or mutated forms of CBS were cloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector followed by transfection into mammalian cells for transient expression. Whereas the expression levels of mutant proteins were comparable to that of normal control, enzyme activities of all the mutant forms were significantly decreased. In addition, a novel single nucleotide polymorphism, R18C, was identified, which showed one-third to two-thirds the enzyme activity of wild type and 1% of the allele frequency in normal control. The spectrum of mutations observed in Korean patients bears less resemblance to those observed in Western countries.",1
3524268,Prostaglandins stimulate calcium-linked changes in heart mitochondrial respiration,"This study was done to determine the influence of prostaglandins (PGs) on oxidative phosphorylation and Ca-related changes in cardiac mitochondria. For most of the experiments mitochondria were isolated by using a nagarse-homogenization combination method that yields both subsarcolemmal and interfibrillar populations. When Ca (30-420 microM) was added a progressive stimulation in resting respiration was observed. Similarly, preaddition of Ca inhibited subsequent oxidative phosphorylation when ADP was added to the same preparation. The effect of calcium was enhanced by pretreating mitochondria with PGs E2, F2 alpha, and I2 (prostacyclin). Three PG concentrations, 100 pg/ml, 1 ng/ml, and 10 ng/ml were evaluated. For the most part the effect of PGs was concentration dependent with the exception of PGE2, which showed no effect at the highest concentration. The effects of PGs were observed when both NADH (pyruvate-malate) and succinate-linked respiratory substrates were used. Similar effects were evident when mitochondria were harvested using a non-nagarse homogenization method that yields a primarily subsarcolemmal population, although this preparation exhibited substantially higher sensitivity to Ca. None of the PGs had any direct effect on either resting respiration rate or oxidative phosphorylation in the absence of Ca, irrespective of isolation procedure or choice of substrate. The study demonstrates that PGs can augment Ca-related changes in cardiac mitochondrial respiration through an as yet unknown mechanism. The results may be important in understanding the role of endogenously synthesized PGs in cardiac pathology associated with defective intracellular Ca homeostasis.",0
21814426,Development and validation of stability indicating method for the quantitative determination of venlafaxine hydrochloride in extended release formulation using high performance liquid chromatography,"OBJECTIVE: Venlafaxine,hydrochloride is a structurally novel phenethyl bicyclic antidepressant, and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It inhibits the reuptake of dopamine. Venlafaxine HCL is widely prescribed in the form of sustained release formulations. In the current article we are reporting the development and validation of a fast and simple stability indicating, isocratic high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of venlafaxine hydrochloride in sustained release formulations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The quantitative determination of venlafaxine hydrochloride was performed on a Kromasil C18 analytical column (250 x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 mum particle size) with 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 4.5): methanol (40: 60) as a mobile phase, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. For HPLC methods, UV detection was made at 225 nm. RESULTS: During method validation, parameters such as precision, linearity, accuracy, stability, limit of quantification and detection and specificity were evaluated, which remained within acceptable limits. CONCLUSIONS: The method has been successfully applied for the quantification and dissolution profiling of Venlafaxine HCL in sustained release formulation. The method presents a simple and reliable solution for the routine quantitative analysis of Venlafaxine HCL.",0
24400106,Intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts support the growth of intestinal epithelial stem cells,"Intestinal epithelial stem cells (ISCs) are the focus of recent intense study. Current in vitro models rely on supplementation with the Wnt agonist R-spondin1 to support robust growth, ISC self-renewal, and differentiation. Intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) are important supportive cells within the ISC niche. We hypothesized that co-culture with ISEMF enhances the growth of ISCs in vitro and allows for their successful in vivo implantation and engraftment. ISC-containing small intestinal crypts, FACS-sorted single ISCs, and ISEMFs were procured from C57BL/6 mice. Crypts and single ISCs were grown in vitro into enteroids, in the presence or absence of ISEMFs. ISEMFs enhanced the growth of intestinal epithelium in vitro in a proximity-dependent fashion, with co-cultures giving rise to larger enteroids than monocultures. Co-culture of ISCs with supportive ISEMFs relinquished the requirement of exogenous R-spondin1 to sustain long-term growth and differentiation of ISCs. Mono- and co-cultures were implanted subcutaneously in syngeneic mice. Co-culture with ISEMFs proved necessary for successful in vivo engraftment and proliferation of enteroids; implants without ISEMFs did not survive. ISEMF whole transcriptome sequencing and qPCR demonstrated high expression of specific R-spondins, well-described Wnt agonists that supports ISC growth. Specific non-supportive ISEMF populations had reduced expression of R-spondins. The addition of ISEMFs in intestinal epithelial culture therefore recapitulates a critical element of the intestinal stem cell niche and allows for its experimental interrogation and biodesign-driven manipulation.

17370235,Applying the health belief model to analyze intention to participate in preventive pulmonary tuberculosis chest X-ray examinations among indigenous nursing students,"The purpose of this study was to investigate knowledge, perceptions of tuberculosis (TB) and intent to receive chest X-ray screening among indigenous (Taiwanese of ethnic Malayo-Polynesian descent) nursing students in Taiwan. A convenience sample was chosen from an technical institute in northern Taiwan that maintained admission quotas and provided scholarships for indigenous students. This school had over 150 classes and around 7,000 students, about 20% -25% of whom were ethnically indigenous. A power analysis based on a pilot study showed that a large effect size required a minimum sample of 485. To attain this number, 50 classes from years one through five were randomly selected based on an expected sampling of 20 students per classroom. In all, 1,000 questionnaires were distributed and 865 returned, for a response rate of 86.5%. A cross-sectional study design was used, and this study was run between the months of February and June 2003. Survey responses were self-reported in two questionnaires that gathered information on respondent knowledge and perceptions regarding TB and intent to take chest X-ray tests. Study results showed a moderate level of general knowledge about TB, misunderstandings regarding transmission vectors, and low perceptions regarding susceptibility. The knowledge score was associated with perceived benefits and barriers to preventing TB. Different places of residence influenced perceived barriers to preventing and treating TB. Age was negatively associated with the perceived benefits of receiving a chest X-ray exam for TB. Indigenous nursing students with higher perceptions of susceptibility and severity and lower perception of barriers on preventing TB had a higher level of intent to take the X-ray exam. Nursing schools must address the subject of TB in-depth and design age-specific curricula that incorporate multifaceted strategies for different students. Additionally, health educators should design health education programs targeted to dispel misconceptions and improve both knowledge and levels of awareness of tuberculosis among the indigenous population in order to enhance their willingness and ability to detect TB.",0
25731903,Cortical regions involved in semantic processing investigated by repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and object naming,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the cortical representation of semantic processing is mainly derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or direct cortical stimulation (DCS) studies. Because DCS is regarded as the gold standard in terms of language mapping but can only be used during awake surgery due to its invasive character, repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)-a non-invasive modality that uses a similar technique as DCS-seems highly feasible for use in the investigation of semantic processing in the healthy human brain. METHODS: A total number of 100 (50 left-hemispheric and 50 right-hemispheric) rTMS-based language mappings were performed in 50 purely right-handed, healthy volunteers during an object-naming task. All rTMS-induced semantic naming errors were then counted and evaluated systematically. Furthermore, since the distribution of stimulations within both hemispheres varied between individuals and cortical regions stimulated, all elicited errors were standardized and subsequently related to their cortical sites by projecting the mapping results into the cortical parcellation system (CPS). RESULTS: Overall, the most left-hemispheric semantic errors were observed after targeting the rTMS to the posterior middle frontal gyrus (pMFG; standardized error rate: 7.3 per thousand), anterior supramarginal gyrus (aSMG; 5.6 per thousand), and ventral postcentral gyrus (vPoG; 5.0 per thousand). In contrast to that, the highest right-hemispheric error rates occurred after stimulation of the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG; 12.4 per thousand), middle superior temporal gyrus (mSTG; 6.2 per thousand), and anterior supramarginal gyrus (aSMG; 6.2 per thousand). CONCLUSIONS: Although error rates were low, the rTMS-based approach of investigating semantic processing during object naming shows convincing results compared to the current literature. Therefore, rTMS seems a valuable, safe, and reliable tool for the investigation of semantic processing within the healthy human brain.",0
27314994,Colistin in the post-antibiotic era,"One of the most important features of the post-antibiotic era in the late 20th century is the resurgence of colistin for the treatment of extensively drug resistant gram-negative bacteria (XDR). Colistin is a narrow spectrum anti-biotic, active against microorganisms with clinical significance such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Nowadays its toxicity is lower, partly explained by better pharmaceuticals and management of the critically ill patients. However, there has been much confusion regarding the dosage of the drug, its name and labeling, therefore, experts have recommended using a common language about this polymyxin. The lack of PK/PD studies for colistin is perhaps the main weakness of this area of knowledge, even though the before mentioned approach has contributed with new ways to manage and calculate the dose of this antimicrobial. Indeed, the efficiency of colistin in association with a second agent in reducing mortality has not been demonstrated. ",0
19263244,P2X(7): a growth-promoting receptor-implications for cancer,"The P2X(7) receptor is widely referred to as the paradigmatic cytotoxic nucleotide receptor, and is often taken as an epitome of cytotoxic receptors as a whole. However, cytotoxicity is the result of sustained pharmacological stimulation, which is likely to occur in vivo only under severe pathological conditions. Over the years, we have gathered robust experimental proof that led us to adopt an entirely different view, pointing to P2X(7) as a survival/growth-promoting rather than death-inducing receptor. Evidence in favour of this role is manifold: (1) extracellular ATP and benzoyl ATP support cell proliferation in peripheral T lymphocytes via a P2X(7)-like receptor; (2) P2X(7) transfection into several cell lines confers growth advantage; (3) HEK293 cells transfected with P2X(7) show enhanced mitochondrial metabolic activity and growth; (4) lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent growth arrest of microglia is mediated via P2X(7) down-modulation; (5) several malignant tumours express high P2X(7) levels and (6) the ATP concentration in tumour interstitium is several-fold higher than in healthy tissues, to a level in principle sufficient to activate the P2X(7) receptor. The molecular basis of P2X(7)-mediated growth-promoting activity is poorly known, but mitochondria appear to play a central role. A deeper understanding of the role played by P2X(7) in cell proliferation might provide an insight into the mechanism of normal and malignant cell growth and suggest novel anti-tumour therapies.",0
8177268,Linkage of the angiotensinogen gene to essential hypertension,"BACKGROUND: The renin-angiotensin system is a powerful pressor system with a major influence on salt and water homeostasis. Angiotensinogen (also called renin substrate) is a key component of this system; it is cleaved by renin to yield angiotensin I, which is then cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme to yield angiotensin II. The observation that plasma angiotensinogen levels correlate with blood pressure and track through families suggests that angiotensinogen may have a role in essential hypertension. We therefore investigated whether there is linkage between the angiotensinogen gene on chromosome 1q42-43 and essential hypertension. METHODS: Samples of DNA from 63 white European families in which two or more members had essential hypertension were tested for linkage of the angiotensinogen gene to this disorder. Affected cousins, nephews, nieces, and half-siblings were included when possible. To test for linkage, we used as a marker a dinucleotide-repeat sequence flanking this gene, and we employed the affected-pedigree-member method of linkage analysis. Two molecular variants of the angiotensinogen gene, one encoding threonine instead of methionine at position 235 (M235T) and the other encoding methionine rather than threonine at position 174 (T174M), were also tested for possible association with essential hypertension. RESULTS: We found significant linkage (t = 5.00, P < 0.001) and association (chi-square = 53.3, P < 0.001) of the angiotensinogen-gene locus to essential hypertension in the 63 multiplex families. This linkage was consistently maintained in the subgroup of subjects with diastolic pressure above 100 mm Hg and in the subgroups classified according to sex. It has been proposed previously that T174M and M235T are associated with essential hypertension. However, we found no association in our population between either polymorphism and this disorder. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides strong and consistent support for the linkage to essential hypertension of regions within or close to the angiotensinogen gene. Precisely how mutations in this region may result in hypertension remains to be determined.",1
12522556,Mutations in the calcium-binding motifs of CDH23 and the 35delG mutation in GJB2 cause hearing loss in one family,"We have ascertained a multi-generation family with apparent autosomal recessive non-syndromic childhood hearing loss (DFNB). Failure to demonstrate linkage in a genome-wide scan with 300 polymorphic markers has suggested genetic heterogeneity for the hearing loss in this family. This heterogeneity could be demonstrated by analysis of candidate loci and genes for DFNB. Patients in one branch of the family (branch C) are homozygous for the 35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene (DFNB1). Patients in two other branches (A and B) carry two new mutations in the cadherin 23 ( CDH23) gene (DFNB12). A homozygous CDH23 c.6442G-->A (D2148N) mutation is present in branch A. Patients in branch B are compound heterozygous for this mutation and the c.4021G-->A (D1341N) mutation. The substituted aspartic acid residues are highly conserved and are part of the calcium-binding sites of the extracellular cadherin (EC) domains. Molecular modeling of the mutated EC domains of CDH23 based on the structure of E-cadherin indicates that calcium-binding is impaired. In addition, other aspartic and glutamic acid residue substitutions in the highly conserved calcium-binding sites reported to cause DFNB12 are also likely to result in a decreased affinity for calcium. Since calcium provides rigidity to the elongated structure of cadherin molecules enabling homophilic lateral interaction, these mutations are likely to impair interactions of CDH23 molecules either with CDH23 or with other proteins. DFNB12 is the first human disorder that can be attributed to inherited missense mutations in the highly conserved residues of the extracellular calcium-binding domain of a cadherin.",1

3037531,Molecular cloning of the akt oncogene and its human homologues AKT1 and AKT2: amplification of AKT1 in a primary human gastric adenocarcinoma,"A previous report described the isolation of a directly transforming retrovirus, AKT8, from a spontaneous thymoma of an AKR mouse. The AKT8 provirus has now been molecularly cloned from a transformed, nonproducer cell line. The virus genome contains both viral and nonviral, cell-related sequences; the nonviral sequence has been designated v-akt, the presumed viral oncogene of the AKT8 virus. This gene lacks homology to the 16 other oncogenes tested. The cloned provirus has undergone a partial deletion, during cell passage in vitro, that prevents direct demonstration of the transforming ability of this molecular clone. Two human homologues of the v-akt oncogene, AKT1 and AKT2, were cloned. A survey of 225 human tumors for changes involving AKT1 led to the discovery of a 20-fold amplification of this gene in one of the five gastric adenocarcinomas tested. The results demonstrate that AKT8 has the characteristic structure of a directly transforming retrovirus and that it contains a gene derived from highly conserved cellular sequences that may be involved in the pathogenesis of some human malignancies.",1
1876544,"Genotype, feeding regimen, and diet interactions in meat chickens. 2. Feeding behavior","Feeding behaviors were compared for males from two lines of meat chickens differing in growth potential fed lower and higher density diets ad libitum either daily or on alternate days. Males from the faster growing line ate and drank more often but stood and rested less often than those from the slower growing line. Rate of feed intake per unit BW was, however, similar for both lines. Greater crop and lower intestinal contents of the faster growing line suggested a higher feed intake and storage ability. Even though males fed the lower energy diet initially consumed similar amounts of ME on days of food restoration, by 24 h they lagged behind those fed the higher energy diet, suggesting capacity of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) to be a limiting factor in energy consumption. At older ages, chicks fed the different diets had similar GIT contents, suggesting that excessive eating and less resting observed for males fed the lower density diet contributed to their poorer energy utilization. On the day of feed restoration, males fed on alternate days ate and stood more often and had poorer GIT clearance than those with feed continuously made accessible to them.",0
25659179,"Spine Trabecular Bone Score Precision, a Comparison Between GE Lunar Standard and High-Resolution Densitometers","Trabecular bone score (TBS) is related to microarchitecture and fracture risk independently of bone mineral density (BMD) and clinical risk factors. Widespread clinical TBS use requires documentation of reproducibility and ideally comparability across scanners. This study evaluated TBS reproducibility and explored differences between Lunar Prodigy and iDXA densitometers. Reproducibility was assessed from replicate scans in 210 men and women participating in various dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) precision assessments. iDXA-to-Prodigy comparability was evaluated using 155 participants from 3 study groups. L1-L4 BMD and TBS precision was similar on iDXA and Prodigy (BMD coefficient of variation = 1.9% and 1.5% and TBS coefficient of variation = 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively). Precision did not differ between men and women; however, between-technologist differences (p < 0.05) of similar magnitude were observed for both BMD and TBS. Prodigy-to-Prodigy TBS values were highly correlated (R(2) = 0.85 with bias of -0.010 TBS units). Agreement was less robust comparing Prodigy with iDXA instruments (TBS R(2): 0.72-0.81 with biases of 0.012-0.034 TBS units). In conclusion, TBS precision is comparable to that of BMD and does not differ between men and women. Additionally, in these cohorts, slight TBS differences were observed between iDXA and Prodigy scans. These data suggest a potential difference between densitometer models perhaps due to higher iDXA image resolution. ",0
15210937,T-cadherin is a receptor for hexameric and high-molecular-weight forms of Acrp30/adiponectin,"Acrp30/adiponectin is reduced in the serum of obese and diabetic individuals, and the genetic locus of adiponectin is linked to the metabolic syndrome. Recombinant adiponectin, administered to diet-induced obese mice, induced weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity. In muscle and liver, adiponectin stimulates AMP-activated protein kinase activation and fatty acid oxidation. To expression-clone molecules capable of binding adiponectin, we transduced a C2C12 myoblast cDNA retroviral expression library into Ba/F3 cells and panned infected cells on recombinant adiponectin linked to magnetic beads. We identified T-cadherin as a receptor for the hexameric and high-molecular-weight species of adiponectin but not for the trimeric or globular species. Only eukaryotically expressed adiponectin bound to T-cadherin, implying that posttranslational modifications of adiponectin are critical for binding. An adiponectin mutant lacking a conserved N-terminal cysteine residue required for formation of hexamer and high-molecular-weight species did not bind T-cadherin in coimmunoprecipitation studies. Although lacking known cellular functions, T-cadherin is expressed in endothelial and smooth muscle cells, where it is positioned to interact with adiponectin. Because T-cadherin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored extracellular protein, it may act as a coreceptor for an as-yet-unidentified signaling receptor through which adiponectin transmits metabolic signals.",1
9892646,"A beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase with poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthase activity is structurally related to beta-1,3-galactosyltransferases","Human and mouse cDNAs encoding a new beta-1, 3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (beta3GnT) have been isolated from fetal and newborn brain libraries. The human and mouse cDNAs included ORFs coding for predicted type II transmembrane polypeptides of 329 and 325 aa, respectively. The human and mouse beta3GnT homologues shared 90% similarity. The beta3GnT gene was widely expressed in human and mouse tissues, although differences in the transcript levels were visible, thus indicating possible tissue-specific regulation mechanisms. The beta3GnT enzyme showed a marked preference for Gal(beta1-4)Glc(NAc)-based acceptors, whereas no activity was detected on type 1 Gal(beta1-3)GlcNAc and O-glycan core 1 Gal(beta1-3)GalNAc acceptors. The new beta3GnT enzyme was capable of both initiating and elongating poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains, which demonstrated its identity with the poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthase enzyme (E.C. 2.4.1.149), showed no similarity with the i antigen beta3GnT enzyme described recently, and, strikingly, included several amino acid motifs in its protein that have been recently identified in beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase enzymes. The comparison between the new UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta3GnT and the three UDP-Gal:betaGlcNAc beta-1,3-galactosyltransferases-I, -II, and -III reveals glycosyltransferases that share conserved sequence motifs though exhibiting inverted donor and acceptor specificities. This suggests that the conserved amino acid motifs likely represent residues required for the catalysis of the glycosidic (beta1-3) linkage.",1
15313184,Molecular characterization of a phenanthrene degradation pathway in Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1,"Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1 is capable of degrading a number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to ring cleavage metabolites via multiple pathways. Genes for the large and small subunits of a pyrene dioxygenase, nidA and nidB, respectively, were previously identified in M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 [Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 67 (2001) 3577]. A library of the M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 genome was constructed in a fosmid vector to identify additional genes involved in PAH degradation. Twelve fosmid clones containing nidA were identified by Southern hybridization. Sequence analysis of one nidA-positive clone, pFOS608, revealed a number of additional genes involved in PAH degradation. At this locus, one putative operon contained genes involved in phthalate degradation, and another contained genes encoding a putative ABC transporter(s). A number of the genes found in this region are homologous to those involved in phenanthrene degradation via the phthalic acid pathway. The majority of phenanthrene degradation genes were located between putative transposase genes. In Escherichia coli, pFOS608 converted phenanthrene into phenanthrene cis-3,4-dihydrodiol, and converted 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid into 2'-carboxybenzalpyruvate, 2-carboxybenzaldehyde, and phthalic acid. A subclone containing nidA and nidB converted phenanthrene into phenanthrene cis-3,4-dihydrodiol, suggesting that the NidAB dioxygenase is responsible for an initial attack on phenanthrene. This study is the first to identify genes responsible for the degradation of phenanthrene via the phthalic acid pathway in Mycobacterium species.",0
9869602,Prevalence of the I1307K APC gene variant in Israeli Jews of differing ethnic origin and risk for colorectal cancer,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Israeli Jews of European birth, i.e., Ashkenazim, have the highest colorectal cancer incidence of any Israeli ethnic group. The I1307K APC gene variant was found in 6.1% of American Jews, 28% of their familial colorectal cancer cases, but not in non-Jews. We assessed the I1307K prevalence in Israeli Jews of differing ethnic origin and risk for colorectal cancer. METHODS: DNA samples from 500 unrelated Jews of European or non-European origin, with or without a personal and/or family history of neoplasia, were examined for the I1307K variant by the allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) method. RESULTS: In persons at average risk for colorectal cancer, I1307K was found in 5.0% of 120 European and 1.6% of 188 non-European Jews (P = 0.08). It occurred in 15.4% of 52 Ashkenazi Israelis with familial cancer (P = 0.02) and was not detected in 51 non-European Jews at increased cancer risk. Colorectal neoplasia occurred personally or in the families of 13 of 20 Ashkenazi I1307K carriers, 8 of whom also had a personal or family history of noncolonic neoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: The I1307K APC variant may represent a susceptibility gene for colorectal, or other, cancers in Ashkenazi Jews, and partially explains the higher incidence of colorectal cancer in European Israelis.",1
11015551,Raccoon roundworm (Baylisascaris procyonis) encephalitis: case report and field investigation,"Baylisascaris procyonis is a common and widespread parasite of raccoons in the United States and Canada. With large raccoon populations occurring in many areas, the potential risk of human infection with B procyonis is high. We report a case of severe raccoon roundworm (B procyonis) encephalitis in a young child to illustrate the unique clinical, diagnostic, and treatment aspects, as well as public health concerns of B procyonis infection. Acute and convalescent serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from the patient were tested for antibodies against B procyonis to assist in documenting infection. An extensive field survey of the patient's residence and the surrounding community was performed to investigate raccoon abundance and to determine the extent of raccoon fecal contamination and B procyonis eggs in the environment. The patient evidenced serologic conversion, and the field investigation demonstrated a raccoon population far in excess of anything previously reported. There was abundant evidence of B procyonis eggs associated with numerous sites of raccoon defecation around the patient's residence and elsewhere in the community. Because B procyonis can produce such severe central nervous system disease in young children, it is important that pediatricians are familiar with this infection. The public should be made aware of the hazards associated with raccoons and B procyonis to hopefully prevent future cases of B procyonis infection.",0

Vishnevsky Institute of Surgery in seven patients with limited physical abilities and having to ambulate on crutches for osteosynthesis of the sternum after cardiosurgical interventions we used Ti-Ni fixating cramps with self-regulating compression. This technique provided reliable fixation of the sternum even in the early postoperative period in patients with elevated loading on the shoulder gridle. On day 2-3 after the surgical intervention all patients began to observe the standard motor regimen, i.e., ambulation on crutches. The possibility of early activation in the initially severe cohort of patients with multifocal atherosclerosis and accompanying diseases was one of the factors of an uneventful course of the postoperative period and rapid rehabilitation. Neither sternal instability nor infectious complications during the in-hospital period were observed.",0
20473480,"DRGs and other patient-, service- and area-level factors influencing length of stay in acute psychiatric wards: the Veneto Region experience","PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify services-related and area-based measures together with socio-demographic factors that could improve diagnosis-related groups in explaining length of stay variability in general hospital psychiatric units in Veneto Region (North East of Italy). METHODS: Data were collected from the regional hospital discharge records database. A hierarchical multiple regression model with only diagnosis-related groups as predictors of actual and ln-transformed length of stay was compared with a second model in which patient-, service- and area-level variables were included. Local health district was used as group-level in the hierarchical multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: The only diagnosis explains 6.4% of actual length of stay total variance (14.8% for ln-transformation). In the second model length of stay resulted related also to gender, age, severity of hospitalization, patient's local health district, number of psychiatrists, psychologists, hospital attendants/nurses, social workers and educators in the general hospital psychiatric units, number of outpatients in each local health district and percentages of divorced and single people, with almost a 2% point increase on actual length of stay in explained variance (5% point increase for ln-transformation). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time the hospital discharge card regional survey of all public acute inpatient psychiatric facilities in Veneto Region were used. The innovative aspect of this study was the attempt to investigate the relationship between length of stay and other indexes, characterizing not only the inpatient facilities, but also the resident population structure in each area. The information about factors that influence length of stay can be useful to inform service planning and resource allocation.",0
28606415,Identification of hepatitis B virus A1762T/G1764A double mutant strain in patients in Southern Brazil,"Infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a worldwide public health problem. Chronic HBV infection with high viral replication may lead to cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Mutant HBV strains, such as the HBV A1762T/G1764A double mutant, have been associated with poor prognosis and higher risk of the patient for developing cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. This study analyzed the presence of the HBV A1762T/G1764A double mutant in patients with chronic HBV and its association with clinical parameters such as viral load, aminotransferases, and HBV antigens. A total of 49 patients with chronic hepatitis B were included in the study, and the HBV A1762T/G1764A double mutant strain was detected in four samples (8.16%) by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length analysis (PCR-RFLP). The viral load was not significantly different between patients with or without the double mutant strain (p=0.43). On the other hand, carriers of the HBV A1762T/G1764A double mutant had higher levels of ALT (p=0.0028), while AST levels did not differ between groups (p=0.051). In this study, 75% of the samples with the HBV A1762T/G1764A double mutation were HBeAg negative and anti-HBe positive, reflecting seroconversion even though they still displayed high viral loads. Our study has shown that the HBV A1762T/G1764A double mutant strain circulates in Brazilian patients, and is associated with elevated levels of ALT and HBeAg seroconversion.",0

24810917,Protein-protein interactions in dilute to concentrated solutions: alpha-chymotrypsinogen in acidic conditions,"Protein-protein interactions were investigated for alpha-chymotrypsinogen by static and dynamic light scattering (SLS and DLS, respectively), as well as small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), as a function of protein and salt concentration at acidic conditions. Net protein-protein interactions were probed via the Kirkwood-Buff integral G22 and the static structure factor S(q) from SLS and SANS data. G22 was obtained by regressing the Rayleigh ratio versus protein concentration with a local Taylor series approach, which does not require one to assume the underlying form or nature of intermolecular interactions. In addition, G22 and S(q) were further analyzed by traditional methods involving fits to effective interaction potentials. Although the fitted model parameters were not always physically realistic, the numerical values for G22 and S(q --> 0) were in good agreement from SLS and SANS as a function of protein concentration. In the dilute regime, fitted G22 values agreed with those obtained via the osmotic second virial coefficient B22 and showed that electrostatic interactions are the dominant contribution for colloidal interactions in alpha-chymotrypsinogen solutions. However, as protein concentration increases, the strength of protein-protein interactions decreases, with a more pronounced decrease at low salt concentrations. The results are consistent with an effective ",0
7809124,Structural basis for chromosome X-linked agammaglobulinemia: a tyrosine kinase disease,"X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a hereditary defect of B-cell differentiation in man caused by deficiency of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). A three-dimensional model for the BTK kinase domain, based on the core structure of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, was used to interpret the structural basis for disease in eight independent point mutations in patients with XLA. As Arg-525 of BTK has been thought to functionally substitute for a critical lysine residue in protein-serine kinases, the mutation Arg-525-->Gln was studied and found to abrogate the tyrosine kinase activity of BTK. All of the eight mutations (Lys-430-->Glu, Arg-520-->Glu, Arg-525-->Gln, Arg-562-->Pro, Ala-582-->Val, Glu-589-->Gly, Gly-594-->Glu, and Gly-613-->Asp) were located on one face of the BTK kinase domain, indicating structural clustering of functionally important residues.",1
12226794,Genetic sophistication of human complement components C4A and C4B and RP-C4-CYP21-TNX (RCCX) modules in the major histocompatibility complex,"Human populations are endowed with a sophisticated genetic diversity of complement C4 and its flanking genes RP, CYP21, and TNX in the RCCX modules of the major histocompatibility complex class III region. We applied definitive techniques to elucidate (a) the complement C4 polymorphisms in gene sizes, gene numbers, and protein isotypes and (b) their gene orders. Several intriguing features are unraveled, including (1) a trimodular RCCX haplotype with three long C4 genes expressing C4A protein only, (2) two trimodular haplotypes with two long (L) and one short (S) C4 genes organized in LSL configurations, (3) a quadrimodular haplotype with four C4 genes organized in a SLSL configuration, and (4) another quadrimodular structure, with four long C4 genes (LLLL), that has the human leukocyte antigen haplotype that is identical to ancestral haplotype 7.2 in the Japanese population. Long-range PCR and PshAI-RFLP analyses conclusively revealed that the short genes from the LSL and SLSL haplotypes are C4A. In four informative families, an astonishingly complex pattern of genetic diversity for RCCX haplotypes with one, two, three and four C4 genes is demonstrated; each C4 gene may be long or short, encoding a C4A or C4B protein. Such diversity may be related to different intrinsic strengths among humans to defend against infections and susceptibilities to autoimmune diseases.",1
18427120,Bromodomain 4 activation predicts breast cancer survival,"Previous work identified the Rap1 GTPase-activating protein Sipa1 as a germ-line-encoded metastasis modifier. The bromodomain protein Brd4 physically interacts with and modulates the enzymatic activity of Sipa1. In vitro analysis of a highly metastatic mouse mammary tumor cell line ectopically expressing Brd4 demonstrates significant reduction of invasiveness without altering intrinsic growth rate. However, a dramatic reduction of tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis was observed after s.c. implantation into mice, implying that activation of Brd4 may somehow be manipulating response to tumor microenvironment in the in vivo setting. Further in vitro analysis shows that Brd4 modulates extracellular matrix gene expression, a class of genes frequently present in metastasis-predictive gene signatures. Microarray analysis of the mammary tumor cell lines identified a Brd4 activation signature that robustly predicted progression and/or survival in multiple human breast cancer datasets analyzed on different microarray platforms. Intriguingly, the Brd4 signature also almost perfectly matches a molecular classifier of low-grade tumors. Taken together, these data suggest that dysregulation of Brd4-associated pathways may play an important role in breast cancer progression and underlies multiple common prognostic signatures.",1

All three antisera recognize both in vitro-translated and recombinant, baculovirus-derived BRCA1, which co-migrate with BRCA1 from the human breast epithelia cell line, HBL100. BRCA1 expression and phosphorylation are shown to be cell cycle dependent, with greatest expression and phosphorylation occurring in S and M phases. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and other kinases associated with cyclins D and A are shown to bind to and phosphorylate BRCA1, suggesting that the biological activity of BRCA1 may be regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases.",1
18982352,A large novel deletion in the APC promoter region causes gene silencing and leads to classical familial adenomatous polyposis in a Manitoba Mennonite kindred,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant syndrome caused by the inheritance of germline mutations in the APC tumour suppressor gene. The vast majority of these are nonsense and frameshift mutations resulting in a truncated protein product and abnormal function. While APC promoter hypermethylation has been previously documented, promoter-specific deletion mutations have not been reported. In a large Canadian Mennonite polyposis kindred, we identified a large novel germline deletion in the APC promoter region by linkage analysis and MLPA. By RT-PCR and sequence analysis, this mutation was found to result in transcriptional silencing of the APC allele. A few genetic disorders have been characterized as over-represented in the Manitoba Mennonite population, however, the incidence of cancer has not been recognized as increased in this population as compared to other Manitoba ethnic groups. This study strengthens the likelihood that this novel APC promoter mutation is linked to this unique population as a founder mutation.",1
20042480,Social modulation of learning in rats,"It is well known that emotions participate in the regulation of social behaviors and that the emotion displayed by a conspecific influences the behavior of other animals. In its simplest form, empathy can be characterized as the capacity to be affected by and/or share the emotional state of another. However, to date, relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which animals that are not in direct danger share emotions. In the present study, we used a model of between-subject transfer of fear to characterize the social interaction during which fear is transmitted, as well as the behavioral effects of socially transmitted fear. We found that (1) during social interaction with a recently fear-conditioned partner, observers and demonstrators exhibit social exploratory behaviors rather than aggressive behaviors; (2) learning and memory in a shock-motivated shuttle avoidance task are facilitated in rats that underwent a social interaction with a partner that had been fear conditioned; and (3) a brief social interaction with a recently fear-conditioned partner immediately before fear conditioning increases conditioned freezing measured on the next day. The observed effects were not due to a stress-induced increase in pain sensitivity or analgesia. Collectively, these data suggest that a brief social interaction with a cage mate that has undergone an aversive learning experience promotes aversive learning in an otherwise naive animal. We argue that socially transferred fear is an adaptation that promotes defensive behavior to potentially dangerous situations in the environment.",0
3725872,The potential antineoplastic acting constituents of Physalis alkekengi L. var franchetii Mast,"In a continuing search for potent antineoplastic compounds in indigenous plants, a water extract of Physalis alkekengi L. var. franchetii Mast. fruits was shown to have reproducible antineoplastic activity against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma in mice. Systematic fractionation of the extract led to the isolation of citric acid as the major active principle.",0
3292560,Role of gestational hormones in the induction of insulin resistance,"Pregnancy is associated with insulin resistance. We studied insulin binding and postbinding function in isolated adipocytes from pregnant and nonpregnant rats. We also used a primary culture system for female virgin rat adipocytes to assess the effects of gestational hormones in vitro on insulin binding and postbinding function. Insulin binding to adipocytes was normal during pregnancy, but [14C]3-O-methylglucose transport was reduced. When hCG or estradiol was added to the culture medium, no change in maximum [14C]3-O-methylglucose transport was found; however, maximum insulin binding was increased with estradiol. Progesterone and cortisol both decreased maximum insulin binding and [14C]3-O-methylglucose transport. PRL and placental lactogen decreased maximum [14C]3-O-methylglucose transport, but did not change insulin binding. When these hormones were added concurrently no change in insulin binding was found, but maximum [14C]3-O-methylglucose transport was reduced. We conclude that the insulin resistance of pregnancy is associated with a postbinding defect in insulin action. Estradiol increased insulin receptor binding, but during pregnancy this effect may be offset by the reduction in insulin binding induced by progesterone and cortisol. The postbinding defect in insulin action during pregnancy is probably related to increasing amounts of progesterone, cortisol, PRL, and placental lactogen.",0
8784142,Cerebral white matter is highly vulnerable to ischemia,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The effects of ischemia on the cerebral white matter structure seldom have been studied possibly because white matter is generally considered less vulnerable to ischemia than gray matter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the early (< or = 24 hours) structural effects of experimental focal ischemia on the cerebral white matter of the rat as a preliminary step to investigating human conditions of unknown pathogenesis that are characterized by selective damage to the white matter. METHODS: Twenty-eight rats, including four controls, had a middle cerebral artery occluded with an intravascular filament for periods ranging between 0.5 and 24 hours. Brain samples from the subcortical white matter were examined with light and electron microscopic methods, and the abnormalities were quantified with an image-analysis system. RESULTS: As early as 30 minutes after the arterial occlusion, there was conspicuous swelling of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes; after 3 hours, large numbers of oligodendrocytes were lethally injured. These changes preceded by several hours the appearance of necrotic neurons in the cortex and basal ganglia. Vacuolation and pallor of the white matter were very marked after 24 hours and reflected the segmental swelling of myelinated axons, the formation of spaces between myelin sheaths and axolemma and astrocyte swelling. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the cerebral white matter is highly vulnerable to the effects of focal ischemia. Pathological changes in oligodendrocytes and myelinated axons appear early and seem to be concomitant with, but independent of neuronal perikaryal injury. Modifications of this experimental model of focal ischemia could provide the means to test the hypothesis that selected types of human leukoencephalopathies have an ischemic origin.",0
15554541,Survey on accidental exposure to biological materials in the Hospital-University Complex of Sassari during the period 1995-2000,"To study professional exposure to biological materials an investigation was carried out in the Hospital-University Complex of Sassari during the period January 1st 1995-December 31 2000. 1003 occupational accidents were notified (incidence rate=6%). Infirmaries were the most at risk category (45%) and about the half part of the accidents occurred in surgical area (44.7%). The most frequent accident was needle puncture (53%); exposure involved principally the hands (76.3%). The basal serology of injured personnel showed low positivity for any HBV markers (72.7%), HCV (0.4%) and no positivity for HIV; while high levels were found among source patients. From the comparison between serological data (injured vs source), when ascertainable, emerged a biological hazard of 7.7% for HBV, 30.2% for HCV and 3.2% for HIV; however no seroconversions were observed at follow up. The study also pointed out the need of improve prevention programmes.",0
240717,Acetyl-coenzyme-A carboxylase from rat liver. Subunit structure and proteolytic modification,"The subunit structure of rat liver acetyl-coenzyme-A carboxylase has been studied by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecylsulfate. A number of individual preparations of the enzyme purified by the same procedures exhibited three different types of electrophoretic patterns as follows: first, a single slow-moving protein bands (Mr 230000); secondly, two adjacent fast-moving protein band (M4 124000 and 118 000); finally, all three protein bands. With the use of the [14C]biotin-labelled enzyme, the biotinyl prosthetic group was shown to be associated with the polypeptide of 230000 Mr as well as with that of 124000 Mr, but not with the polypeptide of 118000 Mr. Studies were next made with the labelled enzyme to examine the possibility that the two light polypeptides might have been formed by proteolytic modification of the heavy polypeptide during the procedures used for the purification of the enzyme. Treatment of the enzyme with trypsin or chymotrypsin resulted in cleavage of the heavy polypeptide into two nonidentical polypeptides with molecular weights of approximately 120000. Incubation of the enzyme with proteases derived from rat liver converted the heavy polypeptide into lighter polypeptides of 80000-130000 Mr. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase isolated from crude rat liver extracts by means of immunoprecipitation with specific antibody invariably showed only the heavy polypeptide. The biotin content of the enzyme was found to be 1 mol per 237000 g protein. These results indicate that rat liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase, unlike bacterial and plant biotin enzymes, has only one kind of subunit, which has a molecular weight of 230000 and contains one molecular of biotin. Thus, the mammalian enzyme exhibits a highly integrated subunit structure.",1
33067409,"Identifying best practices in adoption, implementation and enforcement of flavoured tobacco product restrictions and bans: lessons from experts","OBJECTIVE: To identify recommended components for adopting, implementing and enforcing bans or restrictions targeting flavoured tobacco products. METHODS: Between April and June 2019, semistructured interviews were conducted with 17 high-level experts across the USA and Canada with expertise in flavoured tobacco product policies. Participants included health department staff, researchers, legal professionals and local government officials. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed for key themes. RESULTS: Major findings were organised into four categories: programme planning and legislative preparations; education and community outreach; implementation and enforcement; and policy impact. Critical pre-implementation elements included using comprehensive policy language, identifying enforcement agents, examining potential economic costs, deploying media campaigns and engaging community partners and retailers. Recommended implementation processes included a 6-month preparation timeline, focus on retailer education and clearly outlined enforcement procedures, particularly for concept flavours. CONCLUSIONS: Flavoured tobacco policies have successfully limited sales, withstood legal challenges and become more comprehensive over time, providing useful lessons to inform ongoing and future legislative and programmatic efforts. Identifying and sharing best practices can improve passage, implementation, efficacy and evaluation of flavoured tobacco policies.",0
17816630,Sulfide solubilities in alteration-controlled systems,"Solubilities of sphalerite (ZnS) and galena (PbS) were determined at 300 degrees to 500 degrees C and 1000 bars total pressure in a chemical environment buffered by silicate mineral equilibria. Chloride solutions and muscovite-bearing assemblages characteristic of hydrothermal wall-rock alteration were used; weak acidities at temperature were therefore involved. The metal concentrations encountered tended to be higher than those observed in high bisulfide-H(2)S systems at neutral to weakly basic pH used in most previous experimentation; the chemical conditions of the work, although not completely satisfactory, are geologically more realistic than previous experimentation done in the basic-pH region.",0
19863350,Possible risk modification by polymorphisms of estrogen metabolizing genes in familial breast cancer susceptibility in an Indian population,"This case control study investigated whether polymorphisms of estrogen metabolizing genes CYP1A1 MspI, CYP17 MspAI, COMT Val(158) Met, and SULT1A1 Arg(213) His have any role in familial breast cancer susceptibility risk. Logistic regression analysis adjusted to age was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). Familial breast cancer risk due to CYP1A1 wt/m1 and m1/m1 genotypes was 2.3 (1.51-3.61)-fold and 7.1 (3.69-13.7)-fold, respectively. In addition to the main effects, certain first-order interactions were also significantly associated with familial breast cancer. Our results favor a possible risk modification by estrogen metabolizing gene polymorphisms in familial breast cancer susceptibility.",0
31886394,The prevalence of elevated-rim polyethylene liner use in primary total hip arthroplasty in the New York State metropolitan area,"In existing radiographic studies on primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) examining the spino-pelvic effect on THA instability, there is no control of the type of polyethylene liner used, which may be a significant confounder of the results. We sought to determine the prevalence of the use of elevated liners in primary THA using regional implant company sales data. A total of 12,528 liners were analyzed, demonstrating that the overall regional percentage use of lipped liner use is high and varies inversely with larger head sizes. This prevalence data suggests that it is important to consider the use of lipped liners as a confounding variable that should not be overlooked in radiographic studies analyzing cup position and THA instability.",0
19373242,Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring cell death in higher eukaryotes,"Cell death is essential for a plethora of physiological processes, and its deregulation characterizes numerous human diseases. Thus, the in-depth investigation of cell death and its mechanisms constitutes a formidable challenge for fundamental and applied biomedical research, and has tremendous implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to standardize the experimental procedures that identify dying and dead cells in cell cultures and/or in tissues, from model organisms and/or humans, in healthy and/or pathological scenarios. Thus far, dozens of methods have been proposed to quantify cell death-related parameters. However, no guidelines exist regarding their use and interpretation, and nobody has thoroughly annotated the experimental settings for which each of these techniques is most appropriate. Here, we provide a nonexhaustive comparison of methods to detect cell death with apoptotic or nonapoptotic morphologies, their advantages and pitfalls. These guidelines are intended for investigators who study cell death, as well as for reviewers who need to constructively critique scientific reports that deal with cellular demise. Given the difficulties in determining the exact number of cells that have passed the point-of-no-return of the signaling cascades leading to cell death, we emphasize the importance of performing multiple, methodologically unrelated assays to quantify dying and dead cells.",0
19196493,Second primary tumours after a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity or oropharynx using the cumulative incidence method,"The aim of this study was to define the incidence of second primary tumours (SPTs) after treatment of a first primary oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and to define patient groups with an increased or decreased risk of developing SPT with adjustment for competing risks. Cancer registry data from 917 consecutive patients with primary oral or oropharyngeal SCC were reviewed. Outcomes considered were the incidence and location of the SPT. Cumulative incidence was assessed instead of cumulative risks for SPTs. 149 patients (16%) developed a metachronous SPT (median follow-up time 2.6 years). The 5-year and 10-year cumulative incidence was 13% (S.E. 1.2) and 21% (S.E. 1.7), respectively. Most SPT developed in the upper aerodigestive tract (n=65) and lungs (n=35). No statistically significant risk factors were identified when considering patient and index tumour characteristics. The advantage of this study was the large and homogeneous patient population and the correction for competing risks, resulting in a lower but more accurate estimation of the incidence of SPTs. Despite this lower, but still continuous risk, regular follow-up for over 10 years is indicated for all patients treated for cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx.",0
27116021,Development and Validation of Electrochemiluminescence Assays to Measure Free and Total sSLAMF7 in Human Serum in the Absence and Presence of Elotuzumab,"Elotuzumab is a first in class humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Elotuzumab targets the glycoprotein signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family 7 (SLAMF7, also described as CS1 or CRACC) which is expressed on the surface of myeloma cells and a subset of immune cells, including natural killer cells. A soluble version of SLAMF7 (sSLAMF7) has also been reported in MM patients but has not been evaluated as a potential biomarker following therapeutic intervention. In order to measure serum levels of sSLAMF7, two immunoassays were developed to monitor changes in circulating sSLAMF7 before and after elotuzumab treatment. Free (drug-unbound) and total (drug-bound and unbound) electrochemiluminescence (ECL) ELISA assays were developed and validated following a fit for purpose (FFP) methodology. Both assays met analytical acceptance criteria for precision, drug interference, dilution linearity, spike recovery, parallelism, and stability. Both exhibited the range and sensitivity necessary to measure clinical samples with an LLOQ of 51.2 pg/mL and ULOQs of 160 (free) and 800 ng/mL (total). Previously described assays were unable to detect sSLAMF7 in healthy individuals. However, due to the increased sensitivity of these new assays, low but measurable sSLAMF7 levels were detected in all normal healthy sera evaluated and were significantly elevated in MM patients. Cohort statistics revealed a significant increase of circulating sSLAMF7 in MM patients versus normal controls and both significant decreases in free and increases in total levels of protein post-elotuzumab treatment.",0
8723684,Phenotypic expression in double heterozygotes for familial hypercholesterolemia and familial defective apolipoprotein B-100,"Variability in the expression of monogenic lipid disorders may be observed in patients carrying the same DNA mutation, suggesting possible genetic or environmental interactions. Our objective was to investigate the genotype-phenotype relationships in two unrelated French patients with an aggravated expression of a dominantly inherited hypercholesterolemia. In probands, segregation analysis complemented by DNA sequencing identified heterozygous defective alleles and mutations on two nonallelic loci for two monogenic lipid disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia at the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor locus and familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 at the locus encoding its ligand, apolipoprotein B-100. The LDL-receptor missense mutations had been reported in French Canadians. The apolipoprotein B mutation was the Arg3500Gln founder mutation in Northern Europe. Probands had an unusual phenotype of aggravated hypercholesterolemia that was complicated with premature coronary arterial disease, although remaining responsive to lipid-lowering drugs. This phenotype was distinct from that observed in their heterozygous relatives and distinct from those observed in FH or FDB homozygotes. These cases refer to a new class of patients with digenic lipid disorders, defined by specific clinical features that result from the combined effects of two independent loci. Moreover, the observed phenotype of aggravated hypercholesterolemia gives further evidence that receptor and ligand play distinct roles in regulating LDL metabolism. Although uncommon, these cases give insight into the molecular mechanisms that underly the clinical variability of inherited hypercholesterolemia.",1
6779690,Experimental infection of mice with Listeria monocytogenes and L. innocua,"Swiss mice were infected with two Listeria strains: L. monocytogenes strain 10401, serovar 4b, and L. innocua strain 390, serovar 6a. Bacteria were inoculated by intravenous, subcutaneous or oral routes, and then enumerated in the spleen. The splenic infection was studied comparatively for these three inoculation routes with both strains. Strain 390 caused a splenic colonization only after intravenous inoculation. For the 10401 strain, the peak of infection appeared on the 3rd day after inoculation; the intravenous route was the most efficient to kill mice, the subcutaneous one the most efficient to obtain a reproductible sublethal infection; the oral route infected regularly only with doses higher than 10(7) bacteria. A splenomegaly appeared only in mice infected with strain 10401. Estimation of Listeria strain pathogenicity depended more on the measure of bacterial count in the spleen on the 3rd day of infection than on LD50. To be able to compare quantitatively the pathogenicity of L. monocytogenes and L. innocua, it seemed impossible to use only one dose of bacteria and to inoculate through one route.",0
24759821,Laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure: safety and feasibility,"AIMS: The present study aimed to compare the surgical outcomes of patients receiving laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure (RHP) with those receiving open surgery. METHODS: Records of all patients with RHP performed in our unit (including laparoscopic and open surgery) between 2000 and 2012 were retrieved. Data were retrospectively reviewed and compared. RESULTS: Eighty-two RHPs were performed between 2000 and 2012. Thirty-five were performed with an open approach and 47 with a laparoscopic approach. Conversion rate was 28% in the laparoscopic group. There was no difference, between the two groups, in operation time or blood loss. The median length of stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (12 vs 14 days, P = 0.002) and fewer patients in the laparoscopic group had complications with post-operative paralytic ileus (2 vs 17%, P = 0.038). None of the patients in the laparoscopic group developed incisional hernia at the conclusion of follow-up, as opposed to five in the open group (0 vs 14%, P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic RHP is safe and feasible, with more favorable surgical outcomes, when compared with open surgery. Conversion rate is acceptable. It should be the technique of choice for patients undergoing RHP.",0
12692304,Inhibition of rat corneal angiogenesis by a nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer specific for angiopoietin-2,"Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) appears to be a naturally occurring antagonist of the endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2, an important regulator of vascular stability. Destabilization of the endothelium by Ang2 is believed to potentiate the actions of proangiogenic growth factors. To investigate the specific role of Ang2 in the adult vasculature, we generated a nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer that binds and inhibits Ang2 but not the related Tie2 agonist, angiopoietin-1. Local delivery of this aptamer but not a partially scrambled mutant aptamer inhibited basic fibroblast growth factor-mediated neovascularization in the rat corneal micropocket angiogenesis assay. These in vivo data directly demonstrate that a specific inhibitor of Ang2 can act as an antiangiogenic agent.",1
24093946,Multiorder correction algorithms to remove image distortions from mass spectrometry imaging data sets,"Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging is a rapidly evolving technology. Its main application is the study of the distribution of small molecules on biological tissues. The sequential image acquisition process remains susceptible to measurement distortions that can render imaging data less analytically useful. Most of these artifacts show a repetitive nature from tile to tile. Here we statistically describe these distortions and derive two different algorithms to correct them. Both a generalized linear model approach and the linear discriminant analysis approach are able to increase image quality for negative and positive ion mode data sets. Additionally, performing simulation studies with repetitive and nonrepetitive tiling error we show that both algorithms are only removing repetitive distortions. It is further shown that the spectral component of the data set is not altered by the use of these correction methods. Both algorithms presented in this work greatly increase the image quality and improve the analytical usefulness of distorted images dramatically. ",0
11052781,Production of polyclonal antibodies against ochratoxin A and its detection in chilies by ELISA,"Polyclonal antibodies were produced for Ochratoxin A (OA) by injecting OA-bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugate subcutaneously at multiple sites into a New Zealand White inbred rabbit. Antiserum could be used at a dilution exceeding 1:100 000 in an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and detected OA concentrations up to 0.1 ng/mL. The 50% inhibition binding (I(50)) of OA was 5 ng/mL. Antibodies did not react with ochratoxin B, coumarin, 4-hydroxycoumarin, L-phenylalanine, and aflatoxin B1. OA contamination in chilies (Capsicum annum L.) collected from commercial markets and cold storage units was determined. The mean recoveries from OA-free chilies spiked with 1 to100 microg of OA per kg of chili sample were 90-110% with a standard deviation of <10%. Of 100 chili samples tested, 26 were found to contain over 10 microg/kg of OA. In 12 samples the OA concentration varied from 10 to 30 microg/kg, in 10 samples from 30 to 50 microg/kg, in 3 samples from 50 to100 microg/kg, and in one sample it was 120 microg/kg. This is the first record in India of OA in chilies, a major component of cooked foods in this country, and it is noteworthy that OA contamination exceeded the permissible limit for human consumption of less than 20 microg/kg in over 26% of the market samples tested.",0
23343765,Prognostic value of LIPC in non-small cell lung carcinoma,"Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer and is associated with a high mortality rate worldwide. The majority of individuals bearing NSCLC are treated with surgery plus adjuvant cisplatin, an initially effective therapeutic regimen that, however, is unable to prevent relapse within 5 years after tumor resection in an elevated proportion of patients. The factors that predict the clinical course of NSCLC and its sensitivity to therapy remain largely obscure. One notable exception is provided by pyridoxal kinase (PDXK), the enzyme that generates the bioactive form of vitamin B6. PDXK has recently been shown to be required for optimal cisplatin responses in vitro and in vivo and to constitute a bona fide prognostic marker in the NSCLC setting. Together with PDXK, 84 additional factors were identified that influence the response of NSCLC cells to cisplatin, in vitro including the hepatic lipase LIPC. Here, we report that the intratumoral levels of LIPC, as assessed by immunohistochemistry in two independent cohorts of NSCLC patients, positively correlate with disease outcome. In one out of two cohorts studied, the overall survival of NSCLC patients bearing LIPChigh lesions was unaffected, if not slightly worsened, by cisplatin-based adjuvant therapy. Conversely, the overall survival of patients with LIPClow lesions was prolonged by post-operative cisplatin. Pending validation in appropriate clinical series, these results suggest that LIPClow NSCLC patients would be those who mainly benefit from adjuvant cisplatin therapy. Thus, the expression levels of LIPC appear to have an independent prognostic value (and perhaps a predictive potential) in the setting of NSCLC. If these findings were confirmed by additional studies, LIPC expression levels might allow not only for NSCLC patient stratification, but also for the implementation of personalized therapeutic approaches.",0
1251752,A psychosomatic approach to the globus hystericus syndrome,"Twenty patients with lump in the throat as their main subjective symptom, were examined otorhinolaryngologically, radiographically, and psychiatrically with special attention to psychosomatic aspects. The control materials consisted of matched sample subjects of the total population, and of the total patient material treated at a general hospital. A considerably greater number of psychic disturbances were found in globus patients than in the matching control material. The personality picture of the patients was markedly obsessive possibly suggesting a psychosomatic syndrome rather than a pure hysterical conversion syndrome, at least in part of the patients. The globus patients could be divided into two groups, equal in size, according to the presence or absence of psychic disturbances. The group with manifest psychic disturbances had often experienced some significant life incident prior to the appearance of the globus syndrome; they also displayed few somatic findings, which, on the other hand, were abundant in psychically healthy patients.",0
9430630,Bim: a novel member of the Bcl-2 family that promotes apoptosis,"Certain members of the Bcl-2 family inhibit apoptosis while others facilitate this physiological process of cell death. An expression screen for proteins that bind to Bcl-2 yielded a small novel protein, denoted Bim, whose only similarity to any known protein is the short (nine amino acid) BH3 motif shared by most Bcl-2 homologues. Bim provokes apoptosis, and the BH3 region is required for Bcl-2 binding and for most of its cytotoxicity. Like Bcl-2, Bim possesses a hydrophobic C-terminus and localizes to intracytoplasmic membranes. Three Bim isoforms, probably generated by alternative splicing, all induce apoptosis, the shortest being the most potent. Wild-type Bcl-2 associates with Bim in vivo and modulates its death function, whereas Bcl-2 mutants that lack survival function do neither. Significantly, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w, the two closest homologues of Bcl-2, also bind to Bim and inhibit its activity, but more distant viral homologues, adenovirus E1B19K and Epstein-Barr virus BHRF-1, can do neither. Hence, Bim appears to act as a 'death ligand' which can only neutralize certain members of the pro-survival Bcl-2 sub-family.",1
23496196,Prognostic and predictive factors in resected non-small-cell lung cancer,"IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Tumor staging is at present the most important prognostic factor for survival in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recent studies in prognostic and predictive factors have focused on identifying molecular markers. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This paper review current known molecular markers as a prognostic and predictive value. The biomarkers included nucleotide excision repair system (ERCC1, RRM1, BRCA1), cell cycle regulators and apoptosis (p53, p27, bcl-2, KRAS), tumor proliferation (Ki-67), angiogenesis (VEGF, microvessel density), molecular imaging ((18)F-FDG-PET), AKT/mTOR signaling pathway (AKT, mTOR) and EGFR mutation. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Recent study has demonstrated that overexpression of nucleotide excision repair protein is predictive of the resistance of NSCLC to gemcitabine and platinum. Overexpression of p53 and p27 is also a predictive marker for predicting poor outcome after adjuvant chemotherapy. A meta-analysis indicated that VEGF, Ki-67 and (18)F-FDG uptake can be a prognostic factor. Although phospho-Akt and mTOR overexpression are associated with poor outcome, the prognostic significance is still controversial. EGFR mutation is described as being associated with a favorable prognostic factor in resected NSCLC, but it is not an independent factor. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Search for new prognostic/predictive markers remains an important task for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment.",0
11259443,Card10 is a novel caspase recruitment domain/membrane-associated guanylate kinase family member that interacts with BCL10 and activates NF-kappa B,"BCL10 belongs to the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) family of proteins that regulate apoptosis and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Analysis of BCL10-deficient mice has revealed that BCL10 mediates NF-kappaB activation by antigen receptors in B and T cells. We recently identified a subclass of CARD proteins (CARD9, CARD11, and CARD14) that may function to connect BCL10 to multiple upstream signaling pathways. We report here that CARD10 is a novel BCL10 interactor that belongs to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family, a class of proteins that function to organize signaling complexes at plasma membranes. When expressed in cells, CARD10 binds to BCL10 and signals the activation of NF-kappaB through its N-terminal effector CARD domain. We propose that CARD10 functions as a molecular scaffold for the assembly of a BCL10 signaling complex that activates NF-kappaB.",1
6745928,A new alpha 2HS-glycoprotein typing by isoelectric focusing,"Isoelectric focusing (pH 4.0-5.0) of serum alpha 2HS-glycoprotein on polyacrylamide gels has been found to be a useful tool in population genetics and forensic science. Using this method, we isolated three common types, alpha 2HS 1-1, alpha 2HS 2-1 and alpha 2HS 2-2, and showed that alpha 2HS types are determined by two autosomal codominant alleles, alpha 2HS1 and alpha 2HS2. The method is simple, fast and easy to perform. Results of typing for the two alleles, alpha 2HS1 and alpha 2HS2, are described for a Japanese population sample (n = 1003).",1
19967935,Veterinary education in Africa: current and future perspectives,"Veterinary education commenced in South Africa in 1920 at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute in South Africa in association with the Transvaal University College, now the University of Pretoria. Sir Arnold Theiler, Director of Veterinary Research and Education, was the first Dean. Today there are 46 veterinary training institutions in Africa of which 21 are in sub-Saharan Africa. Veterinary services are indispensable to the sustained health and wellbeing of animals and humans, and agricultural economies of countries worldwide. Veterinary education, postgraduate training, and research, and adequate numbers of veterinarians, are essential to satisfy the millennium development goals, the objectives of NEPAD and the African Union, and the agreements regulating international trade. The relevance of the veterinary profession internationally is currently subject to profound scrutiny. Its contributions are assessed against major environmental, demographic, political, disease, technological and economic needs. The scope of veterinary training in future will have to emphasise veterinary public health, food safety, emerging diseases, international trade, bioterrorism, and biomedical research, within the context of a one-health system focusing on the interface between wildlife, domesticated animals, humans, and their environment. Within the context of time available, it would mean reducing the time allocated to training in the field of companion animals. A brief history and scope of veterinary education; current international trends in veterinary education and provisioning; and some perspectives on future veterinary training and initiatives applicable to Africa are provided.",0

CO2 production from labeled beta-alanine was also much reduced, confirming the suspicion that malonic semialdehyde dehydrogenase is also deficient in this condition. An assay for malonic semialdehyde dehydrogenase in cell homogenates showed low activity but it was impossible to assess the degree of reduction.",1
18454451,Cystathionine beta-synthase p.S466L mutation causes hyperhomocysteinemia in mice,"Missense mutations in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene are the most common cause of clinical homocystinuria in humans. The p.S466L mutation was identified in a homocystinuric patient, but enzymatic studies with recombinant protein show this mutant to be highly active. To understand how this mutation causes disease in vivo, we have created mice lacking endogenous mouse CBS and expressing either wild-type (Tg-hCBS) or p.S466L (Tg-S466L) human CBS under control of zinc inducible metallothionein promoter. In the presence of zinc, we found that the mean serum total homocysteine (tHcy) of Tg-S466L mice was 142+/-55 microM compared to 16+/-13 microM for hCBS mice. Tg-S466L mice also had significantly higher levels of total free homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine in liver and kidney. Only 48% of Tg-S466L mice had detectable CBS protein in the liver, whereas all the Tg-hCBS animals had detectable protein. Surprisingly, CBS mRNA was significantly elevated in Tg-S466L animals compared to Tg-hCBS, implying that the reduction in p.S466L protein was occurring due to posttranscriptional mechanisms. In Tg-S466L animals with detectable liver CBS, the enzyme formed tetramers and was active, but lacked inducibility by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). However, even in Tg-S466L animals that had in vitro liver CBS activity equivalent to Tg-hCBS animals there was significant elevation of serum tHcy. Our results show that p.S466L causes homocystinuria by affecting both the steady state level of CBS protein and by reducing the efficiency of the enzyme in vivo.",1
19109166,"Genomic instability resulting from Blm deficiency compromises development, maintenance, and function of the B cell lineage","The RecQ family helicase BLM is critically involved in the maintenance of genomic stability, and BLM mutation causes the heritable disorder Bloom's syndrome. Affected individuals suffer from a predisposition to a multitude of cancer types and an ill-defined immunodeficiency involving low serum Ab titers. To investigate its role in B cell biology, we inactivated murine Blm specifically in B lymphocytes in vivo. Numbers of developing B lymphoid cells in the bone marrow and mature B cells in the periphery were drastically reduced upon Blm inactivation. Of the major peripheral B cell subsets, B1a cells were most prominently affected. In the sera of Blm-deficient naive mice, concentrations of all Ig isotypes were low, particularly IgG3. Specific IgG Ab responses upon immunization were poor and mutant B cells exhibited a generally reduced Ab class switch capacity in vitro. We did not find evidence for a crucial role of Blm in the mechanism of class switch recombination. However, a modest shift toward microhomology-mediated switch junction formation was observed in Blm-deficient B cells. Finally, a cohort of p53-deficient, conditional Blm knockout mice revealed an increased propensity for B cell lymphoma development. Impaired cell cycle progression and survival as well as high rates of chromosomal structural abnormalities in mutant B cell blasts were identified as the basis for the observed effects. Collectively, our data highlight the importance of BLM-dependent genome surveillance for B cell immunity by ensuring proper development and function of the various B cell subsets while counteracting lymphomagenesis.",1
31533491,A new active peptide from Neptunea arthritica cumingii exerts protective effects against gentamicin-induced sensory-hair cell injury in zebrafish,"Gentamicin is commonly used for effective treatment of severe Gram-negative bacterial infections. However, its use is being increasingly restricted owing to the ototoxic effects attributed to it. Gentamicin-induced ototoxicity is thought to be related with apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we found a novel active peptide from Neptunea arthritica cumingii with otoprotective effects and no significant embryotoxic effects. The combined application of gentamicin and this novel active peptide helped sensory-hair cells to protect themselves from lethal ROS accumulation. This, in turn, reduced the expression of three genes (caspase-3, caspase-9, Bax), and thereby, the sensory-hair cell apoptosis promoted by ROS accumulation upon gentamicin administration. Our findings provided new insights into the prevention of gentamicin-induced hearing loss.",0
12741986,Serine 776 of ataxin-1 is critical for polyglutamine-induced disease in SCA1 transgenic mice,"Polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration in transgenic mice carrying the spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) gene is modulated by subcellular distribution of ataxin-1 and by components of the protein folding/degradation machinery. Since phosphorylation is a prominent mechanism by which these processes are regulated, we examined phosphorylation of ataxin-1 and found that serine 776 (S776) was phosphorylated. Residue 776 appeared to affect cellular deposition of ataxin-1[82Q] in that ataxin-1[82Q]-A776 failed to form nuclear inclusions in tissue culture cells. The importance of S776 for polyglutamine-induced pathogenesis was examined by generating ataxin-1[82Q]-A776 transgenic mice. These mice expressed ataxin-1[82Q]-A776 within Purkinje cell nuclei, yet the ability of ataxin-1[82Q]-A776 to induce disease was substantially reduced. These studies demonstrate that polyglutamine tract expansion and localization of ataxin-1 to the nucleus of Purkinje cells are not sufficient to induce disease. We suggest that S776 of ataxin-1 also has a critical role in SCA1 pathogenesis.",1

10469298,Psoriasis upregulated phorbolin-1 shares structural but not functional similarity to the mRNA-editing protein apobec-1,"Earlier studies of psoriatic and normal primary keratinocytes treated with phorbol 12-myristate-1-acetate identified two low-molecular-weight proteins, termed phorbolin-1 (20 kDa; pI 6.6) and phorbolin-2 (17.6 kDa; pI 6.5). As a first step towards elucidating the role of these proteins in psoriasis, we report here the molecular cloning and chromosomal mapping of phorbolin-1 and a related cDNA that codes for a protein exhibiting a similar amino acid sequence. The phorbolins were mapped to position 22q13 immediately centromeric to the c-sis proto-oncogene. Transient expression of the phorbolin-1 cDNA in COS cells and by in vitro transcription/translation, yielded polypeptides that comigrated with phorbolins-1 and -2. Comparative sequence analysis revealed 22% overall identity and a similarity of 44% of the phorbolins to apobec-1, the catalytic subunit of the mammalian apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme; however, recombinant-expressed phorbolin-1 exhibited no cytidine deaminase activity, using either a monomeric nucleoside or apolipoprotein B cRNA as substrate, and failed to bind an AU-rich RNA template. Whereas the precise function of the phorbolins remains to be elucidated, the current data suggest that it is unlikely to include a role in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA in a manner analogous to that described for apobec-1.",1
25681614,Novel GAA mutations in patients with Pompe disease,"Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder linked to GAA gene that leads to a multi-system intralysosomal accumulation of glycogen. Mutation identification in the GAA gene can be very important for early diagnosis, correlation between genotype-phenotype and therapeutic intervention. For this purpose, peripheral blood from 57 individuals susceptible to Pompe disease was collected and all exons of GAA gene were amplified; the sequences and the mutations were analyzed in silico to predict possible impact on the structure and function of the human protein. In this study, 46 individuals presented 33 alterations in the GAA gene sequence, among which five (c.547-67C>G, c.547-39T>G, p.R437H, p.L641V and p.L705P) have not been previously described in the literature. The alterations in the coding region included 15 missense mutations, three nonsense mutations and one deletion. One insertion and other 13 single base changes were found in the non-coding region. The mutation p.G611D was found in homozygosis in a one-year-old child, who presented low levels of GAA activity, hypotonia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Two patients presented the new mutation p.L705P in association with c.-32-13T>G. They had low levels of GAA activity and developed late onset Pompe disease. In our study, we observed alterations in the GAA gene originating from Asians, African-Americans and Caucasians, highlighting the high heterogeneity of the Brazilian population. Considering that Pompe disease studies are not very common in Brazil, this study will help to better understand the potential pathogenic role of each change in the GAA gene. Furthermore, a precise and early molecular analysis improves genetic counseling besides allowing for a more efficient treatment in potential candidates. ",0

30312976,ADAMTS13 Gene Mutations Influence ADAMTS13 Conformation and Disease Age-Onset in the French Cohort of Upshaw-Schulman Syndrome,"BACKGROUND:  Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura (TTP) or Upshaw-Schulman syndrome (USS) is a rare, life-threatening, inherited thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). USS is mostly due to bi-allelic recessive sequence variations of the a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats, member 13 (ADAMTS13) gene inducing a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (activity < 10 IU/dL). In healthy individuals, ADAMTS13 circulates in a folded conformation where CUB domains interact with the spacer domain. The spacer-CUB interaction is abrogated when ADAMTS13 is conformationally activated. OBJECTIVE:  This article evaluates the influence of ADAMTS13 sequence variations on both clinical/biological phenotype and ADAMTS13 conformation in USS. PATIENTS AND METHODS:  All USS patients from the French registry for TMAs (1 January 2000 to 1 June 2017) were investigated for ADAMTS13 genotype, phenotype (activity, antigen and autoantibodies) and conformation. Clinical records were analysed (inaugural acute TTP and follow-up). Child-onset USS was compared with adult-onset USS. RESULTS:  Fifty-six USS patients from 51 families (34 child-onset and 22 adult-onset cases) were enrolled. Child-onset USS was characterized by a large panel of ADAMTS13 sequence variations (n = 43), spread all over ADAMTS13 gene and not correlated with either clinical features or plasmatic ADAMTS13 parameters. In contrast, adult-onset USS, consisting exclusively in pregnancy-induced TTP, included a smaller and distinct panel of ADAMTS13 sequence variations (n = 20) because of one mutation (p.Arg1060Trp) present in 82% of patients. ADAMTS13 conformation was studied in 16 USS patients (5 child-onset and 11 adult-onset USS, encompassing 16 distinct ADAMTS13 sequence variations) whose ADAMTS13 antigen levels were detectable: 14 of 16 patients (87.5%) exhibited abnormalities of ADAMTS13 conformation. CONCLUSION:  In USS, age-onset defines two entities and ADAMTS13 sequence variations modify ADAMTS13 conformation.",1
26083731,The Scorpion Toxin Tf2 from Tityus fasciolatus Promotes Nav1.3 Opening,"We identified Tf2, the first beta-scorpion toxin from the venom of the Brazilian scorpion Tityus fasciolatus. Tf2 is identical to Tb2-II found in Tityus bahiensis. We found that Tf2 selectively activates human (h)Nav1.3, a neuronal voltage-gated sodium (Nav) subtype implicated in epilepsy and nociception. Tf2 shifts hNav1.3 activation voltage to more negative values, thereby opening the channel at resting membrane potentials. Seven other tested mammalian Nav channels (Nav1.1-1.2; Nav1.4-1.8) expressed in Xenopus oocytes are insensitive upon application of 1 muM Tf2. Therefore, the identification of Tf2 represents a unique addition to the repertoire of animal toxins that can be used to investigate Nav channel function. ",0

27761007,Only child syndrome in snakes: Eggs incubated alone produce asocial individuals,"Egg-clustering and communal nesting behaviours provide advantages to offspring. Advantages range from anti-predatory benefits, maintenance of moisture and temperature levels within the nest, preventing the eggs from rolling, to enabling hatching synchrony through embryo communication. It was recently suggested that embryo communication may extend beyond development fine-tuning, and potentially convey information about the quality of the natal environment as well as provide an indication of forthcoming competition amongst siblings, conspecifics or even heterospecifics. Here we show that preventing embryos from communicating not only altered development rates but also strongly influenced post-natal social behaviour in snakes. Clutches of water snakes, Natrix maura, were split evenly into half-clutches and incubated as (1) clusters (i.e. eggs in physical contact with each other) or (2) as single eggs placed in individual goblets (i.e. no physical contact amongst sibling eggs). Single incubated eggs produced less-sociable young snakes than their siblings that were incubated in a cluster: the former were more active, less aggregated and physically contacted each other less often than the latter. Potential long-term effects and evolutionary drivers for this new example of informed dispersal are discussed.",0

20167409,"""""My health has improved because I always have everything I need here..."""": A qualitative exploration of health improvement and decline among immigrants","Immigrants in Canada constitute approximately 20% of the total population and will continue to account for a significant portion of the country's population in the future. Accordingly, a growing body of research has focused on examining the disparity in health status between the increasing foreign-born and the Canadian-born populations. The healthy immigrant effect, in particular, acknowledges that immigrants have better health status than their Canadian-born counterparts upon arrival in the country. However, studies have shown that over time the health of immigrants declines to a level on par with the Canadian-born population. There is much speculation as to the reasons for this decline including acculturation (i.e., uptake of unhealthy lifestyles) and a lack of access to health care. Yet, there have been few studies to examine possible reasons for potential declines in health, especially from the perspective of immigrants themselves. This study is one of the first to qualitatively examine perceived changes in health status and reasons for health status change among immigrants. The paper presents the results of 23 in-depth interviews with adults with recent (less than 3 years of residency), mid-term (3-10 years), and long-term (more than 10 years) immigrants living in the Greater Toronto Area. The results reveal that the majority of the participants believed their health had remained stable or even improved over time due to improved living standards and lifestyle behaviours in Canada. Those who perceived their health to have worsened over time attributed the change to the stress associated with migration, and the aging process rather than the adoption of an unhealthy lifestyle. Additionally, while the vast majority of participants reported improved access to resources upon migration, there were mixed reviews in terms of how beneficial these resources were or could be for health. The findings highlight the need for research to incorporate mental health into studies on changing immigrant health status and to focus on those factors contributing to high levels of stress among more recent immigrants.",0
27646916,Annual Psychological Screening in Youth and Young Adults with Type 1 Diabetes,"AIM: Youth and young adults with type 1 diabetes are at a great risk for developing depression and diabetes specific distress, therefore, systematic psychological screening is recommended. Routine psychological screening was implemented in Slovene diabetes clinic for children, adolescents and young adults in 2012. One-year results are presented. METHODS: Adolescents and young adults (N = 159, aged 11 - 25 years), attending the obligatory yearly educational outpatient visit at University Children's Hospital, Ljubljana, Slovenia, were examined using questionnaires measuring depression (depression scale from Slovene version of Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children) and diabetes distress (Diabetes Distress Screening Scale). Six additional items were included to assess the fear of hypoglycemia and family support. Socio-demographic and diabetes-related data were collected. Questionnaires were analyzed by a psychologist, and the patients that scored above cut-off point were invited to an individual psychological assessment. RESULTS: Of the sample, 1.3 % reached the threshold for elevated depressive symptoms, and 32.7 % reported significant diabetes distress. The need for psychological support from a specialist was expressed by 5.0 %. There were statistically significant associations between all psychological variables; moreover, better glycemic control was associated with lower diabetes distress and better family support. Nine patients (5.7 %) started with psychological treatment according to the referrals after screening. CONCLUSIONS: The results after one year of psychological screening in Slovene type 1 diabetes population displayed small rates of depression and a large proportion of diabetes distress. Only a small percentage of patients attended the offered individual psychological assessment.",0
16161116,Characterization of peptides resulting from digestion of human skin elastin with elastase,"Several pathological disorders are associated with abnormalities in elastic fibers, which are mainly composed of elastin. Understanding the biochemical basis of such disorders requires information about the primary structure of elastin. Since the acquisition of structural information for elastin is hampered by its extreme insolubility in water or any organic solvent, in this study, human skin elastin was digested with elastase to produce water-soluble peptides. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments were performed using conventional electrospray ionization (ESI) and nano-ESI techniques coupled with ion trap and quadrupole time-of-flight (qTOF) mass analyzers, respectively. The peptides were identified from the fragment spectra using database searching and/or de novo sequencing. The cleavage sites of the enzyme and, for the first time, the extent and location of proline hydroxylation in human skin elastin were determined. A total of 117 peptides were identified with sequence coverage of 58.8%. It has been observed that 25% of proline residues in the sequenced region are hydroxylated. Elastase cleaves predominantly at the C-terminals of the amino acids Gly, Val, Leu, Ala, and Ile, and to a lesser extent at Phe, Pro, Glu, and Arg. Our results confirm a previous report that human skin elastin lacks amino acid sequences expressed by exon 26A.",0

Of these, 26 persons from three generations were evaluated clinically. We propose that adrenoleukomyeloneuropathy (ALMN) is a rare, progressive, presumably biochemical disorder of uncertain inheritance. ALMN is expressed clinically by dysfunction of the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and endocrine system. We stress that suspicion of this disorder be high in evaluating uncertain neurologic disorders, and that identification of one manifestation of this complex should alert the clinician to the possibility of a different expression of the same complex in other family members.",1
23131386,Combined microfabrication and electrospinning to produce 3-D architectures for corneal repair,"Corneal stem cell niches are located within the limbus of the eye and are believed to play an important role in corneal regeneration. These niches are often lost in corneal disease or trauma. Our work explores the design of artificial limbal stem cell niches by the fabrication of biodegradable electrospun rings containing bespoke microfeatures. In creating artificial niches, we seek to provide a physically protective environment for limbal cells to act as a cell reservoir for tissue regeneration purposes. This study describes the first step in this challenge to produce structures which structurally approximate to the limbal niches. This was achieved using a combination of electrospinning and microfabrication. Initial microfabricated structures were developed using microstereolithography via a layer-by-layer photocuring approach based on the patterning of photocurable polymers, in this case polyethylene glycol diacrylate. This was then used as a template on which to electrospin a biodegradable membrane of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) 50:50, which incorporates the features of the underlying microfabricated structures. The study describes preliminary evaluation of these constructs using rabbit limbal epithelial and stromal cells.",0
16401568,Geochemical reconnaissance of heavy metals in kaolin after electrokinetic remediation,"The development or implementation of electrokinetic soil remediation technique requires a good knowledge of how the contaminants are retained within the soil-water system. This paper investigates the speciation and extent of migration of the heavy metals, Cr(VI), Cr(III), Ni(II), and Cd(II), during electrokinetic soil remediation. A geochemical assessment of how the contaminants are held within the kaolin soil under induced electric potential is made by using the equilibrium model MINEQL+. The study is performed for three different contaminant cases: the Cr(VI) existing alone in the soil, the Cr(VI) combined with Ni(II) and Cd(II) in the soil, and the Cr(VI) combined with Ni(II) and Cd(II) in the soil in the presence of a reducing agent (sulfide). The adsorption of the studied metals by kaolin was implemented as an electrostatic behavior. FITEQL 4.0 model was used to determine the equilibrium constants of the electrostatic adsorption model of kaolin for the studied metals by optimizing the experimental titration and adsorption data of kaolin. This study showed that the initial speciation of the contaminants in the soil prior to the electrokinetic treatment depends on the type and amounts of contaminants present as well as on the presence of the co-contaminants or any reducing agent. Moreover, the extent of migration of the contaminants is strongly dependent on their initial speciation prior electrokinetic treatment. This study also showed that adsorption and precipitation are the significant hindering mechanisms for the removal of heavy metals from kaolin soil during electrokinetic treatment. The adsorption and precipitation forms of Cr(III), Ni(II), and Cd(II) increased near the cathode and decreased near the anode, whereas the adsorption form of Cr(VI) increased near the anode as well as in the middle region. However, the precipitation form of Cr(III), Ni(II), and Cd(II) as Cr2O3 or Cr(OH)3, Ni(OH)2, and Cd(OH)2, respectively, dominates over their adsorption form as they get closer to the cathode. Overall this study demonstrates that the electrolysis reactions control contaminant speciation and distribution in the soil during electrokinetic remediation because of the generated variations in pH and redox potential in the soil as a result of these reactions.",0

26304102,Transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of early cortical development: An examination of how Pax6 coordinates cortical development,"The development of the cortex is an elaborate process that integrates a plethora of finely tuned molecular processes ranging from carefully regulated gradients of transcription factors, dynamic changes in the chromatin landscape, or formation of protein complexes to elicit and regulate transcription. Combined with cellular processes such as cell type specification, proliferation, differentiation, and migration, all of these developmental processes result in the establishment of an adult mammalian cortex with its typical lamination and regional patterning. By examining in-depth the role of one transcription factor, Pax6, on the regulation of cortical development, its integration in the regulation of chromatin state, and its regulation by cis-regulatory elements, we aim to demonstrate the importance of integrating each level of regulation in our understanding of cortical development.",0
7016719,"On the significance of C2, C4, and factor B polymorphisms in disease","In this review article, recent evidence is presented that some diseases like insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, and idiopathic membranous nephropathy, which are primarily associated with HLA-D,DR, are also related to the rare C2, C4, and Factor B alleles. Circumstantial evidence is available that at least some of these rare variants may be functionally deficient. Based on the concept of functionally interacting gene clusters, mutant complement genes may lead to impaired effector mechanisms in virus neutralization or lysis of virus-infected cells. Other mechanisms such as alteration of vascular permeability may be involved in the development of proliferative retinopathy and familial hypertension. In lepromatous lepra, an impaired cell-mediated lysis of M. leprae may be related to the hemolytically inactive C4F1 allelic product.",1
23301647,Therapeutic results of the treatment brain tumors using radiosurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy,"BACKGROUND: We reviewed the results of treatment of patients treated with stereotactic radiation methods in our department. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with primary brain tumor or brain metastases underwent CT and MR examination. Then they were treated on X knife in the Clinic of Radiation Oncology in Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute Brno. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients with primary brain tumors underwent stereotactic treatment. These were mainly meningeomas, high-grade gliomas and low-grade gliomas. In 37% of cases patients underwent reiradiation. Stereotactic radiosurgery was applied with a median dose of 18 Gy. Hypofrakcionated stereotactic radiotherapy was applied at a doses of mostly 5 x 5 Gy. Total toxicity of treatment was low: 8% acute G1, late toxicity in 1% of cases. In the whole group achieved partial remission 10 patients (9,9%). One patient had complete remission (0,99%). It was a diagnosis of pituitary adenoma. In 69 patients stable disease was observed (68,3%) and 12 patients had progression (11,88%). Median follow up the entire group was 22,4 months. A statistically significant difference in survival was found in the comparison of different diagnosis, patients who received prior radiotherapy and patients without previous irradiation. Another significant difference in survival was observed compared to patients treated with stereotactic treatment or stereotactic radiosurgery and the size of the tumor volume larger / smaller 10 cm3. In the group with brain metastases there were 56 patients. In 10% of cases preceded radiotherapy neurosurgical performance. Twenty four patients underwent cranial irradiation entire dose of 30 Gy. Median stereotactic radiosurgery dose was 20 Gy, the application of stereotactic treatment were mostly of 5 x 5 Gy. G1 acute toxicity occurred in 2 patients (3.8%), grade G2 in one patient (1.9%). Late toxicity was observed in 2 patients (one G1 and one G3). Complete remission was achieved in 4 patients (7.1%), partial remission in 27 patients (48.2%), stable disease in 9 (16.1%) and progression was observed in 5 patients (8.9%). Median follow-up the entire group was 13.3 months. There was no statistically significant difference in survival with respect to gender, age, KI, irradiation of the whole brain or type of treatment used. Patients who have undergone neurosurgery prior to irradiation had no difference in survival compared to patients without surgery, but the time to progression was significantly longer (p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiation methods are part of modern radiotherapy. Their indication is necessary to consider with regard to the benefit of the patient. Quality equipment radiotherapy department and trained personnel are the condition for their correct using.",0

21621605,4-Vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) inhibits mammary epithelial differentiation and induces fibroadenoma formation in female Sprague Dawley rats,"4-Vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), an occupational chemical that targets ovarian follicles and accelerates ovarian failure in rodents, was used to test the effect of early-onset reproductive senescence on mammary fibroadenoma formation. One-month female Sprague Dawley rats were dosed with VCD (80 mg/kg or 160 mg/kg) and monitored for 22 months for persistent estrus and tumor development. Only high-dose VCD treatment accelerated the onset of persistent estrus relative to controls. However, both doses of VCD accelerated mammary tumor onset by 5 months, increasing incidence to 84% (vs. 38% in controls). Tumor development was independent of time in persistent estrus, 17 beta-estradiol, androstenedione and prolactin. Delay in VCD administration until after completion of mammary epithelial differentiation (3 months) did not alter tumor formation despite acceleration of ovarian senescence. VCD administration to 1-month rats acutely decreased mammary alveolar bud number and expression of beta-casein, suggesting that VCD's tumorigenic effect requires exposure during mammary epithelial differentiation.",0
22341969,Germline mutation in ATR in autosomal- dominant oropharyngeal cancer syndrome,"ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related) is an essential regulator of genome integrity. It controls and coordinates DNA-replication origin firing, replication-fork stability, cell-cycle checkpoints, and DNA repair. Previously, autosomal-recessive loss-of-function mutations in ATR have been demonstrated in Seckel syndrome, a developmental disorder. Here, however, we report on a different kind of genetic disorder that is due to functionally compromised ATR activity, which translates into an autosomal-dominant inherited disease. The condition affects 24 individuals in a five-generation pedigree and comprises oropharyngeal cancer, skin telangiectases, and mild developmental anomalies of the hair, teeth, and nails. We mapped the disorder to a  approximately 16.8 cM interval in chromosomal region 3q22-24, and by sequencing candidate genes, we found that ATR contained a heterozygous missense mutation (c.6431A>G [p.Gln2144Arg]) that segregated with the disease. The mutation occurs within the FAT (FRAP, ATM, and TRRAP) domain-which can activate p53-of ATR. The mutation did not lead to a reduction in ATR expression, but cultured fibroblasts showed lower p53 levels after activation of ATR with hydroxyurea than did normal control fibroblasts. Moreover, loss of heterozygosity for the ATR locus was noted in oropharyngeal-tumor tissue. Collectively, the clinicopathological and molecular findings point to a cancer syndrome and provide evidence implicating a germline mutation in ATR and susceptibility to malignancy in humans.",1
28573106,No Functional Role for microRNA-342 in a Mouse Model of Pancreatic Acinar Carcinoma,"The intronic microRNA (miR)-342 has been proposed as a potent tumor-suppressor gene. miR-342 is found to be downregulated or epigenetically silenced in multiple different tumor sites, and this loss of expression permits the upregulation of several key oncogenic pathways. In several different cell lines, lower miR-342 expression results in enhanced proliferation and metastasis potential, both in vitro and in xenogenic transplant conditions. Here, we sought to determine the function of miR-342 in an in vivo spontaneous cancer model, using the Ela1-TAg transgenic model of pancreatic acinar carcinoma. Through longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging monitoring of Ela1-TAg transgenic mice, either wild-type or knockout for miR-342, we found no role for miR-342 in the development, growth rate, or pathogenicity of pancreatic acinar carcinoma. These results indicate the importance of assessing miR function in the complex physiology of in vivo model systems and indicate that further functional testing of miR-342 is required before concluding it is a bona fide tumor-suppressor-miR.",0

32502074,Mental Health Care Utilization and Psychiatric Diagnoses in a Sample of Military Suicide Decedents and Living Matched Controls,"This article examines mental health care utilization and psychiatric diagnoses among US military personnel who died by suicide. We employed an existing electronic health record dataset including 800 US military suicide decedents and 800 matched controls. Suicide decedents were more likely to have received outpatient and inpatient mental health care and to have been diagnosed with depression, bipolar, and nonaffective psychotic disorders. Younger decedents and those in the US Marine Corps were less likely to receive MH care before suicide. Given that approximately half of the suicide decedents in our sample had no mental health care visits before their death, our study suggests the need for programs to increase treatment engagement by at-risk individuals. Such programs could address barriers to care such as stigma regarding mental illness and concerns that seeking mental health care would damage a service member's career.",0
9653649,Identification and characterization of the gene encoding a second proteolipid subunit of human vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (ATP6F),"The proteolipid domain of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) plays a major role in H+ transport in microvesicles and other acidic organelles. We have cloned the second human proteolipid of the V-ATPase (designated hATP6F), a homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteolipid VMA16, which is an essential subunit of yeast V-ATPase. hATP6F is a hydrophobic protein with five putative transmembrane segments, having 61% amino acid identity and 83% similarity to the yeast protein, except in the N-terminus, and contains a conserved glutamic acid residue (Glu98) that is essential for H(+)-transporting activity. The gene for hATP6F (gene symbol, ATP6F), which consists of eight exons and spans approximately 3.5 kb, was isolated and mapped to human chromosome band 1p32.3 and the region 10.81 cR centromeric of the STS marker SHGC36789 (LOD = 6.75) by fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid mapping, respectively. This is the first evidence in human of the existence of a second gene encoding a distinct V-ATPase proteolipid.",1
2936963,"Cloning and expression of human lipocortin, a phospholipase A2 inhibitor with potential anti-inflammatory activity","The anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids has been attributed to the induction of a group of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortin. These proteins are thought to control the biosynthesis of the potent mediators of inflammation, prostaglandins and leukotrienes, by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid, a process that requires phospholipase A2 hydrolysis of phospholipids. Lipocortin-like proteins have been isolated from various cell types, including monocytes, neutrophils and renal medullary cell preparations. The predominant active form is a protein with an apparent relative molecular mass (Mr) of 40,000 (40K). These partially purified preparations of lipocortin mimic the effect of steroids, and mediate anti-inflammatory activity in various in vivo model systems. Using amino-acid sequence information obtained from purified rat lipocortin, we have now cloned human lipocortin complementary DNA and expressed the gene in Escherichia coli. Our studies confirm that lipocortin is a potent inhibitor of phospholipase A2 activity.",1
29784083,"A homozygous loss-of-function CAMK2A mutation causes growth delay, frequent seizures and severe intellectual disability","Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) plays fundamental roles in synaptic plasticity that underlies learning and memory. Here, we describe a new recessive neurodevelopmental syndrome with global developmental delay, seizures and intellectual disability. Using linkage analysis and exome sequencing, we found that this disease maps to chromosome 5q31.1-q34 and is caused by a biallelic germline mutation in CAMK2A. The missense mutation, p.His477Tyr is located in the CAMK2A association domain that is critical for its function and localization. Biochemically, the p.His477Tyr mutant is defective in self-oligomerization and unable to assemble into the multimeric holoenzyme.In vivo, CAMK2A(H477Y) failed to rescue neuronal defects in C. elegans lacking unc-43, the ortholog of human CAMK2A. In vitro, neurons derived from patient iPSCs displayed profound synaptic defects. Together, our data demonstrate that a recessive germline mutation in CAMK2A leads to neurodevelopmental defects in humans and suggest that dysfunctional CAMK2 paralogs may contribute to other neurological disorders.",1
26511183,CRESTAL SINUS LIFT USING A FLUIDO-DYNAMIC COMPUTER GUIDED PRECISE AND ATRAUMATIC TECHNIQUE,"One of the most frequent reasons for failure during the maxillary sinus floor lift operation is connected to the possibility of a rupture of the Schneiderian membrane which, if lacerated, cannot perform the function of graft containment. In order to reduce the incidence of complications it is necessary to cut the hard tissue with extreme accuracy and as little trauma as possible, while saving the soft tissue. The precision of pre-operation measures obtained through endoral x-rays, dental-scans and cone-beam CT allows us to approach and cut with delicacy the sinus cortical floor. The recent development of computer guided surgery gives the possibility of planning the operation, which reduces the risk of failure. The cortical of the maxillary sinus is reduced through the use of calibrated burs and a profiler to obtain a hole that enables both access to the maxillary sinus and, subsequently, the lifting of the Schneiderian membrane. Each stage of the operation is monitored and all the devices used pass through a custom-made template, which acts as a surgical guide. The sinus was filled using fluid biomaterial distributed through a dispenser, which had been created specifically for this technique. Due to the reduction in trauma and the fact that the process is much less invasive, this technique could be a valid alternative to the techniques known and carried out to date. Work time is reduced to less than 3 minutes in the cortical thinning operation and percussive trauma is avoided. ",0
30461732,On-orbit radiometric calibration of Suomi NPP VIIRS reflective solar bands using the Moon and solar diffuser,"Radiometric calibration of the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) reflective solar bands relies mainly on the onboard solar diffuser (SD) observations. The SD reflectance degrades over time due to the exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation. The uncertainties embedded in characterizing the SD bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) directly affect the accuracy of sensor radiometric calibration coefficients, such as F-factors, which are proxies of detector gain. The Moon-based radiometric calibration provides an independent way of validating and correcting the SD-based calibration. This study focuses on the comparison of the long-term SD F-factors with lunar F-factors by using two independent lunar irradiance models, i.e., Miller and Turner (MT) model and the Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System Implementation of ROLO (GIRO) model. To monitor the long-term detector response changes, the lunar F-factor differences are matched to the SD F-factors by applying the best fit scaling factors. Overall, the two lunar F-factors agree well, within 2% of one sigma standard deviation in the reflective solar bands compared to the SD F-factors. The lifetime standard deviations of difference between the GIRO-based lunar and SD F-factors show better long-term match than that of MT-based lunar F-factors. The GIRO-based lunar F-factors show increasing differences over time in comparison with the SD F-factors especially for bands M1 to M4, which indicates the underestimation of the VIIRS detector degradation by SD F-factors for these bands. Using standard SD calibration method and the GIRO-based lunar model, long-term difference between the lunar and SD F-factors shows there are 1.6%, 1.3%, 1.0%, and 0.9% increases in lunar F-factor trend for bands M1 to M4 at the end of year 2015. To mitigate these time-dependent biases, NOAA Ocean Color (OC) group and NASA VIIRS characterization support team (VCST) developed lunar correction methods and applied them to their specific products. However, the amounts of band-dependent lunar corrections are not consistent between these two teams, especially in the short-wavelength bands from M1 to M4, depending on the versions of lunar models and SD F-factor calculation algorithms. Using the standard SD F-factor algorithm and the multi-agency endorsed GIRO model, we derived lunar correction factors based on the quadratic fits between the SD and lunar F-factors. The differences with the NOAA OC group and NASA VCST team are compared and described in this study.",0
7460819,In vivo metabolism of [3H]equilin in the pregnant mare,"[3H]Equilin [3H-labeled 3-hydroxy-1,3,5(10), 7-estratetraen-17-one] was administered iv to a pregnant mare in the 10th month of gestation. Maternal urine was collected for 3 days, and blood samples were taken 35 min and 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after the injection. The half-life of the disappearance of radioactivity from the blood was approximately 2.5 h. Over 90% of the administered dose was excreted in the first 24 h. The urine was extracted, hydrolyzed, and fractionated. The bulk of the radioactive material (75%) was present in the phenolic sulfate fraction from which radiochemically pure equilin, equilenin [3-hydroxy-1,3,5(10),6,8-estrapentaen-17-one], 17 alpha-dihydroequilin [1,3,5(10), 7-estratetraen-3,17 alpha-diol], 17 beta-dihydroequilin [1,3,5-(10,7-estratetraen-3,17 beta-diol], 17 alpha-dihydroequilenin [1,3,5(10),6,8-estrapentaen-3,17 alpha-diol], and 17 beta-dihydroequilenin [1,3,5(10),6,8-estrapentaen-3,17 beta-diol] were isolated and identified. Except for equilenin, the above-named steroids were also isolated and identified from the glucuronide fraction. Along with these estrogens, the two classical estrogens, estrone and 17 alpha-estradiol, were also isolated, but both of these estrogens were devoid of any radioactivity. These results indicate that 1) the B ring unsaturated estrogens are not metabolized to the B ring saturated estrogens (classical estrogens), 2) all of the B ring unsaturated estrogens isolated and identified from the pregnant mare's urine are metabolites of equilin, 3) the major metabolite of equilin excreted in the urine was equilin sulfate, 4) from the specific activity of the isolated equilin sulfate and the amount of [3H]equilin injected, the secretion rate of equilin was calculated to be 96 mg/24 h, and 5) the major reduced metabolites of equilin are the biologically less active 17 alpha-reduced products.",0
10581174,Genomic organization of the human gamma adducin gene,"We report the genomic structure of the human gamma adducin gene (ADD3). Adducin is a protein involved in cytoskeletal assembly and composed of alpha-beta or alpha-gamma subunits which share a high degree of homology between human and rat. Mutations in alpha subunit have been shown associated to both human and rat hypertension. The human ADD3 gene spans over 20 kb and is composed of at least 13 introns and 14 exons covering the entire coding region. The exon size ranges from 81 bp to greater than 293 bp and the intron size from 111 bp to longer than 3.2 kb. We also demonstrate the presence of an alternative splicing event around exon 13, whose sequence, position, and expression is analogous in rat Add3 gene. Moreover, human ADD3 amino acid sequence presents 91.9% of identity compared to rat sequence. Characterization of human ADD3 gene provides an important tool for mutation analysis.",1

12558953,Jaw bone remodeling at the invasion front of gingival squamous cell carcinomas,"BACKGROUND: It is still unknown how jaw bone remodeling occurs at actual invasion sites of oral squamous cell carcinomas. Since there is no other human carcinomas which make a direct invasion of the bone, gingival carcinomas are valuable examples. METHODS: Twelve surgical specimens of gingival squamous cell carcinoma were examined histopathologically and immunohistochemically for remodeling of bone and its surrounding tissue. RESULTS: Three types of bone interfaces with carcinomatous invasion were distinguished. These included areas with bone resorption, smooth bone surface and new bone formation. In the bone-resorption area, numerous osteoclasts were located along the bone surface, which was surrounded by myxoid stroma. The myxoid stroma was characterized by immunopositivity for heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), abundant vascularity and macrophagic infiltration. In the bone-formation area, rows of osteoblasts were aligned on the bone surface. The stroma around osteoblasts was also HSPG-immunopositive, poor in vascularity but rich in activated fibroblasts. In the smooth-bone area, the stroma showed an organizing phase of granulation tissue with slender fibroblasts and mature collagen fibers but with less vascularity and inflammatory infiltrates. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the stromal architecture, especially in terms of its inflammatory cellular, vascular and matrix compositions, is strictly regulated in the timing and site of jaw bone remodeling which is causes by carcinomatous invasion.",0
18849347,BEST1 expression in the retinal pigment epithelium is modulated by OTX family members,"A number of genes preferentially expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are associated with retinal degenerative disease. One of these, BEST1, encodes bestrophin-1, a protein that when mutated causes Best macular dystrophy. As a model for RPE gene regulation, we have been studying the mechanisms that control BEST1 expression, and recently demonstrated that members of the MITF-TFE family modulate BEST1 transcription. The human BEST1 upstream region from -154 to +38 bp is sufficient to direct expression in the RPE, and positive-regulatory elements exist between -154 and -104 bp. Here, we show that the -154 to -104 bp region is necessary for RPE expression in transgenic mice and contains a predicted OTX-binding site (Site 1). Since another non-canonical OTX site (Site 2) is located nearby, we tested the function of these sites using BEST1 promoter/luciferase constructs by in vivo electroporation and found that mutation of both sites reduces promoter activity. Three OTX family proteins - OTX1, OTX2 and CRX - bound to both Sites 1 and 2 in vitro, and all of them increased BEST1 promoter activity. Surprisingly, we found that human and bovine RPE expressed not only OTX2 but also CRX, the CRX genomic region in bovine RPE was hypersensitive to DNase I, consistent with active transcription, and that both OTX2 and CRX bound to the BEST1 proximal promoter in vivo. These results demonstrate for the first time CRX expression in the RPE, and suggest that OTX2 and CRX may act as positive modulators of the BEST1 promoter in the RPE.",1

8389915,Temperature-sensitive mouse cell factors for strand-specific initiation of poliovirus RNA synthesis,"Two cell lines, TgSVA and TgSVB, were established from the kidneys of transgenic mice carrying the human gene encoding poliovirus receptor. The cells were highly susceptible to poliovirus infection, and a large amount of infectious particles was produced in the infected cells at 37 degrees C. However, the virus yield was greatly reduced at 40 degrees C. This phenomenon was common to all mouse cells tested. To identify the temperature-sensitive step(s) of the virus infection cycle, different steps of the infection cycle were examined for temperature sensitivity. The results strongly suggested that the growth restriction observed at 40 degrees C was due to reduced efficiency of the initiation process of virus-specific RNA synthesis. Furthermore, this restriction appeared to occur only on the synthesis of positive-strand RNA. Virus-specific RNA synthesis in crude replication complexes was not affected by the nonpermissive temperature of 40 degrees C. In vitro uridylylation of VPg seemed to be temperature sensitive only after prolonged incubation at 40 degrees C. These results indicate that a specific host factor(s) is involved in the efficient initiation process of positive-strand RNA synthesis of poliovirus and that the host factor(s) is temperature sensitive in TgSVA and TgSVB cells.",0

Although the diagnosis is generally made with a high degree of accuracy, the pathophysiology of IBS remains elusive, and treatment can be frustrating for both patient and physician alike. Important areas of research focus on the psychology of IBS, visceral hypersensitivity, motility abnormalities (e.g., heightened gastrocolonic response), and the ",0
10615133,Mutations in a new photoreceptor-pineal gene on 17p cause Leber congenital amaurosis,"Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA, MIM 204000) accounts for at least 5% of all inherited retinal disease and is the most severe inherited retinopathy with the earliest age of onset. Individuals affected with LCA are diagnosed at birth or in the first few months of life with severely impaired vision or blindness, nystagmus and an abnormal or flat electroretinogram (ERG). Mutations in GUCY2D (ref. 3), RPE65 (ref. 4) and CRX (ref. 5) are known to cause LCA, but one study identified disease-causing GUCY2D mutations in only 8 of 15 families whose LCA locus maps to 17p13.1 (ref. 3), suggesting another LCA locus might be located on 17p13.1. Confirming this prediction, the LCA in one Pakistani family mapped to 17p13.1, between D17S849 and D17S960-a region that excludes GUCY2D. The LCA in this family has been designated LCA4 (ref. 6). We describe here a new photoreceptor/pineal-expressed gene, AIPL1 (encoding aryl-hydrocarbon interacting protein-like 1), that maps within the LCA4 candidate region and whose protein contains three tetratricopeptide (TPR) motifs, consistent with nuclear transport or chaperone activity. A homozygous nonsense mutation at codon 278 is present in all affected members of the original LCA4 family. AIPL1 mutations may cause approximately 20% of recessive LCA, as disease-causing mutations were identified in 3 of 14 LCA families not tested previously for linkage.",1
21944778,Expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in noncoding region of C9ORF72 causes chromosome 9p-linked FTD and ALS,"Several families have been reported with autosomal-dominant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), genetically linked to chromosome 9p21. Here, we report an expansion of a noncoding GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in the gene C9ORF72 that is strongly associated with disease in a large FTD/ALS kindred, previously reported to be conclusively linked to chromosome 9p. This same repeat expansion was identified in the majority of our families with a combined FTD/ALS phenotype and TDP-43-based pathology. Analysis of extended clinical series found the C9ORF72 repeat expansion to be the most common genetic abnormality in both familial FTD (11.7%) and familial ALS (23.5%). The repeat expansion leads to the loss of one alternatively spliced C9ORF72 transcript and to formation of nuclear RNA foci, suggesting multiple disease mechanisms. Our findings indicate that repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is a major cause of both FTD and ALS.",1

9589672,A recurrent missense mutation in the KAL gene in patients with X-linked Kallmann's syndrome,"Kallmann's syndrome (KS) is defined by the association of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia or hyposmia. Segregation analysis in familial cases has demonstrated diverse inheritance patterns, suggesting the existence of several genes regulating GnRH secretion. Genetic defects have been demonstrated in the KAL gene, located on the Xp22.3 region, explaining the X-linked form of the disease. We report molecular findings regarding the KAL gene in 12 unrelated males with X-linked KS. PCR of the 14 exons of the KAL gene was performed on genomic DNA. PCR products of all exons were purified and sequenced. Genetic defects in the KAL gene were found in 7 patients. One exhibits a deletion from exon 3 to exon 5. Six individuals present a previously unidentified missense mutation in exon 11, consisting of a G to A substitution at codon 514 (GAA to AAA). In the remaining 5 individuals, no mutations were observed. We also found three different polymorphic changes. The first one, in exon 2, had not been reported previously. The other two were located at exons 11 and 12. The deletion described, comprises only part (exon 5) of the coding region of the first fibronectin type III-like repeat of the KAL protein. The rest of the deletion comprises part of the conserved cysteine-rich N-terminal region that corresponds to the whey acidic protein motif. The same missense mutation was found in 6 of the 12 patients, indicating the possibility that it derived from a common ancestor or suggesting the presence of a hot spot in this region of the gene.",1
18690386,Differential expressions of nNOS and iNOS in the rostral ventrolateral medulla induced by electroacupuncture in acute myocardial ischemia rats,"Increasing lines of evidence has been accumulated that nitric oxide (NO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) distribute plentifully in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) and contribute to cardiovascular regulation. In the present study, the expressions of neuronal and inducible isoform of NOS (nNOS and iNOS) were observed in the RVLM of acute myocardial ischemia (AMI) Wistar rats experienced electroacupuncture (EA) treatment, thereby the cardiovascular effects of NO in the RVLM were investigated and the mechanism of acupuncture effect on AMI was inferred. The results indicated that in the AMI rats, cardiac functions were markedly attenuated with high serum level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and norepinephine (NE), the number of nNOS-immunoreactive cells and nNOS mRNA exprossion in the RVLM area were increased, while those of iNOS were lowered.

30842655,p53 regulation of ammonia metabolism through urea cycle controls polyamine biosynthesis,"Cancer cells exhibit altered and usually increased metabolic processes to meet their high biogenetic demands(1,2). Under these conditions, ammonia is concomitantly produced by the increased metabolic processing. However, it is unclear how tumour cells dispose of excess ammonia and what outcomes might be caused by the accumulation of ammonia. Here we report that the tumour suppressor p53, the most frequently mutated gene in human tumours, regulates ammonia metabolism by repressing the urea cycle. Through transcriptional downregulation of CPS1, OTC and ARG1, p53 suppresses ureagenesis and elimination of ammonia in vitro and in vivo, leading to the inhibition of tumour growth. Conversely, downregulation of these genes reciprocally activates p53 by MDM2-mediated mechanism(s). Furthermore, the accumulation of ammonia causes a significant decline in mRNA translation of the polyamine biosynthetic rate-limiting enzyme ODC, thereby inhibiting the biosynthesis of polyamine and cell proliferation. Together, these findings link p53 to ureagenesis and ammonia metabolism, and further reveal a role for ammonia in controlling polyamine biosynthesis and cell proliferation.",1
32817414,Multiomic blood correlates of genetic risk identify presymptomatic disease alterations,"Transitions from health to disease are characterized by dysregulation of biological networks under the influence of genetic and environmental factors, often over the course of years to decades before clinical symptoms appear. Understanding these dynamics has important implications for preventive medicine. However, progress has been hindered both by the difficulty of identifying individuals who will eventually go on to develop a particular disease and by the inaccessibility of most disease-relevant tissues in living individuals. Here we developed an alternative approach using polygenic risk scores (PRSs) based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 54 diseases and complex traits coupled with multiomic profiling and found that these PRSs were associated with 766 detectable alterations in proteomic, metabolomic, and standard clinical laboratory measurements (clinical labs) from blood plasma across several thousand mostly healthy individuals. We recapitulated a variety of known relationships (e.g., glutamatergic neurotransmission and inflammation with depression, IL-33 with asthma) and found associations directly suggesting therapeutic strategies (e.g., Omega-6 supplementation and IL-13 inhibition for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and influences on longevity (leukemia inhibitory factor, ceramides). Analytes altered in high-genetic-risk individuals showed concordant changes in disease cases, supporting the notion that PRS-associated analytes represent presymptomatic disease alterations. Our results provide insights into the molecular pathophysiology of a range of traits and suggest avenues for the prevention of health-to-disease transitions.",0
29981750,"Notoginsenoside R1, a unique constituent of Panax notoginseng, blinds proinflammatory monocytes to protect against cardiac hypertrophy in ApoE(-/-) mice","Notoginsenoside R1, a unique constituent from the root of Panax notoginseng, exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic properties. The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of the anti-inflammatory effects of R1 to the amelioration of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced hypertrophied hearts of atherosclerosis-prone mice. As a model of in vivo atherosclerosis, ApoE(-/-) C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 12 weeks. Intraperitoneal injection of R1 (1-50mg/kg/day) or saline for 7 days was followed by continuous infusion with ISO (25mg/kg/day) for 14 days to experimentally induce heart hypertrophy. We assessed fibrosis, myocardial function, and protein or mRNA levels of several inflammatory mediators. ISO infusion induced cardiac ventricular contractile and diastolic dysfunction, which was consistent with massive replacement fibrosis and apoptosis in hypertrophied hearts. However, R1 attenuated ISO-induced hypertrophy. R1 suppressed the expression of CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) and prevented Ly6C(high) proinflammatory monocytes and the subsequent myocardial inflammatory responses and expression of various cell-derived factors around the cardiac wound. R1-supressed cardiac dysfunction, atherosclerotic lesions, and inflammatory cytokine accumulation in the myocardium can be partially inhibited by CCR2 translation in bone marrow cells. R1 is a novel cardioprotective agent that can attenuate adverse cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy, and associated disorders, such as fibrosis. The mechanisms are closely correlated with CCR2, which plays a crucial role in the recruitment of proinflammatory monocytes to sites of inflamed hypertrophic heart tissues.",0

They evaluated the effect of the two doses on the urinary excretion of PGI and TXA2 metabolites as well as the effect on proteinuria and glomerular filtraction (GF). The authors provided evidence that small and very small amounts of ACA did not affect the excretion of the PGI metabolite, while they reduced significantly the excretion of the TXA2 metabolite and of proteinuria, and significantly increased GF.",0
26479315,Deletion of murine Arv1 results in a lean phenotype with increased energy expenditure,"BACKGROUND: ACAT-related enzyme 2 required for viability 1 (ARV1) is a putative lipid transporter of the endoplasmic reticulum that is conserved across eukaryotic species. The ARV1 protein contains a conserved N-terminal cytosolic zinc ribbon motif known as the ARV1 homology domain, followed by multiple transmembrane regions anchoring it in the ER. Deletion of ARV1 in yeast results in defective sterol trafficking, aberrant lipid synthesis, ER stress, membrane disorganization and hypersensitivity to fatty acids (FAs). We sought to investigate the role of Arv1 in mammalian lipid metabolism. METHODS: Homologous recombination was used to disrupt the Arv1 gene in mice. Animals were examined for alterations in lipid and lipoprotein levels, body weight, body composition, glucose tolerance and energy expenditure. RESULTS: Global loss of Arv1 significantly decreased total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the plasma. Arv1 knockout mice exhibited a dramatic lean phenotype, with major reductions in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass and body weight on a chow diet. This loss of WAT is accompanied by improved glucose tolerance, higher adiponectin levels, increased energy expenditure and greater rates of whole-body FA oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: This work identifies Arv1 as an important player in mammalian lipid metabolism and whole-body energy homeostasis.",1
10441325,ATP2A2 mutations in Darier's disease and their relationship to neuropsychiatric phenotypes,"Darier's disease (DD) is a rare, dominantly inherited disorder that affects the skin producing a variety of types of lesion. Close examination of lesional DD skin shows the presence of abnormal keratinization (epidermal differentiation) and acantholysis (loss of cohesion) of keratinocytes. A number of clinical studies have described the co-occurrence of various neurological and psychiatric symptoms with DD, including mood disorders, epilepsy, mental retardation and a slowly progressive encephalopathy. A single locus for DD has been mapped to chromosome 12q23-q24.1, and a variety of missense, nonsense, frameshift and splicing mutations in the ATP2A2 gene have been described recently in families with DD. This gene encodes the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-pumping ATPase SERCA2, which has a central role in intra-cellular calcium signalling. In this study, we performed mutation analysis on ATP2A2 in 19 unrelated DD patients, of whom 10 had neuropsychiatric phenotypes. We identified and verified 17 novel mutations predicting conservative and non-conservative amino acid changes, potential premature translation terminations and potential altered splicing. Our findings confirm that mutations in ATP2A2 are associated with DD. In neuropsychiatric cases, there was a non-random clustering of mutations in the 3' end of the gene ( P = 0.01), and a predominance of the missense type (70% versus 38% in DD patients). This supports the hypothesis that the DD gene has pleiotropic effects in brain and that mutations in SERCA2 are implicated in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders.",1

11278692,CARD11 and CARD14 are novel caspase recruitment domain (CARD)/membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family members that interact with BCL10 and activate NF-kappa B,"The caspase recruitment domain (CARD) is a protein-binding module that mediates the assembly of CARD-containing proteins into apoptosis and NF-kappaB signaling complexes. We report here that CARD protein 11 (CARD11) and CARD protein 14 (CARD14) are novel CARD-containing proteins that belong to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, a class of proteins that functions as molecular scaffolds for the assembly of multiprotein complexes at specialized regions of the plasma membrane. CARD11 and CARD14 have homologous structures consisting of an N-terminal CARD domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal tripartite domain comprised of a PDZ domain, an Src homology 3 domain, and a GUK domain with homology to guanylate kinase. The CARD domains of both CARD11 and CARD14 associate specifically with the CARD domain of BCL10, a signaling protein that activates NF-kappaB through the IkappaB kinase complex in response to upstream stimuli. When expressed in cells, CARD11 and CARD14 activate NF-kappaB and induce the phosphorylation of BCL10. These findings suggest that CARD11 and CARD14 are novel MAGUK family members that function as upstream activators of BCL10 and NF-kappaB signaling.",1
16116423,The DNA helicase BRIP1 is defective in Fanconi anemia complementation group J,"The protein predicted to be defective in individuals with Fanconi anemia complementation group J (FA-J), FANCJ, is a missing component in the Fanconi anemia pathway of genome maintenance. Here we identify pathogenic mutations in eight individuals with FA-J in the gene encoding the DEAH-box DNA helicase BRIP1, also called FANCJ. This finding is compelling evidence that the Fanconi anemia pathway functions through a direct physical interaction with DNA.",1
16287142,Identification of genetic aberrations on chromosome 22 outside the NF2 locus in schwannomatosis and neurofibromatosis type 2,"Schwannomatosis is characterized by multiple peripheral and cranial nerve schwannomas that occur in the absence of bilateral 8th cranial nerve schwannomas. The latter is the main diagnostic criterion of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), which is a related but distinct disorder. The genetic factors underlying the differences between schwannomatosis and NF2 are poorly understood, although available evidence implicates chromosome 22 as the primary location of the gene(s) of interest. To investigate this, we comprehensively profiled the DNA copy number in samples from sporadic and familial schwannomatosis, NF2, and a large cohort of normal controls. Using a tiling-path chromosome 22 genomic array, we identified two candidate regions of copy number variation, which were further characterized by a PCR-based array with higher resolution. The latter approach allows the detection of minute alterations in total genomic DNA, with as little as 1.5 kb per measurement point of nonredundant sequence on the array. In DNA derived from peripheral blood from a schwannomatosis patient and a sporadic schwannoma sample, we detected rearrangements of the immunoglobulin lambda (IGL) locus, which is unlikely to be due to a B-cell specific somatic recombination of IGL. Analysis of normal controls indicated that these IGL rearrangements were restricted to schwannomatosis/schwannoma samples. In the second candidate region spanning GSTT1 and CABIN1 genes, we observed a frequent copy number polymorphism at the GSTT1 locus. We further describe missense mutations in the CABIN1 gene that are specific to samples from schwannomatosis and NF2 and make this gene a plausible candidate for contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders.",1
9933977,Bioactive agents from natural sources: trends in discovery and application,"About 30% of the worldwide sales of drugs are based on natural products. Though recombinant proteins and peptides account for increasing sales rates, the superiority of low-molecular mass compounds in human diseases therapy remains undisputed mainly due to more favorable compliance and bioavailability properties. In the past, new therapeutic approaches often derived from natural products. Numerous examples from medicine impressively demonstrate the innovative potential of natural compounds and their impact on progress in drug discovery and development. However, natural products are currently undergoing a phase of reduced attention in drug discovery because of the enormous effort which is necessary to isolate the active principles and to elucidate their structures. To meet the demand of several hundred thousands of test samples that have to be submitted to high-throughput screening (HTS) new strategies in natural product chemistry are necessary in order to compete successfully with combinatorial chemistry. Today, pharmaceutical companies have to spend approximately US $350 million to develop a new drug. Currently, approaches to improve and accelerate the joint drug discovery and development process are expected to arise mainly from innovation in drug target elucidation and lead finding. Breakthroughs in molecular biology, cell biology, and genetic engineering in the 1980 s gave access to understanding diseases on the molecular or on the gene level. Subsequently, constructing novel target directed screening assay systems of promising therapeutic significance, automation, and miniaturization resulted in HTS approaches changing the industrial drug discovery process drastically. Furthermore, elucidation of the human genome will provide access to a dramatically increased number of new potential drug targets that have to be evaluated for drug discovery. HTS enables the testing of an increasing number of samples. Therefore, new concepts to generate large compound collections with improved structural diversity are desirable.",0
1631143,Molecular basis of AMP deaminase deficiency in skeletal muscle,"AMP deaminase (AMPD; EC 3.5.4.6) is encoded by a multigene family in mammals. The AMPD1 gene is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle, where this enzyme is thought to play an important role in energy metabolism. Deficiency of AMPD activity in skeletal muscle is associated with symptoms of a metabolic myopathy. Eleven unrelated individuals with AMPD deficiency were studied, and each was shown to be homozygous for a mutant allele characterized by a C----T transition at nucleotide 34 (codon 12 in exon 2) and at nucleotide 143 (codon 48 in exon 3). The C----T transition at codon 12 results in a nonsense mutation predicting a severely truncated AMPD peptide. Consistent with this prediction, no immunoreactive AMPD1 peptide is detectable in skeletal muscle of these patients. This mutant allele is found in 12% of Caucasians and 19% of African-Americans, whereas none of the 106 Japanese subjects surveyed has this mutant allele. We conclude from these studies that this mutant allele is present at a sufficiently high frequency to account for the 2% reported incidence of AMPD deficiency in muscle biopsies. The restricted distribution and high frequency of this doubly mutated allele suggest it arose in a remote ancestor of individuals of Western European descent.",1
19608551,Potential late-onset Alzheimer's disease-associated mutations in the ADAM10 gene attenuate {alph,"ADAM10, a member of a disintegrin and metalloprotease family, is an alpha-secretase capable of anti-amyloidogenic proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein. Here, we present evidence for genetic association of ADAM10 with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as two rare potentially disease-associated non-synonymous mutations, Q170H and R181G, in the ADAM10 prodomain. These mutations were found in 11 of 16 affected individuals (average onset age 69.5 years) from seven late-onset AD families. Each mutation was also found in one unaffected subject implying incomplete penetrance. Functionally, both mutations significantly attenuated alpha-secretase activity of ADAM10 (>70% decrease), and elevated Abeta levels (1.5-3.5-fold) in cell-based studies. In summary, we provide the first evidence of ADAM10 as a candidate AD susceptibility gene, and report two potentially pathogenic mutations with incomplete penetrance for late-onset familial AD.",1

15659831,Effect of dietary restriction on DNA synthesis in vitamin E-deficient rats,"To assess the effect of dietary restriction on increased oxidative stress conditions, we measured the proliferative response of spleen lymphocytes from the following groups of adult rats: (1) control fed ad libitum (14 months of age); (2) vitamin E-deficient (12 months of age); and (3) vitamin E-deficient maintained on dietary restricted paradigm, that is, every other day schedule (12 months of age) animals. No significant change was observed among the three groups investigated at 24 h. At 48 h, [(3)H]thymidine incorporation was significantly lower in vitamin E-deficient rats vs. the other groups at Con A concentrations of 1 and 5 mug/mL, while at Con A concentration of 10 mug/mL the incorporation of the labeled compound in lymphocytes was significantly lower than only the vitamin E-deficient rats vs. controls. At 72 h: nonstimulated lymphocytes from ad libitum fed control rats showed significant higher values of [(3)H]thymidine incorporation vs. the other groups; no significant difference was found among the three groups investigated at 1 and 10 mug/mL Con A concentrations, while at 5 mug/mL Con A concentration, the lymphocytes from vitamin E-deficient rats showed a significant lower value of [(3)H]thymidine incorporation vs. the other groups. These data support that vitamin E-deficiency impairs the proliferative response of spleen lymphocytes from adult rats, while dietary restriction appears to be able to reverse this alteration. Although the mechanism(s) of action of dietary restriction in prolonging the life span and ameliorating health conditions are not know, it is currently supported that a reduced food intake results in a better control of free radical attacks to biological molecules as well as to several cellular and system functions. With specific reference to the present findings, dietary restriction may help the mitotic process dynamics to be accomplished in a condition of low rate of free radical damage, thus representing a physiological intervention capable of modulating positively the proliferative capacity of spleen lymphocytes and, in turn, the immune system, even in adverse conditions such as increased oxidative stress.",0
15750596,The chemokine receptor D6 limits the inflammatory response in vivo,"How the inflammatory response is initiated has been well defined but relatively little is known about how such responses are resolved. Here we show that the D6 chemokine receptor is involved in the post-inflammatory clearance of beta-chemokines from cutaneous sites. After induction of inflammation by phorbol esters, wild-type mice showed a transient inflammatory response. However, in D6-deficient mice, an excess concentration of residual chemokines caused a notable inflammatory pathology with similarities to human psoriasis. These results suggest that D6 is involved in the resolution of the cutaneous inflammatory response.",1
28459430,Chemotherapy drugs induce pyroptosis through caspase-3 cleavage of a gasdermin,"Pyroptosis is a form of cell death that is critical for immunity. It can be induced by the canonical caspase-1 inflammasomes or by activation of caspase-4, -5 and -11 by cytosolic lipopolysaccharide. The caspases cleave gasdermin D (GSDMD) in its middle linker to release autoinhibition on its gasdermin-N domain, which executes pyroptosis via its pore-forming activity. GSDMD belongs to a gasdermin family that shares the pore-forming domain. The functions and mechanisms of activation of other gasdermins are unknown. Here we show that GSDME, which was originally identified as DFNA5 (deafness, autosomal dominant 5), can switch caspase-3-mediated apoptosis induced by TNF or chemotherapy drugs to pyroptosis. GSDME was specifically cleaved by caspase-3 in its linker, generating a GSDME-N fragment that perforates membranes and thereby induces pyroptosis. After chemotherapy, cleavage of GSDME by caspase-3 induced pyroptosis in certain GSDME-expressing cancer cells. GSDME was silenced in most cancer cells but expressed in many normal tissues. Human primary cells exhibited GSDME-dependent pyroptosis upon activation of caspase-3 by chemotherapy drugs. Gsdme(-/-) (also known as Dfna5(-/-)) mice were protected from chemotherapy-induced tissue damage and weight loss. These findings suggest that caspase-3 activation can trigger necrosis by cleaving GSDME and offer new insights into cancer chemotherapy.",1
7815433,Frequency of arylsulphatase A pseudodeficiency associated mutations in a healthy population,"Arylsulphatase A (ASA, EC 3.1.6.1) is a lysosomal enzyme that catalyses cerebroside sulphate degradation. ASA deficiency is associated with metachromatic leucodystrophy (MLD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder, which is characterised by the storage of cerebroside sulphate. Low ASA activities can be also observed in clinically healthy persons, a condition termed ASA pseudodeficiency. Two mutations responsible for the majority of pseudodeficiency alleles have been defined in the ASA gene. These are both A-->G transitions. One causes an asparagine to serine substitution (N350S). The second changes the first polyadenylation signal downstream of the stop codon (1524 + 95A-->G), which causes a severe deficiency of one ASA mRNA species. The incidence of the pseudodeficiency allele is estimated to be high in the general population and can be found in families carrying MLD associated mutations. We report a reliable stratagem for detecting the two PD associated mutations separately, which we have applied to a healthy population. Two homozygotes for the N350S and 1524 + 95A-->G mutations were detected, which gives a population frequency of 2.6%. The overall frequencies of the ASA-PD mutations were shown to be 17.5% for the N350S change and 13.0% for the 1524 + 95A-->G change, estimating each mutation separately. In addition, the frequency of both PD associated mutations occurring together on the same chromosome was found to be 12.3% in our population. The study has also allowed us to establish a new control ASA activity range, which was based on assay of blood from persons who had been shown at the DNA level not to carry ASA PD associated mutations.",1

15386022,Role of histone H2A ubiquitination in Polycomb silencing,"Covalent modification of histones is important in regulating chromatin dynamics and transcription. One example of such modification is ubiquitination, which mainly occurs on histones H2A and H2B. Although recent studies have uncovered the enzymes involved in histone H2B ubiquitination and a 'cross-talk' between H2B ubiquitination and histone methylation, the responsible enzymes and the functions of H2A ubiquitination are unknown. Here we report the purification and functional characterization of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is specific for histone H2A. The complex, termed hPRC1L (human Polycomb repressive complex 1-like), is composed of several Polycomb-group proteins including Ring1, Ring2, Bmi1 and HPH2. hPRC1L monoubiquitinates nucleosomal histone H2A at lysine 119. Reducing the expression of Ring2 results in a dramatic decrease in the level of ubiquitinated H2A in HeLa cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated colocalization of dRing with ubiquitinated H2A at the PRE and promoter regions of the Drosophila Ubx gene in wing imaginal discs. Removal of dRing in SL2 tissue culture cells by RNA interference resulted in loss of H2A ubiquitination concomitant with derepression of Ubx. Thus, our studies identify the H2A ubiquitin ligase, and link H2A ubiquitination to Polycomb silencing.",1
6989039,Human renal allograft rejection is predicted by serial determinations of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity,"The early recognition and prompt treatment of rejection may minimise damage to renal allografts. Preliminary studies showed whole blood effector cell function in a constant antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay system to be suppressed in recipients with stable renal function. To investigate the possible role of ADCC in the rejection process, serial estimates were performed in 29 consecutive recipients of cadaveric kidneys. The generation of ADCC, as measured in vitro, preceded the biochemical confirmation of an impending rejection episode by 3 to 5 days for 31 of 33 episodes experienced by 23 recipients. Statistical analysis (X2) demonstrated a highly significant correlation between ADCC generation as measured in vitro and subsequent episodes of graft rejection. In contrast, six recipients who did not experience rejection episodes during the first 3 months postgrafting showed no evidence of ADCC activity. Thus, ADCC may be used to identify rejection earlier than has previously been possible.",0
24492649,Correlated spin currents generated by resonant-crossed Andreev reflections in topological superconductors,"Topological superconductors, which support Majorana fermion excitations, have been the subject of intense studies due to their novel transport properties and their potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum computations. Here we propose a new type of topological superconductors that can be used as a novel source of correlated spin currents. We show that inducing superconductivity on a AIII class topological insulator wire, which respects a chiral symmetry and supports protected fermionic end states, will result in a topological superconductor. This topological superconductor supports two topological phases with one or two Majorana fermion end states, respectively. In the phase with two Majorana fermions, the superconductor can split Cooper pairs efficiently into electrons in two spatially separated leads due to Majorana-induced resonant-crossed Andreev reflections. The resulting currents in the leads are correlated and spin-polarized. Importantly, the proposed topological superconductors can be realized using quantum anomalous Hall insulators in proximity to superconductors. ",0

18492952,Extensive contacts between ADAMTS13 exosites and von Willebrand factor domain A2 contribute to substrate specificity,"The metalloprotease ADAMTS13 efficiently cleaves only the Tyr(1605)-Met(1606) bond in the central A2 domain of multimeric von Willebrand factor (VWF), even though VWF constitutes only 0.02% of plasma proteins. This remarkable specificity depends in part on binding of the noncatalytic ADAMTS13 spacer domain to the C-terminal alpha-helix of VWF domain A2. By kinetic analysis of recombinant ADAMTS13 constructs, we show that the first thrombospondin-1, Cys-rich, and spacer domains of ADAMTS13 interact with segments of VWF domain A2 between Gln(1624) and Arg(1668), and together these exosite interactions increase the rate of substrate cleavage by at least approximately 300-fold. Internal deletion of Gln(1624)-Arg(1641) minimally affected the rate of cleavage, indicating that ADAMTS13 does not require a specific distance between the scissile bond and auxiliary substrate binding sites. Smaller deletions of the P2-P9 or the P4'-P18' residues on either side of the Tyr(1605)-Met(1606) bond abolished cleavage, indicating that the metalloprotease domain interacts with additional residues flanking the cleavage site. Thus, specific recognition of VWF depends on cooperative, modular contacts between several ADAMTS13 domains and discrete segments of VWF domain A2.",1
20802426,The efficacy of treatment for systemic sclerosis interstitial lung disease: results from a meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: This meta-analysis examined all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmacotherapy for systemic sclerosis (SSc)-interstitial lung disease (ILD) with placebo or alternative drugs on pulmonary function tests (PFTs), quality of life, dyspnea, skin thickness, and adverse events. MATERIAL/METHODS: Forty studies were identified, and from these 2 RCTs examining cyclophosphamide and 1 examining bosentan met inclusion criteria (studies had to be randomized, have at least 20 SSc-ILD patients, and have PFTs as primary outcomes). RESULTS: Differences between groups for change of PFT scores between baseline and 12 months were not significant when the 3 trials were combined. The treatment effect of cyclophosphamide versus placebo on forced vital capacity revealed a mean difference of 3.30% (95% confidence interval, 0.06-6.54). Diffusing capacity and total lung capacity did not change. CONCLUSIONS: This conservative yet significant effect of cyclophosphamide demonstrates the need for further investigation of its effectiveness on patient-important outcomes such as dyspnea and quality of life, which could not be evaluated by this meta-analysis. It may be that studies in SSc-ILD need outcomes that are more sensitive to change.",0
21796607,Neurological disorders associated with gluten sensitivity,"Gluten sensitivity is a systemic autoimmune disease that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals on ingesting gluten. It can appear at any age, then becoming a permanent condition. It is more frequent in women, as happens with other autoimmune diseases. Celiac disease is the intestinal form and the most important manifestation among a set of gluten-induced autoimmune pathologies that affect different systems. Neurological manifestations of gluten sensitivity, with or without enteropathy, are also frequent, their pathogenesis including an immunological attack on the central and peripheral nervous tissue accompanied by neurodegenerative changes. The clinical manifestations are varied, but the most common syndromes are cerebellar ataxia and peripheral neuropathy. Finally, gluten sensitivity is associated to a varying degree, with other complex diseases and could influence their evolution. The early detection of cases of gluten sensitivity with neurological manifestations and subsequent treatment with the gluten-free diet could provide remarkable benefits to the patients.",0
9678705,Linkage disequilibrium between the M470V variant and the IVS8 polyT alleles of the CFTR gene in CBAVD,"Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) is a cause of male sterility mostly resulting from mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene. The most common defect is the 5T variant at the branch/acceptor site of intron 8, which induces high levels of exon 9 skipping leading to non-functional protein. However, this 5T variant has incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, suggesting that some other regulatory factors may modulate the splicing of exon 9. To identify such factors, we report here the genetic analysis of a polymorphic locus, M470V, located in exon 10 of the CFTR gene in 60 patients with CBAVD, compared to a normal control population. The statistical analysis showed strong linkage disequilibrium between the 5T allele and the V allele of the M470V polymorphism in the CBAVD population, but not in the normal population. The V allele in a gene carrying 5T could, however, contribute to lowering the level of normal transcripts, as already suggested by in vitro transcriptional studies. These genetic findings, together with previous studies, suggest involvement of the M470V variant in the modulation of the splicing of exon 9 of the CFTR gene.",1
32123433,Volatome finger printing of red wines made from grapes grown under tropical conditions of India using thermal-desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS),"The current study evaluated the key characters of aroma composition in diversified red wines (Cinsaut, Grenache, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Nielluccio, Tempranillo, Syrah, Merlot and Caladoc). Out of hundreds of volatile compounds 64 compounds were considered for study. Different groups consisting of fatty acids, volatile alcohols, aldehydes, esters, volatile phenols and terpenes were analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry coupled with thermal desorption (TD-GC-MS). Among all these diversified classes, alcohols were found as the most dominant group followed by esters and acids whereas aldehydes, phenols and terpenes were found to be minor compounds. Among the varieties, Nielluccio wine recorded highest concentration of total volatile compounds (191.53 mg/L) while, it was least in Caladoc wines (15.45 mg/L). The principal component analysis clearly differentiated Grenache wines based on their relationships between scores and their aroma composition followed by Nielluccio and Cinsuat wines. Out of sixty four compounds, only six aromatic compounds viz. butanediol, isoamyl actate, gamma-Terpene, butanol, acetic acid and furfural have satisfying aroma descriptors with floral and fruity nuances and contribute to differentiate the Grenache wines from other varieties which have similar scores in PC1 analysis. The cluster analysis also suggested that the wines in the same group (Cinsaut, Tempranillo and Syrah), (Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Caladoc and Merlot) and (Nielluccio and Petit Verdot) had similar aroma characterization. Grenache wines were well differentiated from the sub group formed by other red varieties.",0
31759787,Sex Differences in New York Heart Association Functional Classification and Survival in Acute Heart Failure Patients With Preserved or Reduced Ejection Fraction,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of sex on the relationship between the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification and survival in acute decompensated heart failure (HF) patients with preserved or reduced ejection fraction (EF). METHODS: Of 4842 patients enrolled in the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Syndromes (ATTEND) registry, 4717 (2730 men and 1987 women) were investigated to assess the association of sex, NYHA functional class, and preserved or reduced EF with all-cause death. Men and women were divided into 6 groups based on left ventricular EF (preserved or reduced) and NYHA functional class (II, III, or IV) at admission. RESULTS: Among both sexes with preserved EF, multivariable analysis confirmed that NYHA functional class IV was associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause death than NYHA functional class II. Similarly, in women with reduced EF, NYHA functional class IV was a significant predictor of all-cause death compared with class II. However, in men with reduced EF, the adjusted risk of all-cause death was similar for those in NYHA functional classes II, III, and IV. Furthermore, the interaction between sex and NYHA functional classes II to IV was statistically significant for all-cause death in reduced EF patients (P for interaction = 0.037), but not in preserved EF patients (P for interaction = 0.711). CONCLUSIONS: NYHA functional class IV was a significant predictor of all-cause death in both sexes with preserved EF, whereas NYHA functional class IV was a significant predictor of all-cause death in women, but not in men, with reduced EF.",0
26728636,A qualitative investigation of factors that matter to individuals in the pain management process,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a complex condition to manage with widespread consequences including physical disability, psychosocial effects and increased use of healthcare. Previous research has found patients' experiences within health care can be influenced by factors such as expectations, therapist characteristics and treatment process. This study used patient interviews to identify the key factors that influence individuals' experiences in the management of chronic pain. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews in either a home or hospital setting. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted on eight participants attending hospital-based pain management. Participants were asked about their experiences of pain management and living with a chronic pain condition. Interviews were transcribed and analysed thematically. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified; impact of their condition on daily life, clinical interactions and the pain management process. Understanding the condition was a key factor for the patients, in particular, explanation by the clinician. The temporality of their pain meant timing of appointments was critical. Patients reported factors such as family days and follow-up sessions would improve their treatment experience. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted important factors for healthcare professionals and patients in the management of chronic pain. Participants indicated a desire to understand their condition and learn strategies for self-management to allow them to cope better. As patients found benefit from being involved in the management process, discussions around the options for treatment may enhance management and rehabilitation. It is important we continue to research factors important to individuals with musculoskeletal pain to find an effective, evidence-based framework for understanding and managing this condition. Implications for rehabilitation This study highlights the importance to patients of being given information to help them understand their pain condition and to learn strategies for self-management to cope better. Where information was not provided and inadequate time allowed for questioning and discussion, patients tended to desire more frequent access to the care services. More effective communication may result in reduced demand and more efficient management. Patients suggested that ongoing peer support may offer an alternative to clinician-led services.",0
7350263,An evaluation system for residency training,"The authors distinguish between systematic and episodic methods of educational evaluation and review the numerous pressures necessitating incorporation of evaluation systems into house-staff training programs. Such pressures include needs to document quality and quantity of training experiences, often mandated by external agencies, as well as trainee desire for increased feedback to guide their personal development. In response, a house-staff evaluation model based on principles of participative decision making and collegial information sharing was developed and implemented at the University of North Carolina. The model features use of multiple and interacting sources of information about each resident and structured occasion for that information to be discussed in the resident's presence. This process leads to carefully documented decisions about strengths and weaknesses of each resident and about the program itself. Evaluation systems are beneficial to the degree that their design matches the organizational climate of the program they serve, and to the degree that they can evolve as the program evolves to maintain such goodness-of-fit.",0
9349501,Chimeric MLL products with a Ras binding cytoplasmic protein AF6 involved in t(6;11) (q27;q23) leukemia localize in the nucleus,"In infantile leukemias and therapy-related leukemias, the MLL gene is frequently found to be disrupted and fused to various translocation partner genes, such as AF4/FEL, LTG9/AF9 and LTG19/ENL as a result of 11q23 translocations. We previously showed that the N-terminal portion common to various chimeric MLL products, as well as to MLL-LTG9 and MLL-LTG19, localizes in the nuclei, and therefore suggested that it might play an important role in leukemogenesis. In the present study, MLL-AF6 chimeric products found in the t(6;11)(q27;q23) translocation were analysed since AF6, a Ras-binding protein, exhibits a different subcellular localization from that of LTG9/AF9 and LTG19/ENL. Immunofluorescence staining data and cell fractionation analyses demonstrated that MLL-AF6 chimeric products localize in the nuclei despite the fact that AF6 itself localizes in the cytoplasm, confirming the importance of the nuclear localization of chimeric MLL products. The region in the N-terminal portion of MLL responsible for this nuclear localization was examined and found to be a region containing AT-hook motifs.",1
15263867,Continuity of care: validation of a new self-report measure for individuals using mental health services,"Continuity of care is a concern for individuals with persistent mental illness who need diverse services over time in response to multiple and changing needs. Efforts to study continuity have been hampered by lack of appropriate instruments. The Alberta Continuity of Services Scale--Mental Health is a newly developed, self-report scale that assesses continuity of care across settings and providers. This study examined the structure, reliability, and validity of the measure among users of community mental health programs. Findings were positive. Scores captured both positive and negative perceptions of care. Factor analyses elucidated 3 components of continuity--system access, interpersonal aspects, and care team function. Associations between the continuity scores and selected client and service use measures supported its validity. The tool holds promise for system monitoring, but would need refinements to create a shorter, conceptually clearer version. Also, performance among individuals with mild and very severe levels of mental illness needs to be evaluated.",0
104965,Isolation and characterization of an endogenous inhibitor of protein synthesis in Escherichia coli K-12,"A low-molecular-weight factor was isolated from cell extracts of Escherichia coli K-12. The concentration of the factor in cells was dependent upon nutritional conditions, the concentration being higher in faster growing cells. Treatment of cells with colicin K caused an increase in concentration of the factor. The factor inhibited protein synthesis in E. coli. This inhibition was reversible, apparently because of metabolism of the factor. The inhibition of synthesis of beta-galactosidase lasted longer than the inhibition of protein synthesis; cyclic AMP eliminated this difference. The factor inhibited the synthesis of beta-galactosidase from preformed lac mRNA, indicating an inhibition of translation. Kinetic studies of the onset of inhibition of beta-galactosidase synthesis by the factor suggested that the factor may inhibit protein synthesis at the initiation of translation.",0
1702541,Increased gene expression of Alzheimer disease beta-amyloid precursor protein in senescent cultured fibroblasts,"The pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease is the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques in the brains of patients. Plaque cores contain a 4- to 5-kDa amyloid beta-protein fragment which is also found in the cerebral blood vessels of affected individuals. Since amyloid deposition in the brain increases with age even in normal people, we sought to establish whether the disease state bears a direct relationship with normal aging processes. As a model for biological aging, the process of cellular senescence in vitro was used. mRNA levels of beta-amyloid precursor protein associated with Alzheimer disease were compared in human fibroblasts in culture at early passage and when the same fibroblasts were grown to senescence after more than 52 population doublings. A dramatic increase in mRNA was observed in senescent IMR-90 fibroblasts compared with early-passage cells. Hybridization of mRNA from senescent and early proliferating fibroblasts with oligonucleotide probes specific for the three alternatively spliced transcripts of the gene gave similar results, indicating an increase during senescence of all three forms. A similar, though more modest, increase in message levels was also observed in early-passage fibroblasts made quiescent by serum deprivation; with repletion of serum, however, the expression returned to previous low levels. ELISAs were performed on cell extracts from senescent, early proliferating, and quiescent fibroblasts, and quiescent fibroblasts repleted with serum for over 48 hr, using polyclonal antibodies to a synthetic peptide of the beta-amyloid precursor. The results confirmed that the differences in mRNA expression were partially reflected at the protein level. Regulated expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein may be an important determinant of growth and metabolic responses to serum and growth factors under physiological as well as pathological conditions.",1
8773270,Incidental intracranial vascular pathology in patients investigated for carotid stenosis,"The assessment of cervical and cranial carotid arteries for atherosclerotic disease is the second commonest referral for angiography in our neuroradiological department; in 1993 this accounted for approximately 17% of the total cases. This is due to the resurgence of interest in endarterectomy for severe carotid stenosis. Although the degree of stenosis can usually be assessed adequately by duplex Doppler ultrasonography, angiography is still recommended as a preoperative examination. The intracranial vessels are visualised, which we consider important when planning vascular surgery. We present a prospective study of 100 patients referred for angiographic assessment of carotid stenosis. As well as giving information about the carotid bifurcation, angiography showed 9 patients to have aneurysms, 2 arteriovenous malformations and 15 severe intracranial atherosclerosis. We consider these ",0
10522889,APOE genotype as a risk factor for ischemic cerebrovascular disease: a meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a specific apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism is a risk factor for ischemic cerebrovascular disease (CVD; stroke or TIA). BACKGROUND: The APOE epsilon4 allele is overrepresented in AD, atherosclerosis, and ischemic heart disease. In addition, epsilon4 carriers have higher plasma cholesterol levels than non-epsilon4 carriers. METHODS: Using Medline (OVID and PubMed), a search was performed for all studies that examined APOE in ischemic CVD. The authors identified nine case-control studies that were suitable for analysis. RESULTS: There were 926 patients with ischemic stroke or TIAs and 890 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Overall analysis revealed a significantly higher APOE-epsilon4 allelic frequency in affected patients compared with control subjects (0.14 versus 0.09; odds ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.36 to 2.09; p<0.001). There was a significant excess of the epsilon3 allele (0.85 versus 0.80) but not the epsilon2 allele (0.06 versus 0.06) in the control subjects compared with the ischemic CVD patients. Seven studies had data on APOE genotypes. Carriers of epsilon4 were more frequent among ischemic CVD patients than control subjects (27% versus 18%; odds ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.34 to 2.23; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The APOE-epsilon4 allele and carriers of epsilon4 are more frequent among patients with ischemic CVD compared with control subjects. The epsilon2 allele does not appear to be protective for ischemic CVD. These findings imply a role for the APOE genotype in the pathogenesis of some cases of ischemic CVD.",1
2363422,"Possible heterogeneity in spondyloenchondrodysplasia: quadriparesis, basal ganglia calcifications, and chondrocyte inclusions","We report on 6 patients with short stature and progressive enchondromatous-like changes of the vertebral bodies and the metaphyses of the long bones. Parental consanguinity was observed in 5 of 6 cases, supporting autosomal recessive inheritance. In spite of the similarity in radiographic changes and body proportions, genetic heterogeneity is suggested by the presence of CNS calcifications in 3 patients. Two of the latter had progressive quadriparesis. We tentatively classified these patients into 2 provisional types. An iliac crest biopsy in one of the patients with ",1
11102975,First missense mutations (R388W and R425H) of AMPD1 accompanied with myopathy found in a Japanese patient,"Skeletal muscle AMP deaminase (AMPD: E.C. 3.5.4.6) deficiency is one of the most common inherited defects in the Caucasians, but not in Asians. Although a diagnosis of AMPD1 deficiency is indeed based on the reduced enzymatic activity, its clinical significance is still rather controversial since most subjects are asymptomatic. Alternative splicing of exon 2 in individuals who have inherited this defect is thought to provide a mechanism for phenotypic rescue that may explain the variability of clinical symptoms as we reported earlier. In this report we present the first case with a detectable defect of the AMPD1 gene in a Japanese patient with myopathy. Two missense mutations (R388W and R425H) in exon 9 and exon 10 of the AMPD1 gene were found. Prokaryotic expression showed a comparable amount of the AMPD1 peptides and undetectable AMPD activity in the constructs with these mutations. From this study, we have concluded that this patient is a compound heterozygote for AMPD1 mutant allele. This study also demonstrates the first reported instance of detectable dysfunction of the AMPD1 gene product, suggesting that AMPD1 indeed has a key role in muscle metabolism and function.",1
30903348,Detection and characterization of an albumin-like protein in Leishmania donovani,"The protozoan parasite, Leishmania donovani, undergoes several molecular adaptations and secretes many effector molecules for host cell manipulation and successful parasitism. The current study identifies an albumin-like secretory protein, expressed in its extracellular promastigote forms. A leishmanial complementary DNA sequence of a partial gene has been cloned, and the encoded peptide (14 kD) is used for the production of polyclonal antibody. This targeted antibody identifies a large native protein (66.421 kD), expressed stage-specifically in promastigotes. Through electron microscopic studies, the native protein is found to be localized in the flagellar pocket and flagella and at the surface of the promastigotes. This native protein is purified with the same customized antibody for future characterization and sequencing. The sequence analysis reveals its homology with the mammalian serum albumin. It is evidenced from in silico studies that this albumin-like protein remains associated with long-chain fatty acids while in vitro studies indicate its close association with membrane cholesterol. Since antibody-mediated blocking compromises the parasite infectivity, these leishmanial albumin-like molecules are hereby proposed to play an instrumental role in the infectivity of L. donovani to peripheral blood monocyte cells. Thus, identification and characterization of an albumin-like protein in L. donovani promastigotes may be interpreted as a molecular adaptation candidate. It may be hypothesized that the parasite mimics the mammalian system for importing fatty acids into the intracellular amastigotes, facilitating its host cell infectivity.",0
10864197,Dose-dense epirubicin and paclitaxel with G-CSF: a study of decreasing intervals in metastatic breast cancer,"Anthracyclines and taxanes are very effective drugs in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. With G-CSF support, the dose-intensity of this combination can be increased by reducing the interval between chemotherapy cycles, the so-called 'shortening of cycle time'. We treated 36 patients with advanced breast cancer in a multicentre phase I/II study. The treatment regimen consisted of epirubicin 75 mg m(-2) followed by paclitaxel 135 mg m(-2) (3 h) in combination with G-CSF. At least six patients were treated in each cohort and were evaluated over the first three cycles. Starting at an interval of 14 days, in subsequent cohorts of patients the interval could be shortened to 10 days. An 8-day interval was not feasible due mainly to incomplete neutrophil recovery at the day of the next scheduled cycle. In the 10-day interval cohort it was feasible to increase the paclitaxel dose to 175 mg m(-2). The haematological and non-haematological toxicity was relatively mild. No cumulative myelosuppression was observed over at least three consecutive cycles. In combination with G-CSF, epirubicin 75 mg m(-2) and paclitaxel 175 mg m(-2) could be safely administered every 10 days over at least three cycles, enabling a dose intensity of 52 and 122 mg m(-2) per week, respectively.",0
7466127,Prolonged increases in paradoxical sleep during and after avoidance-task acquisition,"Rats were trained in a two-way shock-avoidance task, either in a single training session of 100 trials or over a 5 day period with 20 trials per day. Electroencephalograph and electromyograph recordings were continuous for 2 days prior (base line), during, and following the experiments, except during the actual training sessions. Animals that learned the task showed marked increases in PS. Rats that learned the distributed trials training task showed PS increases in the 24 hr period prior to a maximum increase in correct performance. These PS elevations appeared after a 10 hr latency following the training session. The animals that learned the single training session exhibited PS increases that persisted for a period of 6 days, which appeared daily in a cyclic manner. The latency to onset of these PS changes was less than 1 hr. The PS increases in both types of training were due to an increase in the number of PS periods and are believed to be different manifestations of the same flexible mechanism. This mechanism is considered to be involved with some aspect of learning other than the acquisition process, such as retention.",0
12565841,There exist at least 30 human G-protein-coupled receptors with long Ser/Thr-rich N-termini,"We report six novel members of the superfamily of human G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) found by searches in the human genome databases, termed GPR123, GPR124, GPR125, GPR126, GPR127, and GPR128. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that these are additional members of the family of GPCRs with long N-termini, previously termed EGF-7TM, LNB-7TM, B2 or LN-7TM, showing that there exist at least 30 such GPCRs in the human genome. Three of these receptors form their own phylogenetic cluster, while two other places in a cluster with the previously reported HE6 and GPR56 (TM7XN1) and one with EMR1-3. All the novel receptors have a GPS domain in their N-terminus, except GPR123, as well as long Ser/Thr rich regions forming mucin-like stalks. GPR124 and GPR125 have a leucine rich repeat (LRR), an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, and a hormone-binding domain (HBD). The Ig domain shows similarities to motilin and titin, while the LRR domain shows similarities to LRIG1 and SLIT1-2. GPR127 has one EGF domain while GPR126 and GPR128 do not contain domains that are readily recognized in other proteins beyond the GPS domain. We found several human EST sequences for most of the receptors showing differential expression patterns, which may indicate that some of these receptors participate in central functions while others are more likely to have a role in the immune or reproductive systems.",1
10734115,The Bloom's syndrome gene product interacts with topoisomerase III,"Bloom's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder associated with loss of genomic integrity and a large increase in the incidence of many types of cancer at an early age. The Bloom's syndrome gene product, BLM, belongs to the RecQ family of DNA helicases, which also includes the human Werner's and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome gene products and the Sgs1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This family shows strong evolutionary conservation of protein structure and function. Previous studies have shown that Sgs1p interacts both physically and genetically with topoisomerase III. Here, we have investigated whether this interaction has been conserved in human cells. We show that BLM and hTOPO IIIalpha, one of two human topoisomerase III homologues, co-localize in the nucleus of human cells and can be co-immunoprecipitated from human cell extracts. Moreover, the purified BLM and hTOPO IIIalpha proteins are able to bind specifically to each other in vitro, indicating that the interaction is direct. We have mapped two independent domains on BLM that are important for mediating the interaction with hTOPO IIIalpha. Furthermore, through characterizing a genetic interaction between BLM and TOP3 in S. cerevisiae, we have identified a functional role for the hTOPO IIIalpha interaction domains in BLM.",1
32723328,NF-kappaB p65-dependent transcriptional regulation of histone deacetylase 2 contributes to the chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain via the microRNA-183/TXNIP/NLRP3 axis,"BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain is related to the sustained activation of neuroglial cells and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the spinal dorsal horn. However, the clinical efficacy of currently available treatments is very limited. The transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is a ubiquitously expressed protein family and considered to be crucial in autoimmunity. Thus, our study aimed to examine the influence of NF-kappaB p65 in chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain as well as its underlying mechanism. METHODS: A rat model of neuropathic pain was established by CCI induction followed by isolation of microglial cells. The binding of NF-kappaB p65 to HDAC2, of miR-183 to TXNIP, and of TXNIP to NLRP3 was investigated. Expression of miR-183, NF-kappaB p65, HDAC2, TXNIP, and NLRP3 was determined with their functions in CCI rats and microglial cells analyzed by gain- and loss-of-function experiments. RESULTS: NF-kappaB p65 and HDAC2 were upregulated while miR-183 was downregulated in the dorsal horn of the CCI rat spinal cord. NF-kappaB p65 was bound to the HDAC2 promoter and then increased its expression. HDAC2 reduced miR-183 expression by deacetylation of histone H4. Additionally, miR-183 negatively regulated TXNIP. Mechanistically, NF-kappaB p65 downregulated the miR-183 expression via the upregulation of HDAC2 and further induced inflammatory response by activating the TXNIP-NLRP3 inflammasome axis, thus aggravating the neuropathic pain in CCI rats and microglial cells. CONCLUSION: These results revealed a novel transcriptional mechanism of interplay between NF-kappaB and HDAC2 focusing on neuropathic pain via the miR-183/TXNIP/NLRP3 axis.",0
10574461,Characterization of cDNA clones selected by the GeneMark analysis from size-fractionated cDNA libraries from human brain,"We have conducted a sequencing project of human cDNAs which encode large proteins in brain. For selection of cDNA clones to be sequenced in this project, cDNA clones have been experimentally examined by in vitro transcription/translation prior to sequencing. In this study, we tested an alternative approach for picking up cDNA clones having a high probability of carrying protein coding region. This approach exploited 5'-end single-pass sequence data and the GeneMark program for assessing protein-coding potential, and allowed us to select 74 clones out of 14,804 redundant cDNA clones. The complete sequence data of these 74 clones revealed that 45% of them encoded proteins consisting of more than 500 amino acid residues while all the clones thus selected carried possible protein coding sequences as expected. The results indicated that the GeneMark analysis of 5'-end sequences of cDNAs offered us a simple and effective means to select cDNA clones with protein-coding potential although the sizes of the encoded proteins could not be predicted.",1

26855419,"Tousled kinase activator, gallic acid, promotes homologous recombinational repair and suppresses radiation cytotoxicity in salivary gland cells","Accidental or medical radiation exposure of the salivary glands can gravely impact oral health. Previous studies have shown the importance of Tousled-like kinase 1 (TLK1) and its alternate start variant TLK1B in cell survival against genotoxic stresses. Through a high-throughput library screening of natural compounds, the phenolic phytochemical, gallic acid (GA), was identified as a modulator of TLK1/1B. This small molecule possesses anti-oxidant and free radical scavenging properties, but in this study, we report that in vitro it promotes survival of human salivary acinar cells, NS-SV-AC, through repair of ionizing radiation damage. Irradiated cells treated with GA show improved clonogenic survival compared to untreated controls. And, analyses of DNA repair kinetics by alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis and gamma-H2AX foci immunofluorescence indicate rapid resolution of DNA breaks in drug-treated cells. Study of DR-GFP transgene repair indicates GA facilitates homologous recombinational repair to establish a functional GFP gene. In contrast, inactivation of TLK1 or its shRNA knockdown suppressed resolution of radiation-induced DNA tails in NS-SV-AC, and homology directed repair in DR-GFP cells. Consistent with our results in culture, animals treated with GA after exposure to fractionated radiation showed better preservation of salivary function compared to saline-treated animals. Our results suggest that GA-mediated transient modulation of TLK1 activity promotes DNA repair and suppresses radiation cytoxicity in salivary gland cells. ",0
10806703,Apoptosis of human oocytes is age-related,"OBJECTIVE: To study the morphological characteristics, and rate of apoptosis of human oocytes in relation to age. METHODS: 206 oocytes were aspirated from antral follicles 4-6 mm in diameter from 58 patients who had surgery done for ovarian cysts. These oocytes were incubated in Ham's F10 with 10% fetal cord serum (FCS) for 48-120 hours, and examined under inverted microscope every 6-8 hours to see their morphological changes. In situ end-labeling (ISEL) of fragmented DNA was used to confirm apoptosis. RESULTS: The characteristics of apoptosis are: (1) shape change of oocytes. (2) oocyte shrinkage. (3) chromatic condensation and apoptotic body formation. (4) internucleosomal DNA cleavage was shown by ISEL. Apoptosis occurred in 13.9% (women aged 21-30), 37.7% (women aged 31-40), and 61.5% (women aged 41-50) respectively. The rate of apoptosis was much higher in women aged 41-50 than that in the other two groups. CONCLUSION: The rate of apoptosis of human immature oocytes cultured in vitro is much higher in older women aged 41-50 than in those aged 21-40, which may account for the poor response to superovulation stimulation and low oocyte quality in older women.",0
15972296,Genomic structure and functional characterization of the human ADAM10 promoter,"The ADAM10 gene encodes a membrane-bound disintegrin-metalloproteinase, which, after overexpression in an Alzheimer disease (AD) mouse model, prevents amyloid pathology and improves long-term potentiation and memory. Because enhancing ADAM10 expression appears to be a reasonable approach for treatment of AD, we functionally analyzed the ADAM10 gene. Both human and mouse ADAM10 genes comprise approximately 160 kbp, are composed of 16 exons, and are evolutionarily highly conserved within 500 bp upstream of either translation initiation site. By using luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrate that nucleotides -2179 to -1 upstream of the human ADAM10 translation initiation site represent a functional TATA-less promoter. Within this region we identified and examined several single nucleotide polymorphisms, but did not detect significant differences in their appearance between AD and nondemented control subjects. By deletion analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, transcription factor overexpression and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we identified nucleotides -508 to -300 as the core promoter and found Sp1, USF, and retinoic acid-responsive elements to modulate its activity. Finally, we identified vitamin A acid (RA) as an inducer of human ADAM10 promoter activity. This finding suggests that pharmacologic targeting of RA receptors may increase the expression of the alpha-secretase ADAM10 with beneficial effects on AD pathology.",1

21623381,Misregulated alternative splicing of BIN1 is associated with T tubule alterations and muscle weakness in myotonic dystrophy,"Myotonic dystrophy is the most common muscular dystrophy in adults and the first recognized example of an RNA-mediated disease. Congenital myotonic dystrophy (CDM1) and myotonic dystrophy of type 1 (DM1) or of type 2 (DM2) are caused by the expression of mutant RNAs containing expanded CUG or CCUG repeats, respectively. These mutant RNAs sequester the splicing regulator Muscleblind-like-1 (MBNL1), resulting in specific misregulation of the alternative splicing of other pre-mRNAs. We found that alternative splicing of the bridging integrator-1 (BIN1) pre-mRNA is altered in skeletal muscle samples of people with CDM1, DM1 and DM2. BIN1 is involved in tubular invaginations of membranes and is required for the biogenesis of muscle T tubules, which are specialized skeletal muscle membrane structures essential for excitation-contraction coupling. Mutations in the BIN1 gene cause centronuclear myopathy, which shares some histopathological features with myotonic dystrophy. We found that MBNL1 binds the BIN1 pre-mRNA and regulates its alternative splicing. BIN1 missplicing results in expression of an inactive form of BIN1 lacking phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate-binding and membrane-tubulating activities. Consistent with a defect of BIN1, muscle T tubules are altered in people with myotonic dystrophy, and membrane structures are restored upon expression of the normal splicing form of BIN1 in muscle cells of such individuals. Finally, reproducing BIN1 splicing alteration in mice is sufficient to promote T tubule alterations and muscle weakness, a predominant feature of myotonic dystrophy.",1
10807385,Clinicopathologic features of BRCA-linked and sporadic ovarian cancer,"CONTEXT: Most hereditary ovarian cancers are associated with germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Attempts to define the clinical significance of BRCA mutation status in ovarian cancer have produced conflicting results, especially regarding survival. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hereditary ovarian cancers have distinct clinical and pathological features compared with sporadic (nonhereditary) ovarian cancers. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cohort study of a consecutive series of 933 ovarian cancers diagnosed and treated at our institution, which is a comprehensive cancer center as designated by the National Cancer Institute, over a 12-year period (December 1986 to August 1998). PATIENTS: The study was restricted to patients of Jewish origin because of the ease of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotyping in this ethnic group. From the 189 patients who identified themselves as Jewish, 88 hereditary cases were identified with the presence of a germline founder mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. The remaining 101 cases from the same series not associated with a BRCA mutation and 2 additional groups (Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols 52 and 111) with ovarian cancer from clinical trials (for the survival analysis) were included for comparison. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age at diagnosis, surgical stage, histologic cell type and grade, and surgical outcome; and response to chemotherapy and survival for advanced-stage (II and IV) cases. RESULTS: Hereditary cancers were rarely diagnosed before age 40 years and were common after age 60 years, with mean age at diagnosis being significantly younger for BRCA1- vs BRCA2-linked patients (54 vs 62 years; P=.04). Histology, grade, stage, and success of cytoreductive surgery were similar for hereditary and sporadic cases. The hereditary group had a longer disease-free interval following primary chemotherapy in comparison with the nonhereditary group, with a median time to recurrence of 14 months and 7 months, respectively (P<.001). Those with hereditary cancers had improved survival compared with the nonhereditary group (P=.004). For stage III cancers, BRCA mutation status was an independent prognostic variable (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Although BRCA-associated hereditary ovarian cancers in this population have surgical and pathological characteristics similar to those of sporadic cancers, advanced-stage hereditary cancer patients survive longer than nonhereditary cancer patients. Age penetrance is greater for BRCA1-linked than for BRCA2-linked cancers in this population.",1
19203697,Complications of surgery for diseases of the guttural pouch,"Guttural pouch diseases pose serious challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Complications from treatment are common and often life-threatening, largely because the unique anatomy of the guttural pouches brings them into intimate contact with the nervous, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. There is little forgiveness for surgical errors, and so the surgeon should focus on ways to anticipate and prevent them. As with any disease, errors in diagnosis can set the stage for many surgical errors and must be recognized. This article deals with errors that can be expected after the most common surgical treatments for guttural pouch diseases.",0

29125598,A miR-20a/MAPK1/c-Myc regulatory feedback loop regulates breast carcinogenesis and chemoresistance,"Chemoresistance often leads to the failure of breast cancer treatment. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the progression and chemoresistance of cancer. However, because of the complexity of the mechanisms of chemoresistance and the specificity of miRNA regulation in different cell types, the function of miR-20a in breast cancer chemoresistance is still unclear. Here, by using miRNA microarray and high-content screening techniques, we found that miR-20a/b were significantly downregulated in breast cancer tissues compared with normal breast tissues, and low miR-20a/b expression was correlated with poor survival in breast cancer patients. Ectopic overexpression of miR-20a sensitized breast cancer cells to a broad spectrum of chemotherapy drugs and suppress their proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Further study demonstrated that miR-20a directly targeted the 3'untranslated region of MAPK1, and thus downregulated the expression of P-gp and c-Myc by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, whereas c-Myc can bind to the promoter region of the miR-20a gene to promote the expression of miR-20a. Together, our study identified a novel miR-20a/MAPK1/c-Myc feedback loop that regulates breast cancer growth and chemoresistance. These findings suggest that miR-20a synergizing with anticancer drugs will be a promising treatment strategy, especially for chemoresistant patients.",0
21072532,Familial frontotemporal dementia with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and a shared haplotype on chromosome 9p,"Families with autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD/ALS) have previously been linked to a locus on chromosome 9p21. We describe the clinical phenotype and pathology of a large family with autosomal dominant FTD/ALS with nine affected members originating from Gwent in South Wales, UK. We also further refine the locus on chromosome 9p21 using a haplotype sharing approach and assess heterogeneity in 9p21 linked families. Within this family, affected individuals present with either FTD or ALS or both diseases simultaneously. In addition there was marked phenotypic variation including ataxia, Parkinsonism, psychosis and visuo-spatial cognitive deficits. The pathological features of the three cases described were consistent with type 2 FTD pathology, as previously reported in similar families. However, we also report distinctive cerebellar and glial pathology and a significant proportion of TDP-43 negative inclusions. No mutations in known genes for FTD or ALS were found. We identified a large 4.8-megabase haplotype on chromosome 9p21, which was shared by all affected family members. This haplotype overlaps and limits the previously reported FTD/ALS linkage region on chromosome 9p21. Sequencing of this region did not identify any evidence of a pathogenic exonic mutation. This suggests that the pathogenic change affects non-coding DNA and that the disease is caused by variation in gene or protein expression.",1
22678948,Visible-light photocatalytic activity and deactivation mechanism of Ag3PO4 spherical particles,"Ag(3)PO(4) spherical particles were synthesized by a facile precipitation method using silver nitrate and Na(2) HPO(4) as precursors. The as-prepared samples had a high photocatalytic activity toward Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under visible-light illumination. With increasing recycling times the photocatalytic activity first increased and then decreased. Based on systematic characterization of particles by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a possible mechanism responsible for the improvement and subsequent decline of the photocatalytic performance of Ag(3)PO(4) is proposed. Ag(3)PO(4) spherical particles recycled for four times showed the highest photocatalytic activity because, according to our mechanism, Ag nanoparticles deposited on Ag(3)PO(4) acted as electron trapping centers to prevent photogenerated electron-hole pairs from recombination. A further increase in the recycle times decreases the photocatalytic activity owing to the shielding effect by Ag layers on the surface of Ag(3)PO(4). The results presented herein shed new light on the photostability of Ag(3) PO(4) spherical particles and are potentially applicable to other photocatalytically active composites.",0

18274757,Semi-automated volumetric analysis of lymph node metastases in patients with malignant melanoma stage III/IV--a feasibility study,"Therapy monitoring in oncological patient care requires accurate and reliable imaging and post-processing methods. RECIST criteria are the current standard, with inherent disadvantages. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of semi-automated volumetric analysis of lymph node metastases in patients with malignant melanoma compared to manual volumetric analysis and RECIST. Multislice CT was performed in 47 patients, covering the chest, abdomen and pelvis. In total, 227 suspicious, enlarged lymph nodes were evaluated retrospectively by two radiologists regarding diameters (RECIST), manually measured volume by placement of ROIs and semi-automated volumetric analysis. Volume (ml), quality of segmentation (++/--) and time effort (s) were evaluated in the study. The semi-automated volumetric analysis software tool was rated acceptable to excellent in 81% of all cases (reader 1) and 79% (reader 2). Median time for the entire segmentation process and necessary corrections was shorter with the semi-automated software than by manual segmentation. Bland-Altman plots showed a significantly lower interobserver variability for semi-automated volumetric than for RECIST measurements. The study demonstrated feasibility of volumetric analysis of lymph node metastases. The software allows a fast and robust segmentation in up to 80% of all cases. Ease of use and time needed are acceptable for application in the clinical routine. Variability and interuser bias were reduced to about one third of the values found for RECIST measurements.",0
12235360,Familial hemiplegic migraine mutations increase Ca(2+) influx through single human CaV2.1 channels and decrease maximal CaV2.1 current density in neurons,"Insights into the pathogenesis of migraine with aura may be gained from a study of human Ca(V)2.1 channels containing mutations linked to familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM). Here, we extend the previous single-channel analysis to human Ca(V)2.1 channels containing mutation V1457L. This mutation increased the channel open probability by shifting its activation to more negative voltages and reduced both the unitary conductance and the density of functional channels in the membrane. To investigate the possibility of changes in Ca(V)2.1 function common to all FHM mutations, we calculated the product of single-channel current and open probability as a measure of Ca(2+) influx through single Ca(V)2.1 channels. All five FHM mutants analyzed showed a single-channel Ca(2+) influx larger than wild type in a broad voltage range around the threshold of activation. We also expressed the FHM mutants in cerebellar granule cells from Ca(V)2.1alpha(1)-/- mice rather than HEK293 cells. The FHM mutations invariably led to a decrease of the maximal Ca(V)2.1 current density in neurons. Current densities were similar to wild type at lower voltages because of the negatively shifted activation of FHM mutants. Our data show that mutational changes of functional channel densities can be different in different cell types, and they uncover two functional effects common to all FHM mutations analyzed: increase of single-channel Ca(2+) influx and decrease of maximal Ca(V)2.1 current density in neurons. We discuss the relevance of these findings for the pathogenesis of migraine with aura.",1
20536506,Improving glycaemic control in children and adolescents: which aspects of therapy really matter?,"In paediatric diabetes, the concept of intensive therapy in the post-Diabetes Control and Complications Trial period has become subverted by a pharmaco-technological paradigm at the expense of other aspects of care such as goal-setting and psychosocial support. This review examines which patients benefit most from intensive therapy in terms of glycaemic control (HbA1c). It also reviews published controlled trial and observational data relating to the impact of various insulin types and delivery systems on glycaemic control and canvasses the literature dealing with the impact of patient support, philosophy of care, goal setting and treating team dynamic on HbA1c. Taking into account the characteristics of those patients who benefit most from intensive therapy, the quantum of HbA1c change and the persistence of changes that have been reported in selected and non-selected patient groups, it appears that there is a clear hierarchy in aspects of therapy that improve glycaemic control for children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes. Prime issues appear to be patient support, team cohesion and goal setting. The reported glycaemic benefits achieved by an isolated emphasis upon a pharmaco-technological paradigm are limited in children and adolescents. It appears that only after the prime issues have been first considered will the potential benefits of the insulin types and regimens then be realized.",0
1977766,Comparison of genomic DNAs of different enterococcal isolates using restriction endonucleases with infrequent recognition sites,"Epidemiologic evaluation of enterococci has been limited by the lack of a simple and effective method for comparing strains. In this study, we have compared chromosomal restriction endonuclease digestion patterns of 27 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis from three different locations by using pulsed-field electrophoresis of large chromosomal fragments (14 to 1,000 kilobases). All but two isolates generated a clear, evaluable pattern with a single lysis and digestion, and the remaining two were visualized when a larger quantity of bacteria was used. All isolates from different locations generated different restriction patterns, as did most isolates within a single location; there was also evidence of spread of strains between individuals in each location. The ease with which this analysis can be performed, together with the clarity and polymorphism seen in the patterns, suggests that this technique will be very useful for epidemiological evaluations of nosocomial enterococcal infections.",0

Of the 15 mammalian calpains, CAPN8 and CAPN9 are two that are expressed predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract, where they interact to form a protease complex, termed G-calpain. However, because native G-calpain exhibits a highly restricted expression pattern, it has never been purified, and the interactions between CAPN8 and CAPN9 have not been characterized. Here, we clarified the molecular nature of G-calpain by using recombinant proteins and transgenic mice expressing FLAG-tagged CAPN8 (CAPN8-FLAG). Recombinant mouse CAPN8 and CAPN9 co-expressed in eukaryotic expression systems exhibited the same mobility as native mouse G-calpain in Blue Native-PAGE gels, and CAPN8-FLAG immunoprecipitation from stomach homogenates of the transgenic mice showed that CAPN9 was the only protein that associated with CAPN8-FLAG. These results indicated that G-calpain is a heterodimer of CAPN8 and CAPN9. In addition, active recombinant G-calpain was expressed and purified using an in vitro translation system, and the purified protease exhibited enzymatic properties that were comparable with that of calpain-2. We found that an active-site mutant of CAPN8, but not CAPN9, compromised G-calpain's substrate cleavage activity, and that the N-terminal helix region of CAPN8 and the C-terminal EF-hands of CAPN8 and CAPN9 were involved in CAPN8/9 dimerization. Furthermore, CAPN8 protein in Capn9(-/-) mice was almost completely lost, whereas CAPN9 was only partially lost in Capn8(-/-) mice. Collectively, these results demonstrated that CAPN8 and CAPN9 function as catalytic and chaperone-like subunits, respectively, in G-calpain.",1
10353782,X linked mental retardation and infantile spasms in a family: new clinical data and linkage to Xp11.4-Xp22.11,"In order to describe the neurological abnormalities and to identify the gene localisation, we re-evaluated a previously reported family with X linked mental retardation (XLMR). Reliable data were obtained for six of the seven affected males, of whom two had had infantile spasms. Profound MR (IQ<20) was found in one and mild MR (IQ 50-70) in five males. No dysmorphic features, except for macrocephaly in one male, were found. Neurological abnormalities included varying degrees of spinocerebellar involvement. Neuroimaging studies showed abnormalities, such as cerebellar atrophy or corpus callosum hypoplasia or both, in three of the six males. Several affected and unaffected subjects suffered from hyperhidrosis, which appeared to segregate independently as an autosomal dominant trait. Genetic linkage analysis localised the XLMR disease gene to Xp11.4-Xp22.11 with a maximum multipoint lod score of 3.57, overlapping the candidate region recently found in two Belgian XLMR-infantile spasm families. Compared to the Belgian patients, the majority of the affected males in this report had a considerably milder phenotype.",1

11334825,Concealed arrhythmogenic syndromes: the hidden substrate of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation?,In approximately 6--10% of survivors of cardiac arrest no cardiac abnormality can be identified despite extensive clinical evaluation. Autopsy data confirm that in a similar percentage of victims of sudden death no structural heart disease can be identified at post mortem evaluation. Occurrence of cardiac arrest in the absence of a substrate is defined 'idiopathic ventricular fibrillation' thus admitting that the cause for the arrhythmic event has remained unknown. We present data supporting the hypothesis that incompletely penetrant genetic defects may underlie at least some of these unexplained deaths.,1
33053256,A Robust and Low-Power Bismuth Doped Tin Oxide Memristor Derived from Coaxial Conductive Filaments,"Memristor, processing data storage and logic operation all-in-one, is an advanced configuration for next generation computer. In this work, a bismuth doped tin oxide (Bi:SnO2 ) memristor with ITO/Bi:SnO2 /TiN structure has been fabricated. Observing from transmission electron microscope (TEM) for the Bi:SnO2 device, it is found that the bismuth atoms surround the surface of SnO2 crystals to form the coaxial Bi conductive filament. The self-compliance current, switching voltage and operating current of Bi:SnO2 memristor are remarkably smaller than that of ITO/SnO2 /TiN device. With the content of 4.8% Bi doping, the SET operating power of doped device is 16 microW for ITO/Bi:SnO2 /TiN memory cell of 0.4 x 0.4 microm(2) , which is cut down by two orders of magnitude. Hence, the findings in this study suggest that Bi:SnO2 memristors hold significant potential for application in low power memory and broadening the understanding of existing resistive switching (RS) mechanism.",0
27858723,Safety and improvement of movement function after stroke with atomoxetine: A pilot randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: Intensive, task-oriented motor training has been associated with neuroplastic reorganization and improved upper extremity movement function after stroke. However, to optimize such training for people with moderate-to-severe movement impairment, pharmacological modulation of neuroplasticity may be needed as an adjuvant intervention. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate safety, as well as improvement in movement function, associated with motor training paired with a drug to upregulate neuroplasticity after stroke. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 12 subjects with chronic stroke received either atomoxetine or placebo paired with motor training. Safety was assessed using vital signs. Upper extremity movement function was assessed using Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Wolf Motor Function Test, and Action Research Arm Test at baseline, post-intervention, and 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: No significant between-groups differences were found in mean heart rate (95% CI, -12.4-22.6; p = 0.23), mean systolic blood pressure (95% CI, -1.7-29.6; p = 0.21), or mean diastolic blood pressure (95% CI, -10.4-13.3; p = 0.08). A statistically significant between-groups difference on Fugl-Meyer at post-intervention favored the atomoxetine group (95% CI, 1.6-12.7; p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Atomoxetine combined with motor training appears safe and may optimize motor training outcomes after stroke.",0
24626881,IL-33 attenuates cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction via inhibition of the p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways,"The inflammatory response has adverse effects on left ventricular (LV) function and remodeling post-myocardial infarction (MI). Interleukin (IL)-33 is considered to have anti-inflammatory properties. The present study examined whether the suppression of inflammation with IL-33 was able to attenuate LV dysfunction and remodeling post-MI. The MI model was induced and the mice were treated with either saline or recombinant IL-33. Inflammatory mediators, LV functional changes and structural remodeling were evaluated. IL-33 significantly suppressed macrophage infiltration and the production of inflammatory cytokines in the myocardium. IL-33 treatment significantly improved LV function, reduced infarct size and infarct wall thinning. MI-induced activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathways was also suppressed. Our data demonstrated that IL-33 suppresses inflammatory responses and improved LV function and remodeling by inhibiting the p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways. IL-33 may be a potential therapeutic target for heart dysfunction post-MI. ",0
18387594,"CC2D2A, encoding a coiled-coil and C2 domain protein, causes autosomal-recessive mental retardation with retinitis pigmentosa","Autosomal-recessive inheritance is believed to be relatively common in mental retardation (MR), although only four genes for nonsyndromic autosomal-recessive mental retardation (ARMR) have been reported. In this study, we ascertained a consanguineous Pakistani family with ARMR in four living individuals from three branches of the family, plus an additional affected individual later identified as a phenocopy. Retinitis pigmentosa was present in affected individuals, but no other features suggestive of a syndromic form of MR were found. We used Affymetrix 500K microarrays to perform homozygosity mapping and identified a homozygous and haploidentical region of 11.2 Mb on chromosome 4p15.33-p15.2. Linkage analysis across this region produced a maximum two-point LOD score of 3.59. We sequenced genes within the critical region and identified a homozygous splice-site mutation segregating in the family, within a coiled-coil and C2 domain-containing gene, CC2D2A. This mutation leads to the skipping of exon 19, resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein lacking the C2 domain. Conservation analysis for CC2D2A suggests a functional domain near the C terminus as well as the C2 domain. Preliminary functional studies of CC2D2A suggest a possible role in Ca(2+)-dependent signal transduction. Identifying the function of CC2D2A, and a possible common pathway with CC2D1A, in correct neuronal development and functioning may help identify possible therapeutic targets for MR.",1
15537459,Which treatment for genital tract Chlamydia trachomatis infection?,"A national opportunistic chlamydia screening programme, mainly targeting young sexually active women, is gradually being introduced across the UK and in future will predominantly occur in primary care sites. The relative efficacy of recommended antibiotic treatments for chlamydia has been poorly studied and especially that of single dose azithromycin. In Portsmouth, 1536 patients treated for chlamydia, with four different antibiotic regimens, during the Department of Health pilot study, were asked to return for test of cure. No difference in treatment outcome was found using doxycycline, oxytetracycline, erythromycin or azithromycin. Directly observed therapy with azithromycin may be especially helpful in treating young chlamydia-positive patients.",0
32483373,C9orf72 suppresses systemic and neural inflammation induced by gut bacteria,"A hexanucleotide-repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic variant that contributes to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia(1,2). The C9ORF72 mutation acts through gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms to induce pathways that are implicated in neural degeneration(3-9). The expansion is transcribed into a long repetitive RNA, which negatively sequesters RNA-binding proteins(5) before its non-canonical translation into neural-toxic dipeptide proteins(3,4). The failure of RNA polymerase to read through the mutation also reduces the abundance of the endogenous C9ORF72 gene product, which functions in endolysosomal pathways and suppresses systemic and neural inflammation(6-9). Notably, the effects of the repeat expansion act with incomplete penetrance in families with a high prevalence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal dementia, indicating that either genetic or environmental factors modify the risk of disease for each individual. Identifying disease modifiers is of considerable translational interest, as it could suggest strategies to diminish the risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal dementia, or to slow progression. Here we report that an environment with reduced abundance of immune-stimulating bacteria(10,11) protects C9orf72-mutant mice from premature mortality and significantly ameliorates their underlying systemic inflammation and autoimmunity. Consistent with C9orf72 functioning to prevent microbiota from inducing a pathological inflammatory response, we found that reducing the microbial burden in mutant mice with broad spectrum antibiotics-as well as transplanting gut microflora from a protective environment-attenuated inflammatory phenotypes, even after their onset. Our studies provide further evidence that the microbial composition of our gut has an important role in brain health and can interact in surprising ways with well-known genetic risk factors for disorders of the nervous system.",1
24077481,Cognitive processes and functions in patients with type 2 diabetes in comparison to pre-diabetic patients,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is an important risk factor for cognitive decline in diabetic patients. The main goal of this study was the assessment of memory, attention and visuospatial ability dysfunctions in patients with type 2 diabetes in comparison to pre-diabetic patients and normal subjects in Endocrine and Metabolism Center of Isfahan City from April 2011 to July 2011. METHODS: The sample comprised of 32 patients with type 2 diabetes, 28 pre-diabetic patients and 30 healthy individuals. Memory, attention and visuospatial ability were assessed by Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) and sub tests of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-revised (WAIS-R).

METHODS: The aim of the study is to evaluate QT parameters in 11 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) 18 months after parathyroid surgery using computed standard 12-leads ECG compared to those of 29 healthy subjects (HS). RESULTS: In pHPT patients, 4 months after parathyroidectomy QT and QTc dispersion persist significantly higher than HS. 18 months after surgery, QT and QTc dispersion resulted comparable with HS. QT dispersion was found significantly higher in pHPT at 4 months respect 18 months after parathyroidectomy. CONCLUSIONS: ECG alteration after parathyroidectomy gradually return within normal limits and we can affirm that surgery erase bioelectrical risk in pHPT.",0
19815777,Arterial-venous segregation by selective cell sprouting: an alternative mode of blood vessel formation,"Blood vessels form de novo (vasculogenesis) or upon sprouting of capillaries from preexisting vessels (angiogenesis). With high-resolution imaging of zebrafish vascular development, we uncovered a third mode of blood vessel formation whereby the first embryonic artery and vein, two unconnected blood vessels, arise from a common precursor vessel. The first embryonic vein formed by selective sprouting of progenitor cells from the precursor vessel, followed by vessel segregation. These processes were regulated by the ligand EphrinB2 and its receptor EphB4, which are expressed in arterial-fated and venous-fated progenitors, respectively, and interact to orient the direction of progenitor migration. Thus, directional control of progenitor migration drives arterial-venous segregation and generation of separate parallel vessels from a single precursor vessel, a process essential for vascular development.",0

17900240,Human ornithine decarboxylase paralogue (ODCp) is an antizyme inhibitor but not an arginine decarboxylase,"ODC (ornithine decarboxylase), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, is regulated by specific inhibitors, AZs (antizymes), which in turn are inhibited by AZI (AZ inhibitor). We originally identified and cloned the cDNA for a novel human ODC-like protein called ODCp (ODC paralogue). Since ODCp was devoid of ODC catalytic activity, we proposed that ODCp is a novel form of AZI. ODCp has subsequently been suggested to function either as mammalian ADC (arginine decarboxylase) or as AZI in mice. Here, we report that human ODCp is a novel AZI (AZIN2). By using yeast two-hybrid screening and in vitro binding assay, we show that ODCp binds AZ1-3. Measurements of the ODC activity and ODC degradation assay reveal that ODCp inhibits AZ1 function as efficiently as AZI both in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate that the degradation of ODCp is ubiquitin-dependent and AZ1-independent similar to the degradation of AZI. We also show that human ODCp has no intrinsic ADC activity.",1
28469819,Evaluation of Antibacterial Efficacy of Photodynamic Therapy vs. 2.5% NaOCl against E. faecalis-infected Root Canals Using Real-time PCR Technique,"BACKGROUND: Bacteria like E. faecalis can produce intra- and extra-radicular biofilms. Theoretically, the adjustable penetration ability of lasers enables better access to root canal system. Therefore the aim of the present study was to compare the ability of photoactivated laser and 2.5% NaOCl irrigation solution to eliminate E. faecalis from the root canals by real-time PCR technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty extracted human upper central incisors were selected and sterilized in an autoclave. The root canals were infected with E. faecalis (PTCC 1237, Persian Type Culture Collection, Iran) and then incubated for 24 hours. The samples were randomly divided into 3 groups. No intervention was made in the control group (group 1). In group 2, laser therapy was performed with a power of 100 mW by diode laser for 120 seconds. In group 3, the canals were irrigated with 5 mL of 2.5% NaOCl; then all the samples were sonicated in 15 mL of normal saline in test tubes in order to isolate the bacteria. DNA extraction was performed followed by real-time PCR technique for all the samples. RESULTS: Inhibition of bacterial growth in all the experimental samples was significantly more than that in the control group. There was a significant difference between photodynamic therapy and 2.5% NaOCl. The effect of NaOCl in all the samples was better than photodynamic therapy. The results of the mean CT (cyclic threshold) were 40, 30.2 and 15.35 for 2.5% NaOCl, photodynamic therapy and control group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this experimental study, 2.5% NaOCl eliminated E. faecalis from infected root canals more effectively compared to photodynamic therapy.

8490660,Independent mutations of the human CD3-epsilon gene resulting in a T cell receptor/CD3 complex immunodeficiency,"The T-cell receptor (TCR) is composed of two glycoproteins (alpha and beta or gamma and delta) associated with four invariant polypeptides (CD3-gamma, delta, epsilon and zeta). The majority of TCR/CD3 complexes contain six polypeptide chains, and although there is some flexibility in the complex subunit stoichiometry the CD3-epsilon chain is central to CD3 core assembly and full complex formation. We have described previously defective expression of the TCR/CD3 complex in an immunodeficient child. We now report that two independent CD3-epsilon gene mutations present in the parents have segregated in the patient, leading to defective CD3-epsilon chain synthesis and preventing normal association and membrane expression of the TCR/CD3 complex.",1
10395400,Improved haemodynamics and restoration of spontaneous circulation with constant aortic occlusion during experimental cardiopulmonary resuscitation,"Continuous balloon occlusion of the descending aorta is an experimental method that may improve blood flow to the myocardium and the brain during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effects of this intervention on haemodynamics and the frequency of restoration of spontaneous circulation. Ventricular fibrillation was induced in 39 anaesthetised piglets, followed by an 8-min non-intervention interval. In a haemodynamic study (n = 10), closed chest CPR was performed for 7 min before the intra-aortic balloon was inflated. This intervention increased mean arterial blood pressure by 20%, reduced cardiac output by 33%, increased coronary artery blood flow by 86%, and increased common carotid artery blood flow by 62%. All these changes were statistically significant. Administration of epinephrine further increased mean arterial blood pressure and coronary artery blood flow, while cardiac output and common carotid artery blood flow decreased. In a study of short-term survival, nine out of 13 animals (69%) in the balloon group and in three out of 13 animals (23%) in the control group had spontaneous circulation restored. The difference between these two proportions was 0.46, which was statistically significant with a 95% confidence interval from 0.12 to 0.80. In conclusion, balloon occlusion of the descending aorta increased coronary and common carotid artery blood flow and the frequency of restoration of spontaneous circulation. It was also noted that epinephrine appears to augment the redistribution of blood flow caused by the aortic occlusion.",0
21688742,Comparisons of directly coded SEER Summary Stage 2000 and Collaborative Staging Derived SEER Summary Stage 2000,"This study assessed comparability of the directly coded Summary Stage 2000 and the Collaborative Stage (CS) Derived Summary Stage 2000 (SS2000) using 2001-2004 data from 40 population-based cancer registries in the United States that met the high quality criteria. The likelihood ratio test was employed to determine whether stage differences between 2003 (pre-CS) and 2004 (CS) were attributable to 2001-2004 linear trends, decreases in percentage of unknown stage cases, or both. Statistically significant differences in stage distribution between 2003 and 2004 were observed for 30 out of the 34 cancer sites. For 4 cancer sites, the differences were attributable to 2001-2004 linear trends of stage distribution. For 8 cancer sites, the differences were attributable to decreases in percentage of unknown stage cases alone or in combination with the temporal trends of stage distribution. For the remaining 18 cancer sites, either (1) no linear trends of stage distribution were identified or (2) the combination of the decline in cases with unknown stage plus linear trends did not explain the stage differences between 2003 and 2004. By comparing the SS2000 and CS manuals, we found differences in coding definitions for direct extension and/or lymph node involvement for all cancer sites except cancers of the breast, cervix, and cranial nervous and other nervous system. Evidence showed that the stage differences between 2003 and 2004 may be attributable in part to the implementation of the CS System for some cancer sites.",0
11469397,Slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats is preceded by impaired vasodilation in arterioles that overlie the sciatic nerve,"Diabetes mellitus produces marked abnormalities in motor nerve conduction, but the mechanism is not clear. In the present study we hypothesized that in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat impaired vasodilator function in arterioles that provide circulation to the region of the sciatic nerve is associated with reduced endoneural blood flow (EBF) and that these defects precede slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity, and thereby may contribute to nerve dysfunction. As early as three days after the induction of diabetes endoneural blood flow was reduced in the STZ-induced diabetic rat. Furthermore, after 1 week of diabetes acetylcholine-induced vasodilation was found to be impaired. This was accompanied by an increase in the superoxide level in arterioles that provide circulation to the region of the sciatic nerve as well as changes in the level of other markers of oxidative stress including an increase in serum levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and a decrease in lens glutathione level. In contrast to the vascular related changes that occur within 1 week of diabetes, motor nerve conduction velocity and sciatic nerve Na+/K+ ATPase activity were significantly reduced following 2 and 4 weeks of diabetes, respectively. These studies demonstrate that changes in vascular function in the STZ-induced diabetic rat precede the slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and are accompanied by an increase in superoxide levels in arterioles that provide circulation to the region of the sciatic nerve.",0

7652577,A p16INK4a-insensitive CDK4 mutant targeted by cytolytic T lymphocytes in a human melanoma,"A mutated cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) was identified as a tumor-specific antigen recognized by HLA-A2. 1-restricted autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in a human melanoma. The mutated CDK4 allele was present in autologous cultured melanoma cells and metastasis tissue, but not in the patient's lymphocytes. The mutation, an arginine-to-cysteine exchange at residue 24, was part of the CDK4 peptide recognized by CTLs and prevented binding of the CDK4 inhibitor p16INK4a, but not of p21 or of p27KIP1. The same mutation was found in one additional melanoma among 28 melanomas analyzed. These results suggest that mutation of CDK4 can create a tumor-specific antigen and can disrupt the cell-cycle regulation exerted by the tumor suppressor p16INK4a.",1
15219432,Effect of salt on the hybridization of DNA by sequential immobilization of oligonucleotides at the air-water interface in the presence of ODA/DOTAP monolayers,"The effect of low ionic strength on the binding of preformed DNA duplexes and the hybridization of single-stranded oligonucleotides at the air-water interface in the presence of cationic Langmuir monolayers of octadecylamine (ODA), as well as 1,2-dioleoyloxytrimethylammonium propane (DOTAP), is investigated. The complexation of the single-stranded DNA molecules and preformed duplexes with NaCl in solution with ODA/DOTAP Langmuir monolayers was followed in time by monitoring the pressure-area isotherms, wherein a very large and rapid expansion of the ODA/DOTAP monolayer was observed. In the case of sequential immobilization of complementary oligonucleotides, after addition of the complementary strand and intercalator, there was not much expansion, indicative of the fact that equilibrium had been rapidly achieved. Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of the ODA/DOTAP-DNA complex were formed on different substrates and characterized using quartz-crystal microgravimetry (QCM), fluorescence spectroscopy, and thermal melting studies. These measurements clearly showed that the preformed duplexes retained their native form as double helices and further, hybridization of the complementary single-stranded DNA molecules had occurred at the air-water interface, leading to the characteristic double-helical structure.",0
17491332,Functional models of movement disorders of basal ganglia origin and effects of functional neurosurgery,"The rate model regarding the development of movement disorders of basal ganglia origin suggests that hyperkinetic and hypokinetic disorders occur as a result of changes in the firing rates in the GPi and SNr, which in turn suppress thalamocortical output. Dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease increases basal ganglia output, then decreases thalamocortical output, leading to bradykinesia. This model, however, cannot explain a lack of deterioration of parkinsonian signs following thalamic coagulation surgery. Instead of the rate model, the beta oscillation hypothesis has been proposed, explaining that synchronized oscillation in the beta frequency in the basal ganglia disturbs initiation of voluntary movement. We observed that effective high-frequency STN stimulation in parkinsonian monkeys was associated with increase in the firing rate and the pattern shift from irregular burst firing to regular high-frequency firing in the projecting sites. High-frequency neural activation by deep brain stimulation is supposed to cancel lower frequency oscillation including beta oscillation, leading to improvement of bradykinesia. Our observation supports the significance of the neural activity pattern, rather than the tonic activity level, in the development of movement disorders. The rate model cannot explain the improvement of ballismus and chorea by pallidotomy because pallidotomy increases the disinhibition of the thalamocortical projection, which should increase the movements. We observed repetitive bursts or pauses of neuronal firing of the globus pallidus synchronized to ballistic movements in patients with hemiballism or chorea, suggesting that phasic neuronal driving in the basal ganglia is important as their pathophysiology.",0
12128131,Postoperative low-pelvic irradiation for stage I-IIA cervical cancer patients with risk factors other than pelvic lymph node metastasis,"PURPOSE: To retrospectively investigate whether postoperative low-pelvic radiotherapy (RT) is an appropriate treatment for node-negative, high-risk Stage I-IIA cervical cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 228 Stage I-IIA cervical cancer patients treated by radical surgery and postoperative RT were included in this study. All patients had histopathologically negative pelvic node metastasis, but at least one of the following risk factors: parametrial involvement, positive or close resection margins, invasion depth two-thirds or greater cervical stromal thickness. Seventy-nine patients (35%) received 30-50 Gy (median 44) to whole pelvis and a boost dose to the low pelvis (whole-pelvic RT group); the other 149 patients (65%) received low-pelvic RT only (low-pelvic RT group). For both groups, the total external RT dose to the low pelvis ranged from 40 to 60 Gy (median 50). The potential factors associated with survival, small bowel (gastrointestinal) complications, and leg lymphedema were analyzed, and patients who had a relapse in the upper pelvis were identified. RESULTS: The 5-year overall and disease-specific survival rate was 84% and 86%, respectively. After multivariate analysis, only bulky tumor (>or=4 cm) and non-squamous cell carcinoma were significantly associated with survival. Parametrial involvement, lymph-vascular invasion, <or=50.4 Gy to the low pelvis, positive or close margins, and low-pelvic RT alone did not significantly affect survival. Grade I-V small bowel complications occurred in 33 patients (15%). Whole pelvic RT and >50.4 Gy to the low pelvis, but not old age and treatment technique (AP-PA vs. box), were significantly associated with gastrointestinal complications. Three patients (2%) in the low-pelvic RT group and 6 patients (8%) in the whole-pelvic RT group were found to have Grade III or higher small bowel complications (p = 0.023). Thirty-one percent of patients developed lymphedema of the leg. A dose to the low pelvis >50.4 Gy and an AP-PA field, but not whole-pelvic RT, old age, or the number of sampled lymph nodes, were associated with lymphedema of the leg. Five patients (3.6%) of the low-pelvic RT group and none of the whole-pelvic RT group developed upper pelvis relapse. Three of these 5 patients had upper pelvic relapse alone. CONCLUSION: Compared with whole-pelvic RT plus low-pelvic boost, low-pelvic RT alone significantly reduces the small bowel complications in node-negative, high-risk, Stage I-IIA cervical cancer patients. Although low-pelvic RT alone increases the incidence of upper pelvic relapse, its effect on survival is not substantial. Low-pelvic RT alone appears to be an appropriate treatment method for this group of patients.",0
19723666,Immunodetection of DNA repair endonuclease ERCC1-XPF in human tissue,"The high incidence of resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs and severe side effects of chemotherapy have led to a search for biomarkers able to predict which patients are most likely to respond to therapy. ERCC1-XPF nuclease is required for nucleotide excision repair of helix-distorting DNA damage and the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks. Thus, it is essential for several pathways of repair of DNA damage by cisplatin and related drugs, which are widely used in the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma and other late-stage tumors. Consequently, there is tremendous interest in measuring ERCC1-XPF expression in tumor samples. Many immunohistochemistry studies have been done, but the antibodies for ERCC1-XPF were not rigorously tested for antigen specificity. Herein, we survey a battery of antibodies raised against human ERCC1 or XPF for their specificity using ERCC1-XPF-deficient cells as a negative control. Antibodies were tested for the following applications: immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation from cell extracts, immunofluorescence detection in fixed cells, colocalization of ERCC1-XPF with UV radiation-induced DNA damage in fixed cells, and immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded samples. Although several commercially available antibodies are suitable for immunodetection of ERCC1-XPF in some applications, only a select subset is appropriate for detection of this repair complex in fixed specimens. The most commonly used antibody, 8F1, is not suitable for immunodetection in tissue. The results with validated antibodies reveal marked differences in ERCC1-XPF protein levels between samples and cell types.",0

23525042,The neuron-specific chromatin regulatory subunit BAF53b is necessary for synaptic plasticity and memory,"Recent exome sequencing studies have implicated polymorphic Brg1-associated factor (BAF) complexes (mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes) in several human intellectual disabilities and cognitive disorders. However, it is currently unknown how mutations in BAF complexes result in impaired cognitive function. Postmitotic neurons express a neuron-specific assembly, nBAF, characterized by the neuron-specific subunit BAF53b. Mice harboring selective genetic manipulations of BAF53b have severe defects in long-term memory and long-lasting forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. We rescued memory impairments in BAF53b mutant mice by reintroducing BAF53b in the adult hippocampus, which suggests a role for BAF53b beyond neuronal development. The defects in BAF53b mutant mice appeared to derive from alterations in gene expression that produce abnormal postsynaptic components, such as spine structure and function, and ultimately lead to deficits in synaptic plasticity. Our results provide new insight into the role of dominant mutations in subunits of BAF complexes in human intellectual and cognitive disorders.",1

31525283,Nicotinic acid affects cytoskeleton remodeling via increasing the activity of gelsolin,"Our previous research has demonstrated that nicotinic acid (NA) might suppress the angiogenesis by modulating the expression of angiogenesis factors and promoting the cytoskeleton remodeling. However, the underlying mechanism need to be further elucidated. The intracellular Ca(2+) concentration was measured by a [Ca(2+) ] detection kit. The F-actin depolymerization was shown by immunofluorescence staining. The protein levels of F-actin and G-actin were determined by Western blot. The effects of NA treatment on the gelsolin-PI3Kalpha (p110alpha) interaction were investigated by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). NA treatment caused an initial drop and then induced a significant increase in [Ca(2+) ] with a time and dose dependent manner. In addition, NA promoted the depolymerization of F-actin and knockdown of gelsolin substantially rescued the effects caused by NA treatment. NA treatment significantly inhibited the interaction between phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) alpha (p110alpha) and gelsolin and addition of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) increased the protein level of F-actin and rescued the F/G-actin ratio. In conclusion, our results indicated NA treatment could interfere with the ability of PI3Kalpha (p110alpha) to inhibit the activity of gelsolin by decomposing PIP2 to produce PIP3, thereby increasing the activity of gelsolin, which ultimately acted on the remodeling of the cytoskeleton and exerted an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis.",0
9253787,National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery: 1994,"In 1994, 27.7 million surgical and nonsurgical procedures were performed during 18.4 million visits to ambulatory surgery settings. Eighty-five percent of the ambulatory procedures (23.4 million) were performed in hospital-based settings and 15 percent (4.3 million) were in freestanding settings. More than half of the ambulatory procedures were in three major categories: operations on the digestive system, the eye and the musculoskeletal system. The leading ambulatory procedures were extraction of lens (performed almost 2 million times), endoscopy of large intestine with or without biopsy (1.8 million) and insertion of prosthetic lens (1.6 million). Women had significantly more ambulatory surgery procedures than men. The ambulatory procedure performed most frequently on children under 15 was myringotomy. Also common for children were tonsillectomies and adenoidectomies. For those aged 15-44, frequently performed ambulatory procedures included endoscopies of large and small intestine; dilation and curettage of uterus; bilateral destruction or occlusion of fallopian tubes; and arthroscopy of knee. In the 45-64 year old group, endoscopies of large and small intestine were the most commonly performed ambulatory procedures. Extraction of lens and insertion of prosthetic lens were the leading ambulatory procedures for those 65 years and older, though endoscopies of large and small intestine were also performed frequently for this age group.",0
28834016,An Experimental Radical Electrophilicity Index,We present an experimental electrophilicity index () for the classification of radicals. The -scale is based on the equilibrium constant determined for the reversible addition of a radical R(.) to an aromatic radicophile (HisNH2 ). This experimental approach is in excellent agreement with the computed global electrophilicity index omega and serves to validate the latter.,0
12897784,Mutations associated with neutropenia in dogs and humans disrupt intracellular transport of neutrophil elastase,"Cyclic hematopoiesis is a stem cell disease in which the number of neutrophils and other blood cells oscillates in weekly phases. Autosomal dominant mutations of ELA2, encoding the protease neutrophil elastase, found in lysosome-like granules, cause cyclic hematopoiesis and most cases of the pre-leukemic disorder severe congenital neutropenia (SCN; ref. 3) in humans. Over 20 different mutations of neutrophil elastase have been identified, but their consequences are elusive, because they confer no consistent effects on enzymatic activity. The similar autosomal recessive disease of dogs, canine cyclic hematopoiesis, is not caused by mutations in ELA2 (data not shown). Here we show that homozygous mutation of the gene encoding the dog adaptor protein complex 3 (AP3) beta-subunit, directing trans-Golgi export of transmembrane cargo proteins to lysosomes, causes canine cyclic hematopoiesis. C-terminal processing of neutrophil elastase exposes an AP3 interaction signal responsible for redirecting neutrophil elastase trafficking from membranes to granules. Disruption of either neutrophil elastase or AP3 perturbs the intracellular trafficking of neutrophil elastase. Most mutations in ELA2 that cause human cyclic hematopoiesis prevent membrane localization of neutrophil elastase, whereas most mutations in ELA2 that cause SCN lead to exclusive membrane localization.",1
32490810,A size principle for recruitment of Drosophila leg motor neurons,"To move the body, the brain must precisely coordinate patterns of activity among diverse populations of motor neurons. Here, we use in vivo calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and behavior to understand how genetically-identified motor neurons control flexion of the fruit fly tibia. We find that leg motor neurons exhibit a coordinated gradient of anatomical, physiological, and functional properties. Large, fast motor neurons control high force, ballistic movements while small, slow motor neurons control low force, postural movements. Intermediate neurons fall between these two extremes. This hierarchical organization resembles the size principle, first proposed as a mechanism for establishing recruitment order among vertebrate motor neurons. Recordings in behaving flies confirmed that motor neurons are typically recruited in order from slow to fast. However, we also find that fast, intermediate, and slow motor neurons receive distinct proprioceptive feedback signals, suggesting that the size principle is not the only mechanism that dictates motor neuron recruitment. Overall, this work reveals the functional organization of the fly leg motor system and establishes Drosophila as a tractable system for investigating neural mechanisms of limb motor control.",0
27137361,Selectivity of 3-bromo-isoxazoline inhibitors between human and Plasmodium falciparum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases,"Compounds based on the 3-Br-isoxazoline scaffold fully inhibit glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Plasmodium falciparum by selectively alkylating all four catalytic cysteines of the tetramer. Here, we show that, under the same experimental conditions that led to a fast and complete inhibition of the protozoan enzyme, the human ortholog was only 25% inhibited, with the alkylation of a single catalytic cysteine within the tetramer. The partial alkylation seems to produce a slow conformational rearrangement that severely limits the accessibility of the remaining active sites to bulky 3-Br-isoxazoline derivatives, but not to the substrate or smaller alkylating agents.",0
11855834,Role of the Multidrug Resistance Protein 1 in protection from heavy metal oxyanions: investigations in vitro and in MRP1-deficient mice,"The Multidrug Resistance Protein 1 (MRP1) is a membrane pump that mediates the efflux of a wide variety of xenobiotics, including arsenical and antimonial compounds, as demonstrated by the study of MRP1-transfected cell lines. We have previously shown that mrp1(-/-) cells are hypersensitive to sodium arsenite, sodium arsenate, and antimony potassium tartrate. We now report that the retroviral vector-mediated overexpression of MRP1 and of the two subunits of gamma-GCS (heavy and light) resulted in higher intracellular glutathione levels and in a greater level of resistance to sodium arsenite and antimony potassium tartrate, compared to the overexpression of MRP1 and gamma-GCS heavy alone. These observations further demonstrate that glutathione is an important component of MRP1-mediated cellular resistance to arsenite and antimony. However, the constitutive expression of MRP1 did not protect mice from the lethality of sodium arsenite and antimony potassium tartrate nor reduced the tissue accumulation of arsenic in mice injected i.p. with sodium arsenite. It is conceivable that, in vivo, other pump(s) effectively vicariate for MRP1-mediated transport of heavy metal oxyanions.",1
8954059,Identification of novel missense mutations (Phe310Leu and Gly439Arg) in a neonatal case of hypophosphatasia,"Hypophosphatasia is associated with a defect of the tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase gene. We performed a mutational analysis in a surviving patient diagnosed at birth as having hypophosphatasia, on the basis of a low level of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and characteristic radiographical findings. She had two sisters, one of whom died of respiratory failure complicated by perinatal hypophosphatasia; the other seemed healthy, with a relatively low activity level of ALP. The patient's parents also had low ALP activity. Sequence analysis of the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase gene was performed, using genomic DNA and total RNA from the skin fibroblasts of the patient and the peripheral mononuclear cells of her parents. The conversion of Phe to Leu at codon 310 (F310L) and Gly to Arg at 439 (G439R) were identified in the patient. Interestingly, the reconstructive experiments demonstrated that the F310L mutant exhibited an ALP activity level 65% of the normal level, whereas the mutant G439R had no activity. Moreover, the digestion by StuI, after a PCR using complementary DNA extracted from fibroblasts of the patient and lymphocytes of her father, revealed a relatively low messenger RNA level of F310L. These findings suggest that the neonatal case of hypophosphatasia was associated with compound mutations, one of which caused the loss of ALP activity and the other of which caused a slight reduction of the ALP activity, with a relatively low level of messenger RNA.",1
17458871,Mutational analysis of 105 mucopolysaccharidosis type VI patients,"Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI; Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase B, ARSB) gene. ARSB is a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of the glycosaminoglycans (GAG) dermatan and chondroitin sulfate. ARSB mutations reduce enzyme function and GAG degradation, causing lysosomal storage and urinary excretion of these partially degraded substrates. Disease onset and rate of progression is variable, producing a spectrum of clinical presentation. In this study, 105 MPS VI patients-representing about 10% of the world MPS VI population-were studied for molecular genetic and biochemical parameters. Direct sequencing of patient genomic DNA was used to identify ARSB mutations. In total, 83 different disease-causing mutations were found, 62 of which were previously unknown. The novel sequence changes included: 38 missense mutations, five nonsense mutations, 11 deletions, one insertion, seven splice-site mutations, and four polymorphisms. ARSB mutant protein and residual activity were determined on fibroblast extracts for each patient. The identification of many novel mutations unique to individuals/their families highlighted the genetic heterogeneity of the disorder and provided an appropriate cohort to study the MPS VI phenotypic spectrum. This mutation analysis has identified a clear correlation between genotype and urinary GAG that can be used to predict clinical outcome.",1
11166748,"Screening for cervical neoplasia in a developing country utilizing cytology, cervicography and the acetic acid test","OBJECTIVE: To compare three screening tests for cervical neoplasia. METHOD: Women (6301) were screened simultaneously with cytology, cervicography and the acetic acid test (AAT). Biopsies were taken from the acetowhite lesions and every fifth seemingly normal cervix. Positive cases (both at screening and histology) were referred for colposcopy. The histology results served as the golden standard. RESULTS: Cytology was positive in 1.7% of cases, cervicography in 10.7% and the AAT in 17.8%. The sensitivity of cytology was 19.3%, of cervicography 41.8% and the AAT 49.4%. Corresponding specificities were 99.3%, 78.8% and 48.5%. In 23% of biopsies showing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (grade I--III), all three screening tests were negative. By combining the three tests, a sensitivity of 76.9% was achieved. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of cytology alone is not great enough for implementing as a screening test in a developing country where screening programs are often inadequate. Screening with a combination of tests, once or a few times per woman's life, is a more acceptable alternative since it allows for less screening events without sacrifying sensitivity.",0
9618175,Human metalloprotease-disintegrin Kuzbanian regulates sympathoadrenal cell fate in development and neoplasia,"The development of the sympathetic nervous system involves cell-cell interactions that regulate the fate and migration of progenitor neural cells. Recent evidence shows that focal membrane-bound protease activity is critical for such interactions. The Drosophila kuzbanian (kuz) gene is required in neurogenesis and encodes a highly conserved, membrane-bound metalloprotease- disintegrin closley related to theTNF-alphaconvertingenzyme (TACE). We have characterized the human and mouse kuz homologs and mapped human kuz to chromosome 15q22. During mouse embryonic development Kuz is expressed mainly in the sympathoadrenal and olfactory neural precursors. Once sympathoadrenal cells differentiate into chromaffin cells in the adult adrenal medulla, they no longer express Kuz. However, we found that tumors of sympathoadrenal origin, such as pheochromocytomas and neuroblastomas, overexpress Kuz. Further, transfection of a kuz construct lacking the protease domain, but not the full-length construct, induces neurite formation in PC12 chromaffin tumor cells. Taken together our results suggest a critical role for Kuz in regulation of sympathoadrenal cell fate.",1
29606302,Bi-allelic Alterations in AEBP1 Lead to Defective Collagen Assembly and Connective Tissue Structure Resulting in a Variant of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome,"AEBP1 encodes the aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP) that associates with collagens in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and has several roles in development, tissue repair, and fibrosis. ACLP is expressed in bone, the vasculature, and dermal tissues and is involved in fibroblast proliferation and mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into collagen-producing cells. Aebp1(-/-) mice have abnormal, delayed wound repair correlating with defects in fibroblast proliferation. In this study, we describe four individuals from three unrelated families that presented with a unique constellation of clinical findings including joint laxity, redundant and hyperextensible skin, poor wound healing with abnormal scarring, osteoporosis, and other features reminiscent of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Analysis of skin biopsies revealed decreased dermal collagen with abnormal collagen fibrils that were ragged in appearance. Exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous variants in AEBP1 (c.1470delC [p.Asn490_Met495delins(40)] and c.1743C>A [p.Cys581( *)]) in the first individual, a homozygous variant (c.1320_1326del [p.Arg440Serfs( *)3]) in the second individual, and a homozygous splice site variant (c.1630+1G>A) in two siblings from the third family. We show that ACLP enhances collagen polymerization and binds to several fibrillar collagens via its discoidin domain. These studies support the conclusion that bi-allelic pathogenic variants in AEBP1 are the cause of this autosomal-recessive EDS subtype.",1

7686976,RFLP analysis for APP 717 mutations associated with Alzheimer's disease,"Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) has been shown to be associated with three distinct point mutations within the same codon of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene. The mutation identified in the Indiana kindred is a G-->T transversion at the first position of the codon for amino acid 717, resulting in a substitution of phenylalanine for valine in the APP protein. Screening of persons at risk for the APP Phe-717 mutation using a variation of the polymerase chain reaction identified nine positives among 34 tested. In addition, DNA from 145 FAD subjects were tested for the three known APP 717 mutations.",1
4734403,The relationship of glycine-rich  -glycoprotein to factor B in the properdin system and to the cobra factor-binding protein of huan serum,"Factor B activity of the properdin system was found to be identical with purified glycine-rich beta-glycoprotein (GBG) but was distinct from the normal human serum protein capable of forming a C3-inactivating complex with a protein from cobra venom (CoF). Factor B activity coincided with electrophoretically separated GBG genetic variants, whereas the CoF-binding protein did not. GBGase destroyed factor B as it cleaved GBG but did not destroy the C3-inactivating activity of the CoF-binding protein. During incubation of serum with CoF, GBG did not change in molecular size, nor was there any coincidence in the immunoelectrophoretic mobilities of CoF and GBG. It was not possible to precipitate labeled CoF incubated with serum by anti-GBG, nor labeled GBG from serum incubated with CoF by anti-CoF. The CoF-binding capacity of serum was 2 mg/100 ml or less or under 6.5% of the serum concentration of GBG. When labeled CoF was added to serum below the binding capacity, complete complexation of the CoF was demonstrated, whereas CoF was largely uncomplexed when CoF was added in amounts equimolar to GBG.",1
16724006,A multistep mutation mechanism drives the evolution of the CAG repeat at MJD/SCA3 locus,"Despite the intense debate around the repeat instability reported on the large group of neurological disorders caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions, little is known about the mutation process underlying alleles in the normal range that, ultimately, expand to pathological size. In this study, we assessed the mutation mechanisms by which wild-type Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) alleles have been generated throughout human evolution. Haplotypes including the CAG repeat, six intragenic SNPs and four flanking microsatellites were analysed in 431 normal chromosomes of European, Asian and African origin. A bimodal CAG repeat length frequency distribution was found in the four most frequent wild-type lineages (H1-GCGGCA; H2-GTGGCA; H3-TTAGAC and H4-TTACAC). Based on flanking microsatellite haplotypes, the variance calculated by analysis of molecular variance between modal (CAG)n alleles was little or null in lineages H1, H2 and H4, as were the pairwise differences. Moreover, genetic distances among all the alleles from each lineage did not reflect the allele sizes differences, as expected if a stepwise mutation model was the main process of evolution. On the contrary, when exposed in maximum parsimonious phylogenetic trees, a large number of mutation steps separated same-size alleles, whereas several microsatellite haplotypes were shared by modal CAGs. In conclusion, our results suggest that the main mutation mechanism occurring in the evolution of the polymorphic CAG region at MJD/SCA3 locus is a multistep one, either by gene conversion or DNA slippage; repeats with 14, 21, 23 and 27 CAGs are the main alleles involved in this process.",1
33021841,The effect of intravenous thrombolytic therapy on post stroke depression and cognitive dysfunction: A 3-months follow up study,"Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of intravenous thrombolytic therapy with recombinant plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on functional recovery at 3-18 months following the treatment. The objectives of this study were to investigate differences between thrombolytic or no thrombolytic treatment and if could be a relationship between patients who have underwent the thrombolytic treatment in terms of depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment. In this retrospective study, we evaluated 92 patients affected by ischemic stroke recruited from our rehabilitation center, coming from a Stroke Unit. All the eligible subjects were assessed at admission (T0) and two months later, at discharge, upon concluded the rehabilitation program (T1). The patients were divided into two groups: Thrombolysis Group (n.40 subjects) and no Thrombolysis Group (n.52 subjects). Cognitive functions were evaluated with the Montreal Overall Cognitive Assessment. Functional status were evaluated with the Barthel Index and the Functional Independent Misure. We administered Beck Depression Inventory-II to verify the presence of a depressive state. We found that at three months after stroke, the prevalence of depressive symptoms and cognitive improvement, among patient who had undergone thrombolytic treatment, and who had not, was not different. Conversely, we found an improvement of depressive symptoms in each group.",0
9395479,Structural analysis of the human BIN1 gene. Evidence for tissue-specific transcriptional regulation and alternate RNA splicing,"BIN1 is a putative tumor suppressor that was identified through its interaction with the MYC oncoprotein. To begin to identify elements of BIN1 whose alteration may contribute to malignancy, we cloned and characterized the human BIN1 gene and promoter. Nineteen exons were identified in a region of >54 kilobases, six of which were alternately spliced in a cell type-specific manner. One alternately spliced exon encodes part of the MYC-binding domain, suggesting that splicing controls the MYC-binding capacity of BIN1 polypeptides. Four other alternately spliced exons encode amphiphysin-related sequences that were included in brain-specific BIN1 species, also termed amphiphysin isoforms or amphiphysin II. The 5'-flanking region of BIN1 is GC-rich and lacks a TATA box but directs transcriptional initiation from a single site. A approximately 0. 9-kilobase fragment from this region was sufficient for basal transcription and transactivation by MyoD, which may account for the high levels of BIN1 observed in skeletal muscle. This study lays the foundation for genetic and epigenetic investigations into the role of BIN1 in normal and neoplastic cell regulation.",1
19138753,Epigallocatechin-3-gallate augments antioxidant activities and inhibits inflammation during bleomycin-induced experimental pulmonary fibrosis through Nrf2-Keap1 signaling,"The mechanism involved in the enhancement of antioxidant activities and resolved inflammation after epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) treatment during bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis is investigated in this study. The levels of reactive-oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation (LPO), hydroxyproline and the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were increased due to bleomycin challenge and were brought back to near normal status on EGCG supplementation. The decreased antioxidant status due to bleomycin challenge was also restored upon EGCG treatment. Bleomycin-induced rats showed increased cell counts as compared to control and EGCG-treated rats. Histopathological analysis showed increased inflammation and alveolar damage, while picrosirius red staining showed an increased collagen deposition in bleomycin-challenged rats that were decreased upon EGCG treatment. Immunohistochemical, immunofluorescent and immunoblot studies revealed that EGCG supplementation decreased the levels of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), which were increased upon bleomycin induction. The declined activities of Phase II enzymes such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) in bleomycin-injured rats were restored upon EGCG treatment. Confocal microscopy, immunoblot and RT-PCR studies confirm that EGCG is a potent inducer of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Expression of Kelch like ECH-associated protein (Keap)-1, a vital factor in Nrf2 signaling cascade was analyzed by immunoblotting. However, there was no significant change in the expression of Keap1 in control and experimental groups. This study demonstrates the involvement of Nrf2-Keap1 signaling through which EGCG enhances antioxidant activities and Phase II enzymes with subsequent restraint inflammation during bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.",0
25918783,Cytotoxicity of the diterpene 14-O-methyl-ryanodanol from Erythroxylum passerinum in an astrocytic cells model,"Plant secondary metabolites, such as, specifically, alkaloids and terpenes, may present psychoactive properties that modify the function of the central nervous system (CNS) and induce neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity involves the response of glial cells, mainly astrocytes, which play a fundamental role in the control of homeostasis of the CNS. Some Erythroxylum species are indigenous to the state of Bahia in Brazil. This study investigated the cytotoxic activity of the diterpene AEP-1, extracted from the fruit of E. passerinum in a GL-15 cell line, astrocytic, glial cells model. The effects on cell viability, analyzed by the MTT assay, demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, with maximum effect at 500 mug/mL of AEP-1, and with a reduction of about 40 and 47% on cellular viability after 24 h and 72 h treatment, respectively. Evidence for induction of apoptosis by AEP-1 was first obtained when GL-15 glial cells were incubated with 250 mug/mL AEP-1 causing reniform and/or pyknotic nuclei and apoptotic bodies revealed by chromatin staining with Hoechst 33258. Increase in DNA fragmentation was also observed by comet assays in cells incubated with 500 mug/mL of AEP-1. Moreover, cells exposed to a sub toxic dose of AEP-1 (250 mug/mL) showed significant changes in morphology--contraction of the cytoplasm and expansion of cellular projections--signifying the presence of astrocytic cytoskeletal protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These findings indicated astrocytic cells as the target for terpene AEP-1 and suggest the involvement of glial cells with psychoactive symptoms observed in humans and animals after consumption of fruits of plants of the genus Erythroxylum.",0
30197642,A Novel Function for 15-Lipoxygenases in Cholesterol Homeostasis and CCL17 Production in Human Macrophages,"Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15) and arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, type B (ALOX15B) catalyze the dioxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and are upregulated in human alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) induced by Th2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) and/or interleukin-13. Known primarily for roles in bioactive lipid mediator synthesis, 15-lipoxygenases (15-LOXs) have been implicated in various macrophage functions including efferocytosis and ferroptosis. Using a combination of inhibitors and siRNAs to suppress 15-LOX isoforms, we studied the role of 15-LOXs in cellular cholesterol homeostasis and immune function in naive and AAMs. Silencing or inhibiting the 15-LOX isoforms impaired sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-2 signaling by inhibiting SREBP-2 processing into mature transcription factor and reduced SREBP-2 binding to sterol regulatory elements and subsequent target gene expression. Silencing ALOX15B reduced cellular cholesterol and the cholesterol intermediates desmosterol, lanosterol, 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, and lathosterol as well as oxysterols in IL-4-stimulated macrophages. In addition, attenuating both 15-LOX isoforms did not generally affect IL-4 gene expression but rather uniquely impacted IL-4-induced CCL17 production in an SREBP-2-dependent manner resulting in reduced T cell migration to macrophage conditioned media. In conclusion, we identified a novel role for ALOX15B, and to a lesser extent ALOX15, in cholesterol homeostasis and CCL17 production in human macrophages.",1
12418926,Histological and ultrastructural regulation in rabbit endometrial explants by estrogen in serum-free culture,"A repertoire of hormonal signals including estrogen regulate the growth, differentiation, and functioning of diverse target tissues, including the ovary, the mammary gland, and skeletal tissue. A serum-free culture system derived from rabbit endometrium explants has been devised and is reported here to explore estrogen action in vitro. The system involves aseptically harvesting the uterus from a virgin rabbit, dissecting the endometrium, explanting it into 1- to 2-mm(3) pieces weighing approximately 1-2 mg each, and incubating these pieces in serum-free Medium-199. The culture is carried out for a period of 4 d in a humidified CO(2) incubator at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2). The effect of extraneously added estrogen (1 microg/ml) was investigated by histological and ultrastructural procedures. It was observed that estrogen could induce specific changes, such as abundant mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, golgi complex, and intracellular collagen deposition, in both the epithelial and the fibroblast cell components of the explanted tissue. The study, therefore, indicates that the proposed system is an ideal tool for exploring and demonstrating estrogen responsiveness under in vitro conditions.",0
23366283,A comparative study of the 3D precentral gyrus model for unipolar and bipolar current stimulations,"Cortical stimulation (CS) is an appealing method for treating stroke and other disorders by promoting functional recovery. It is necessary to study the effect of different cortical stimulation types through numerical simulations in order to understand the underlying mechanism. In this paper, we simulated four types of invasive CS - unipolar ECS (epidural CS), bipolar ECS, unipolar SCS (subdural CS), and bipolar SCS - to investigate and compare the effects of stimulation types. Current stimulation was considered to increase the observability of the comparison between ECS and SCS. The simulation results obtained from the 3D precentral gyrus model showed ECS and SCS had similar current density distributions with higher stimulated current. However, the differences between bipolar and unipolar stimulation are significant with higher stimulated current. As stimulated current increased, unipolar CS penetrated deeper and wider regions than bipolar CS, so it can be more effective for functional recovery.",0
25292184,A novel mutation in calcium-sensing receptor gene associated to hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria,"BACKGROUND: Familial Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) and Familial benign Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH) are the most common causes of hereditary hypercalcemia. FHH has been demonstrated to be caused by inactivating mutations of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene, involved in PTH regulation as well as in renal calcium excretion. CASE PRESENTATION: In two individuals, father and son, we found a novel heterozygous mutation in CaSR gene. The hypercalcemia was present only in father, which, by contrast to the classic form of FHH showed hypercalciuria (from 300 to 600 mg/24 h in different evaluations) and a Calcium/Creatinine ratio of 0.031, instead of low or normal calciuria (<0.01 typical finding in FHH). His son showed the same mutation in CaSR gene, but no clinical signs or hypercalcemia although serum ionized calcium levels were close to the upper limit of normal values (1.30 mmol/L: normal range: 1.12-1.31 mmol/L). Sequence analysis revealed a point mutation at codon 972 of CaSR gene (chromosome 3q), located within cytoplasmic domain of the CaSR, that changes Threonine with Methionine. The father was treated with Cinacalcet 90 mg/day, with a decrease of total serum calcemia from an average value of 12.2 mg/dl to 10.9 mg/dl. CONCLUSION: This is a case of a novel inactivating point mutation of CaSR gene that determines an atypical clinical presentation of FHH, characterized by hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria and inadequate normal PTH levels. Functional assay demonstrated that the 972 M variant influenced the maturation of the protein, in terms of the post-translational glycosylation. The impairment of the receptor activity is in keeping with the specific localization of the 972 residue in the C-terminal tail, assigned to the intracellular signalling, that on the basis of the our findings appears to be differently modulated in parathyroid gland and in kidney.",1

24134052,Comparison of membrane insertion pathways of the apoptotic regulator Bcl-xL and the diphtheria toxin translocation domain,"The diphtheria toxin translocation domain (T-domain) and the apoptotic repressor Bcl-xL are membrane proteins that adopt their final topology by switching folds from a water-soluble to a membrane-inserted state. While the exact molecular mechanisms of this transition are not clearly understood in either case, the similarity in the structures of soluble states of the T-domain and Bcl-xL led to the suggestion that their membrane insertion pathways will be similar, as well. Previously, we have applied an array of spectroscopic methods to characterize the pH-triggered refolding and membrane insertion of the diphtheria toxin T-domain. Here, we use the same set of methods to describe the membrane insertion pathway of Bcl-xL, which allows us to make a direct comparison between both systems with respect to the thermodynamic stability in solution, pH-dependent membrane association, and transmembrane insertion. Thermal denaturation measured by circular dichroism indicates that, unlike the T-domain, Bcl-xL does not undergo a pH-dependent destabilization of the structure. Forster resonance energy transfer measurements demonstrate that Bcl-xL undergoes reversible membrane association modulated by the presence of anionic lipids, suggesting that formation of the membrane-competent form occurs close to the membrane interface. Membrane insertion of the main hydrophobic helical hairpin of Bcl-xL, alpha5-alpha6, was studied by site-selective attachment of environment-sensitive dye NBD. In contrast to the insertion of the corresponding TH8-TH9 hairpin into the T-domain, insertion of alpha5-alpha6 was found not to depend strongly on the presence of anionic lipids. Taken together, our results indicate that while Bcl-xL and the T-domain share structural similarities, their modes of conformational switching and membrane insertion pathways are distinctly different.

It is discussed under which circumstances an infranuclear lesion can simulate a supranuclear disorder of eye motility.,0
20032109,"Correlations in concentrations, xylem and phloem flows, and partitioning of elements and ions in intact plants. A summary and statistical re-evaluation of modelling experiments in Ricinus communis","Within the last two decades, a series of papers have dealt with the effects of nutrition and nutrient deficiency, as well as salt stress, on the long-distance transport and partitioning of nutrients in castor bean. Flows in xylem and phloem were modelled according to an empirically-based modelling technique that permits additional quantification of the uptake and incorporation into plant organs. In the present paper these data were statistically re-evaluated, and new correlations are presented. Numerous relationships between different compartments and transport processes for single elements, but also between elements, were detected. These correlations revealed different selectivities for ions in bulk net transport. Generally, increasing chemical concentration gradients for mineral nutrients from the rhizosphere to the root and from the xylem to leaf tissue were observed, while such gradients decreased from root tissue to the xylem and from leaves to the phloem. These studies showed that, for the partitioning of nutrients within a plant, the correlated interactions of uptake, xylem and phloem flow, as well as loading and unloading of solutes from transport systems, are of central importance. For essential nutrients, tight correlations between uptake, xylem and phloem flow, and the resulting partitioning of elements, were observed, which allows the stating of general models. For non-essential ions like Na(+) or Cl(-), a statistically significant dependence of xylem transport on uptake was not detected. The central role of the phloem for adjusting, but also signalling, of nutrition status is discussed, since strong correlations between leaf nutrient concentrations and those in phloem saps were observed. In addition, negative correlations between phloem sap sugar concentration and net-photosynthesis, growth, and uptake of nutrients were demonstrated. The question remains whether this is only a consequence of an insufficient use of carbohydrates in plants or a ubiquitous signal for stress in plants. In general, high sugar concentrations in phloem saps indicate (nutritional) stress, and high nutrient concentrations in phloem saps indicate nutritional sufficiency of leaf tissues.",0
6306228,Electrophysiological properties of rat spinal dorsal horn neurones in vitro: calcium-dependent action potentials,"1. The electrophysiological properties of dorsal horn neurones have been investigated in the immature rat in vitro spinal cord slice preparation. 2. Intracellular recordings from dorsal horn neurones show that direct or orthodromic stimulation generates action potentials followed by a brief after-hyperpolarization. Synaptic potentials were elicited by the activation of primary afferent fibres in the dorsal root. 3. Input resistance for dorsal horn neurones ranged from 48 to 267 M omega, and the membrane time constant was in the range of 4-19 ms. 4. In response to strong depolarizing currents dorsal horn neurones perfused with TTX and TEA frequently exhibit a slow regenerative depolarizing potential followed by a slow after-hyperpolarization. The depolarizing potential probably results from an influx of Ca. It is blocked by low concentration Ca, Co or Mn, and enhanced by high levels of extracellular Ca. 5. There is, in addition, a low-threshold Ca-dependent response which is activated at membrane potentials more negative than -65 mV and has a maximum rate of rise at the polarization level of about -80 mV. 6. The addition of Ba or TEA to the perfusing medium provided support for the Ca-dependence of the low- and high-threshold responses, and the lack of fast inactivation of the high-threshold Ca potential.",0
17554635,A Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 mutant with a higher tolerance toward the herbicide bentazone also confers resistance to sodium chloride stress,"Following a N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-based mutagenesis of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 wild type, we were able to select several mutants with an enhanced tolerance toward the herbicide bentazone (3-isopropyl-1H-2,1,3-benzothiadiazine-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide). Mutant Mu1 has in part been previously characterized. In the present paper we report on another mutant, called Mu2, which also has a higher tolerance toward bentazone. Since Mu2 showed a better growth than WT when cultivated with elevated NaCl concentrations in the growth medium and since S. elongatus WT has previously been classified to be low salt tolerant, we were especially interested in the identification of the modifications conferring this higher salt tolerance to mutant Mu2. Immunoblot analyses provided evidence that Mu2 had a constitutively higher expression of PsbO and of IsiA. In addition, in Mu2 a significantly higher concentration of IdiA was detected under salt stress as compared to WT. These three proteins most likely contribute to a better protection and/or stabilization of photosystem II. Moreover, Mu2 had a higher amount of the photosystem I reaction center proteins PsaAB under salt stress than WT. In addition, the amount of the ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase and also of the ATP synthase was constitutively higher in Mu2 than in WT. In contrast to WT the latter two proteins did not decrease under salt stress in Mu2. Therefore, it can be assumed that Mu2 could maintain a high cyclic electron transport activity around photosystem I under salt stress. It can be assumed that the combination of these modifications of the electron transport chain cause a better protection of photosystem II against oxidative damage and cause an increase of cyclic electron transport activity around photosystem I with ATP synthesis. Thus, the overall cellular energization in Mu2 relative to WT is improved. Together with putative other not yet identified modifications this seems to enable Mu2 to energize its cytoplasmic membrane-localized ion pumps more effectively than WT and, as a consequence, to keep the intracellular NaCl concentration low.",0
32724339,Anlotinib as a molecular targeted therapy for tumors,"Angiogenesis has an essential role in tumor growth and metastasis, and blocking this pathway has been a successfully utilized strategy in the clinical treatment of cancer. Anlotinib (AL3818) is a novel oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and 3, fibroblast growth factor 1-4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta, c-Kit and Ret. Anlotinib exerts inhibitory effects on tumor growth and angiogenesis and received its first approval as a third-line treatment for refractory advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in May 2018 and its second approval as a second-line treatment for advanced soft-tissue sarcoma in June 2019 in the People's Republic of China. Anlotinib has encouraging efficacy and a manageable and tolerable safety profile in a broad range of malignancies, including medullary thyroid cancer, renal cell cancer, gastric cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In the present review, the preclinical and clinical trials of anlotinib were summarized with a focus on safety evaluation and adverse event management.",0
29494183,Age differences in false memory: The importance of retrieval monitoring processes and their modulation by memory quality,"Older adults are more likely than younger adults to falsely recall past episodes that occurred differently or not at all. We examined whether older adults' propensity for false associative memory is related to declines in postretrieval monitoring processes and their modulation with varying memory representations. Younger (N = 20) and older adults (N = 32) studied and relearned unrelated scene-word pairs, followed by a final cued recall that was used to distribute the pairs for an associative recognition test 24 hours later. This procedure allowed individualized formation of rearranged pairs that were made up of elements of pairs that were correctly recalled in the final cued recall (",0
19666485,Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation directs recruitment and activation of an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler,"Posttranslational modifications play a key role in recruiting chromatin remodeling and modifying enzymes to specific regions of chromosomes to modulate chromatin structure. Alc1 (amplified in liver cancer 1), a member of the SNF2 ATPase superfamily with a carboxy-terminal macrodomain, is encoded by an oncogene implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we show that Alc1 interacts transiently with chromatin-associated proteins, including histones and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase Parp1. Alc1 ATPase and chromatin remodeling activities are strongly activated by Parp1 and its substrate NAD and require an intact macrodomain capable of binding poly(ADP-ribose). Alc1 is rapidly recruited to nucleosomes in vitro and to chromatin in cells when Parp1 catalyzes PAR synthesis. We propose that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of chromatin-associated Parp1 serves as a mechanism for targeting a SNF2 family remodeler to chromatin.",1
12215968,"GRACILE syndrome, a lethal metabolic disorder with iron overload, is caused by a point mutation in BCS1L","GRACILE (growth retardation, aminoaciduria, cholestasis, iron overload, lactacidosis, and early death) syndrome is a recessively inherited lethal disease characterized by fetal growth retardation, lactic acidosis, aminoaciduria, cholestasis, and abnormalities in iron metabolism. We previously localized the causative gene to a 1.5-cM region on chromosome 2q33-37. In the present study, we report the molecular defect causing this metabolic disorder, by identifying a homozygous missense mutation that results in an S78G amino acid change in the BCS1L gene in Finnish patients with GRACILE syndrome, as well as five different mutations in three British infants. BCS1L, a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein, is a chaperone necessary for the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III. Pulse-chase experiments performed in COS-1 cells indicated that the S78G amino acid change results in instability of the polypeptide, and yeast complementation studies revealed a functional defect in the mutated BCS1L protein. Four different mutations in the BCS1L gene have been reported elsewhere, in Turkish patients with a distinctly different phenotype. Interestingly, the British and Turkish patients had complex III deficiency, whereas in the Finnish patients with GRACILE syndrome complex III activity was within the normal range, implying that BCS1L has another cellular function that is uncharacterized but essential and is putatively involved in iron metabolism.",1

11067864,Nitric oxide and atrial natriuretic factor stimulate cGMP-dependent membrane insertion of aquaporin 2 in renal epithelial cells,"In collecting duct principal cells, aquaporin 2 (AQP2) is shuttled from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane upon vasopressin (VP) stimulation. VP activates adenylyl cyclase, increases intracellular cAMP, activating protein kinase A (PKA) to phosphorylate AQP2 on the COOH-terminal residue, serine 256. Using rat kidney slices and LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing AQP2 (LLC-AQP2 cells), we now show that AQP2 trafficking can be stimulated by cAMP-independent pathways. In these systems, the nitric oxide (NO) donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and NONOate and the NO synthase substrate L-arginine mimicked the effect of VP, stimulating relocation of AQP2 from cytoplasmic vesicles to the plasma membrane. Unlike VP, these other agents did not increase intracellular cAMP. However, SNP increased intracellular cGMP, and exogenous cGMP stimulated AQP2-membrane insertion. Atrial natriuretic factor, which signals via cGMP, also stimulated AQP2 translocation. The VP and SNP effects were blocked by the kinase inhibitor H89. SNP did not stimulate membrane insertion of AQP2 in LLC-PK1 cells expressing the phosphorylation-deficient mutant 256SerAla-AQP2, indicating that phosphorylation of Ser256 is required for signaling. Both PKA and cGMP-dependent protein kinase G phosphorylated AQP2 on this COOH-terminal residue in vitro. These results demonstrate a novel, cAMP-independent and cGMP-dependent pathway for AQP2 membrane insertion in renal epithelial cells.",1
12297508,Mammalian APH-1 interacts with presenilin and nicastrin and is required for intramembrane proteolysis of amyloid-beta precursor protein and Notch,"Presenilin and nicastrin are essential components of the gamma-secretase complex that is required for the intramembrane proteolysis of an increasing number of membrane proteins including the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and Notch. By using co-immunoprecipitation and nickel affinity pull-down approaches, we now show that mammalian APH-1 (mAPH-1), a conserved multipass membrane protein, physically associates with nicastrin and the heterodimers of the presenilin amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments in human cell lines and in rat brain. Similar to the loss of presenilin or nicastrin, the inactivation of endogenous mAPH-1 using small interfering RNAs results in the decrease of presenilin levels, accumulation of gamma-secretase substrates (APP carboxyl-terminal fragments), and reduction of gamma-secretase products (amyloid-beta peptides and the intracellular domains of APP and Notch). These data indicate that mAPH-1 is probably a functional component of the gamma-secretase complex required for the intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch.",1

20439478,"Role of trehalose biosynthesis in Aspergillus fumigatus development, stress response, and virulence","Aspergillus fumigatus is a pathogenic mold which causes invasive, often fatal, pulmonary disease in immunocompromised individuals. Recently, proteins involved in the biosynthesis of trehalose have been linked with virulence in other pathogenic fungi. We found that the trehalose content increased during the developmental life cycle of A. fumigatus, throughout which putative trehalose synthase genes tpsA and tpsB were significantly expressed. The trehalose content of A. fumigatus hyphae also increased after heat shock but not in response to other stressors. This increase in trehalose directly correlated with an increase in expression of tpsB but not tpsA. However, deletion of both tpsA and tpsB was required to block trehalose accumulation during development and heat shock. The DeltatpsAB double mutant had delayed germination at 37 degrees C, suggesting a developmental defect. At 50 degrees C, the majority of DeltatpsAB spores were found to be nonviable, and those that were viable had severely delayed germination, growth, and subsequent sporulation. DeltatpsAB spores were also susceptible to oxidative stress. Surprisingly, the DeltatpsAB double mutant was hypervirulent in a murine model of invasive aspergillosis, and this increased virulence was associated with alterations in the cell wall and resistance to macrophage phagocytosis. Thus, while trehalose biosynthesis is required for a number of biological processes that both promote and inhibit virulence, in A. fumigatus the predominant effect is a reduction in pathogenicity. This finding contrasts sharply with those for other fungi, in which trehalose biosynthesis acts to enhance virulence.",0
21862674,Identification of ADAMTS18 as a gene mutated in Knobloch syndrome,"BACKGROUND: Knobloch syndrome (KS) is a developmental disorder characterised by occipital skull defect, high myopia, and vitreo-retinal degeneration. Although genetic heterogeneity has been suspected, COL18A1 is the only known KS disease gene to date. OBJECTIVE: To identify a novel genetic cause of KS in a cohort of Saudi KS patients enrolled in this study. METHODS: When COL18A1 mutation was excluded, autozygosity mapping was combined with exome sequencing. RESULTS: In one patient with first cousin parents, COL18A1 was excluded by both linkage and direct sequencing. By filtering variants generated on exome sequencing using runs of autozygosity in this simplex case, the study identified ADAMTS18 as the only gene carrying a homozygous protein altering mutation. It was also shown that Adamts18 is expressed in the lens and retina in the developing murine eye. CONCLUSION: The power of combining exome and autozygome analysis in the study of genetics of autosomal recessive disorders, even in simplex cases, has been demonstrated.",1
21746973,Long-term results of primary trabeculectomies and Molteno implants for primary open-angle glaucoma,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the long-term outcomes of primary trabeculectomies and primary Molteno implants performed in cases of primary open-angle glaucoma at Dunedin Hospital. METHODS: Prospective comparative case series of 718 eyes (500 patients) and 260 eyes (195 patients) that had trabeculectomy and Molteno implants, respectively, at Dunedin Hospital as the first drainage operation for primary open-angle glaucoma between 1976 and 2007, and followed up for a mean of 7.7 (range, 0.0-28.0) and 5.0 (range, 0.0-27.4) years, respectively. RESULTS: The probability of intraocular pressure (IOP) control at 21 mm Hg or less following trabeculectomy at 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years was 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-0.97), 0.93 (95% CI, 0.91-0.96), 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86-0.92), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.78-0.86), 0.74 (95% CI, 0.68-0.80), and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.59-0.77), respectively. There were 96 (13%) failures (using the >21-mm Hg definition of failure) in the trabeculectomy group by the final follow-up. The probability of IOP control at 21 mm Hg or less following Molteno implant insertion at 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.97-1.0), 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-1.0), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.92-0.99), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.92-0.99), 0.91 (95% CI, 0.81-1.00), and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.81-1.00), respectively. In the Molteno implant group, there were 8 (3%) failures (using the >21-mm Hg definition of failure) by the final follow-up. CONCLUSION: Insertion of a Molteno implant provided superior IOP control to trabeculectomy when carried out as a first operation in cases of primary glaucoma.",0
31179968,Community Integration in Traumatic Brain Injury: The Contributing Factor of Affect Recognition Deficits,"OBJECTIVE: Individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) can experience social isolation, which is damaging to well-being and counterproductive to successful rehabilitation. It has been proposed that social cognitive deficits that commonly result from TBI may contribute to weakened social integration. However, the consequences of specific social cognitive deficits in TBI are still being delineated. The current work sought to better characterize the relationship between community integration and facial affect recognition (FAR) in TBI. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A total of 27 participants with moderate to severe TBI and 30 healthy controls (HCs) completed two tests of FAR, which employed either static photographic stimuli or dynamic video stimuli (The Awareness of Social Inference Test). The Community Integration Questionnaire was also administered to participants. RESULTS: Participants with TBI were significantly impaired on both the static and dynamic FAR measures, yet the deficits were most pronounced within the dynamic task. Furthermore, participants with TBI reported lower community integration compared with HCs. FAR was positively associated with community integration in both groups, such that participants with proficient affect recognition skills were better integrated into their communities. CONCLUSIONS: FAR deficits may contribute to the lack of community integration often observed in TBI; thus, interventions designed to improve FAR may be beneficial to this population's ability to successfully reintegrate into society.",0
1832678,Distinct ankyrin isoforms at neuron cell bodies and nodes of Ranvier resolved using erythrocyte ankyrin-deficient mice,"Isoforms of ankyrin (ankyrinsR) immunologically related to erythrocyte ankyrin (ankyrinRo) are associated with distinct neuronal plasma membrane domains of functional importance, such as cell bodies and dendrites, axonal hillock and initial segments, and nodes of Ranvier. AnkyrinRo is expressed in brain, and accounts for at least one of the ankyrinR isoforms. Another ankyrin isoform of brain, ankyrinB, is encoded by a distinct gene and is immunologically distinct from ankyrinsR. Mutant mice with normoblastosis (nb/nb) constitute the first described genetic model of ankyrin deficiency: they display a severe hemolytic anemia due to a significantly reduced expression of the ankyrinRo gene in reticulocytes as well as brain (Peters L. L., C. S. Birkenmeier, R. T. Bronson, R. A. White, S. E. Lux, E. Otto, V. Bennett, A. Higgins, and J. E. Barker. 1991. J. Cell Biol. 114:1233-1241). In the present report, we distinguish between ankyrinRo and other ankyrinR isoforms using immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence localization of ankyrinsR throughout the nervous system (forebrain, cerebellum, brain stem, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve) of nb/nb and normal mice. This is the first immunocytochemical characterization of the neurological component of the nb mutation and shows the following. (a) The isoform of ankyrin at the nodes of Ranvier and initial axonal segments is present in the nb/nb mice and does not cross-react with an ankyrinRo-specific antibody; this isoform, therefore, is distinct from both ankyrin isoforms identified in brain, ankyrinRo and ankyrinB, and is probably the product of a distinct gene and a unique component of the specialized membrane skeleton associated with nodes of Ranvier. (b) AnkyrinRo missing from nb/nb mice is selectively associated with neuronal cell bodies and dendrites, excluded from myelinated axons, and displays a selective pattern of expression in the nervous system whereby expression is almost ubiquitous in neurons of the cerebellum (Purkinje and granule cells) and spinal cord, and restricted to a very minor subset of neurons in hippocampus and neocortex of forebrain.",1
15509661,MAPK signaling regulates endothelial cell assembly into networks and expression of MT1-MMP and MMP-2,"Microvascular endothelial cells embedded within three-dimensional (3D) type I collagen matrixes assemble into cellular networks, a process that requires the upregulation of membrane type 1 (MT1) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and MMP-2. The purpose of this study was to identify the signaling pathways responsible for the transcriptional activation of MT1-MMP and MMP-2 in endothelial cells in 3D collagen lattices. We hypothesized that the 3D type I collagen induction of MT1-MMP and MMP-2 is mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase family of enzymes. Here, we show that 3D type I collagen elicits a persistent increase in ERK1/2 and JNK activation and a decrease in p38 activation. Inhibition of ERK1/2 or JNK disrupted endothelial network formation in 3D type I collagen lattices, whereas inhibition of p38 promoted network formation. mRNA levels of both MT1-MMP and MMP-2 were attenuated by ERK1/2 inhibition but unaffected by either JNK or p38 inhibition. By contrast, expression of constitutively active MEK was sufficient to stimulate MMP-2 production in a monolayer of endothelial cells cultured on type I collagen. These results provide evidence that signaling through both ERK1/2 and JNK regulates endothelial assembly into cellular networks but that the ERK1/2 signaling cascade specifically regulates network formation and the production of both MT1-MMP and MMP-2 genes in response to 3D type I collagen.",0
2283375,Determination of pseudouridine in human urine and serum by high-performance liquid chromatography with post-column fluorescence derivatization,"A selective and sensitive method for the determination of pseudouridine in human urine and serum is described. The method is based on high-performance liquid chromatography with post-column fluorescence derivatization. Pseudouridine and 5-fluorouridine (internal standard) in a 10-fold diluted urine sample or a deproteinized serum sample are separated on a reversed-phase column (TSK gel ODS-80) with isocratic elution and successively subjected to derivatization involving periodate oxidation followed by fluorescence reaction with meso-1,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)ethylenediamine. The detection limit for pseudouridine is 4 pmol in a 100-microliters injection volume.",0
6410510,Copper deficiency in humans,"Copper is an essential trace element that is required for a number of enzymes which are necessary for normal metabolic function. Metabolic balance studies have demonstrated that daily copper losses are approximately 1.3 mg/day. In order to remain in copper balance, the average adult male must consume a diet which contains at least 2 mg copper/day. It has been assumed that most diets satisfy this requirement because of the ubiquitous presence of copper in most foodstuffs. Recent studies, however, have shown that dietary copper may often fall below the estimated daily needs. Nevertheless, clinically evident copper deficiency has been documented in only a few situations. Of these disorders. Menkes' syndrome has been most intensively studied. This x-linked abnormality is associated with copper deficiency due to impaired gastrointestinal copper absorption. However, the clinical disorder cannot be corrected readily with copper replacement, thus suggesting that Menkes' syndrome may reflect more than simple copper deficiency. Nutritional copper deficiency appears to be well documented in two situations: (1) the newborn, usually premature, undergoing rapid growth on a diet poor in copper, and (2) the patient maintained on total parenteral nutrition for long periods of time without copper supplementation. In both of these situations, anemia and neutropenia are the most striking hematologic abnormalities associated with copper deficiency. Sideroblastic changes as well as nuclear maturation defects observed in erythroid precursors. However, suggest that there is an effect of copper deficiency on the hematopoietic system which cannot be explained solely by defective plasma iron transport.",0
26596623,"Reclassification of Desulfurococcus mobilis as a synonym of Desulfurococcus mucosus, Desulfurococcus fermentans and Desulfurococcus kamchatkensis as synonyms of Desulfurococcus amylolyticus, and emendation of the D. mucosus and D. amylolyticus species descriptions","Representatives of the crenarchaeal genus Desulfurococcus are strictly anaerobic hyperthermophiles with an organotrophic type of metabolism. Since 1982, five Desulfurococcus species names have been validly published: Desulfurococcus mucosus, D. mobilis, D. amylolyticus, D. fermentans and D. kamchatkensis. Recently, the genomic sequences of all five species became available, promoting the refinement of their taxonomic status. Analysis of full-length high-quality 16S rRNA gene sequences shows that the sequences of D. mobilis and D. mucosus are 100 % identical and differ by 2.2 % from those of D. amylolyticus, D. fermentans and D. kamchatkensis. The latter three sequences differ from each other by 0.1-0.3 % (99.9 % similarity in the D amylolyticus-D. kamchatkensis pair and 99.7 % in the pairs involving D. fermentans). In silico prediction of DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) values by comparison of genomes using ggdc 2.0 blast+ at http://ggdc.dsmz.de/ produced results that correlated with the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values. In the D. mucosus-D. mobilis and D. amylolyticus-D. kamchatkensis pairs, the predicted DDH values were 99 and 92 %, respectively, much higher than the recommended 70 % species-delimiting DDH value. Between members of different pairs, these values were no higher than 20 %. For D. fermentans, its predicted DDH values were around 70 % with D. amylolyticus and D. kamchatkensis and no higher than 20 % with D. mobilis and D. mucosus. These results indicated that D. mobilis should be reclassified as a synonym of D. mucosus, whereas D. kamchatkensis and D. fermentans should be reclassified as synonyms of D. amylolyticus. ",0
9536092,Caveolin-3 in muscular dystrophy,"The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) serves as a link between cytoplasmic actin, the membrane and the extracellular matrix of striated muscle. Genetic defects in genes encoding a subset of DGC proteins result in muscular dystrophy and a secondary decrease in other DGC proteins. Caveolae are dynamic structures that have been implicated in a number of functions including endocytosis, potocytosis and signal transduction. Caveolin (VIP-21) is thought to play a structural role in the formation of non-clathrin-coated vesicles in a number of different cell types. Caveolin-3, or M-caveolin, was identified as a muscle-specific form of the caveolin family. We show that caveolin-3 co-purifies with dystrophin, and that a fraction of caveolin-3 is a dystrophin-associated protein. We isolated the gene for human caveolin-3 and mapped it to chromosome 3p25. We determined the genomic organization of human caveolin-3 and devised a screening strategy to look for mutations in caveolin-3 in patients with muscular dystrophy. Of 82 patients screened, two nucleotide changes were found that resulted in amino acid substitutions (G55S and C71W); these changes were not seen in a control population. The amino acid changes map to a functionally important domain in caveolin-3, suggesting that these are not benign polymorphisms and instead are disease-causing mutations.",1
28241565,Millimeter-resolution long-range OFDR using ultra-linearly 100 GHz-swept optical source realized by injection-locking technique and cascaded FWM process,"In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a millimeter-resolution long-range optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) using an ultra-linearly 100-GHz swept optical source realized by injection-locking technique and cascaded four-wave-mixing (FWM) process. The ultra-linear sweep is realized using an external modulation method with a linearly swept radio frequency (RF) signal. The RF signal sweeps from 16 GHz to 19.3 GHz, and the slave laser is injection-locked to the 8th-order sideband of the master laser, achieving a frequency sweeping span of ~25 GHz. By using the injection-locked frequency-swept laser as the optical source of OFDR, we obtain a spatial resolution of 4.2 mm over 10-km measurement range. A polarization beat length of 10.5 cm is measured benefiting from the high spatial resolution. To improve the spatial resolution further, FWM process is used to broaden the frequency sweeping span. Frequency sweeping span of ~100 GHz is achieved with cascaded FWM. We demonstrate a 1.1-mm spatial resolution over 2-km measurement range with the proposed ultra-linearly swept optical source.",0
1985452,A mutant allele common to the type I adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency in Japanese subjects,"Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency is a genetic disorder which causes 2,8-dihydroxy-adenine urolithiasis. The estimated incidence of heterozygosity in Caucasian and Japanese populations is 1%. Mutant alleles responsible for the disease have been classified as APRT*Q0 (type I) and APRT* (type II). In our previous study, we demonstrated in APRT*J a single common base change which accounts for 70% of the Japanese mutants. The present report describes the analysis of an APRT*Q0 mutation in Japanese subjects. Two nucleotide substitutions common to all seven affected alleles from four unrelated subjects (three homozygotes and a heterozygote) were identified: G----A at nucleotide position 1453 and C----T at 1456. The G----A altered the amino acid Trp98 to a stop codon. The C----T did not alter Ala99. These point mutations were demonstrated by sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified genomic DNA and cDNA. The G----A change at 1453 results in the elimination of a PflMI site in the APRT gene. PflMI digests, which were used to confirm the G----A transition, can be useful in screening for this specific mutation.",1
8929946,Association between alcoholism and the dopamine D4 receptor gene,"A point mutation in the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2(2) allele) is considered to be a genetic deterrent for alcoholism; however, 80 of 655 Japanese alcoholics had the mutant allele. Genotype factors that might increase susceptibility by overriding the deterrent showed a higher frequency of a five repeat allele of the dopamine D4 receptor 48 bp repeat polymorphism in alcoholics with ALDH2(2) than in 100 other alcoholics and 144 controls. Alcoholics with the five repeat allele also abused other drugs more often. These data suggest the involvement of the dopamine system in the development of alcoholism and other addictive behaviour.",1
24458223,Impact of macrolide therapy in patients hospitalized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa community-acquired pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have described a clinical benefit of macrolides due to their immunomodulatory properties in various respiratory diseases. We aimed to assess the effect of macrolide therapy on mortality in patients hospitalized for Pseudomonas aeruginosa community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: We performed a retrospective population-based study of &gt; 150 hospitals in the US Veterans Health Administration. Patients were included if they had a diagnosis of CAP and P aeruginosa was identified as the causative pathogen. Patients with health-care-associated pneumonia and immunosuppression were excluded. Macrolide therapy was considered when administered within the first 48 h of admission. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed using 30-day mortality as the dependent measure. RESULTS: We included 402 patients with P aeruginosa CAP, of whom 171 (42.5%) received a macrolide during the first 48 h of admission. These patients were older and white. Macrolide use was not associated with lower 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.70-1.83; P = .5). In addition, patients treated with macrolides had no differences in ICU admission, use of mechanical ventilation, use of vasopressors, and length of stay (LOS) compared with patients not treated with macrolides. A subgroup analysis among patients with P aeruginosa CAP in the ICU showed no differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Macrolide therapy in the first 48 h of admission is not associated with decreased 30-day mortality, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and LOS in hospitalized patients with P aeruginosa CAP. Larger cohort studies should address the benefit of macrolides as immunomodulators in patients with P aeruginosa CAP.",0
19853926,Knocking off the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS): their roles in mammalian pregnancy,"This review discusses the possible role of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins in mammalian reproduction. SOCS are regulatory proteins that are rapidly transcribed in response to intracellular Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling, a cascade governing biological functions including cytokine-induced immunological responses and reproductive processes. For instance STAT3 appears to mediate trophoblast invasion induced by LIF. The SOCS family includes 8 members (cytokine-inducible SH2 protein [CIS] and SOCS1-7) that orchestrate distinct reactions by antagonizing STAT activation. Emerging evidence points to a role of some family members in synchronizing Th1/Th2 cell profiles, the balance in which is considered vital to pregnancy maintenance. The reproductive phenotypes of mutant mice harboring targeted disruption of SOCS gene isoforms offer insights for reproductive immunology, trophoblast function and human pregnancy. CIS transgenic mice display impaired responses to IL-2 and resemble STAT5 deficient mice, except they are fertile. SOCS1 deficiency leads to an overabundance of IFNgamma signaling, yet SOCS1 null mutant mice are able to reproduce. Lack of SOCS3 is embryonically lethal due to placental insufficiency, while SOCS3 over-expression leads to elevated Th2 responses. SOCS3 seems to be vital for reproduction by regulating LIF-driven trophoblast differentiation. SOCS5 inhibits IL-4 signaling, yet the SOCS5 transgenic mouse has no conspicuous reproductive phenotype. SOCS-6 and SOCS-7 null mutant mice display growth retardation. In summary, SOCS proteins are avidly involved in fine regulation of immunological and other vital cellular responses. Many of the above phenotypes present contradictions to accepted reproductive immunological paradigms.",0
2122236,"Molecular cloning and expression of a G25K cDNA, the human homolog of the yeast cell cycle gene CDC42","G25K is a low-molecular-mass GTP-binding protein with a broad distribution in mammalian tissues. A cDNA clone was isolated by using oligonucleotides corresponding to the partial amino acid sequence of purified human G25K. The cDNA encodes an 191-amino-acid polypeptide containing GTP-binding consensus sequences and a putative farnesylation site at the C terminus. The sequence exhibits 50 and 70% identities to the mammalian rho and rac proteins, respectively, and an 80% identity to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC42 gene product. Insect Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus vectors expressing the G25K cDNA produced a 25-kDa protein that bound GTP and was recognized by antibodies specifically reactive to G25K. G25K appears to be the human homolog of the CDC42 gene product, since expression of the G25K cDNA in S. cerevisiae suppressed both cdc42-1 and cdc24-4 temperature-sensitive lethal mutations.",1
17236131,Multiple genes for essential-hypertension susceptibility on chromosome 1q,"Essential hypertension, defined as elevated levels of blood pressure (BP) without any obvious cause, is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, stroke, and renal disease. BP levels and susceptibility to development of essential hypertension are partially determined by genetic factors that are poorly understood. Similar to other efforts to understand complex, non-Mendelian phenotypes, genetic dissection of hypertension-related traits employs genomewide linkage analyses of families and association studies of patient cohorts, to uncover rare and common disease alleles, respectively. Family-based mapping studies of elevated BP cover the large intermediate ground for identification of genes with common variants of significant effect. Our genomewide linkage and candidate-gene-based association studies demonstrate that a replicated linkage peak for BP regulation on human chromosome 1q, homologous to mouse and rat quantitative trait loci for BP, contains at least three genes associated with BP levels in multiple samples: ATP1B1, RGS5, and SELE. Individual variants in these three genes account for 2-5-mm Hg differences in mean systolic BP levels, and the cumulative effect reaches 8-10 mm Hg. Because the associated alleles in these genes are relatively common (frequency >5%), these three genes are important contributors to elevated BP in the population at large.",1
10358086,"Characterization of a novel giant scaffolding protein, CG-NAP, that anchors multiple signaling enzymes to centrosome and the golgi apparatus","A novel 450-kDa coiled-coil protein, CG-NAP (centrosome and Golgi localized PKN-associated protein), was identified as a protein that interacted with the regulatory region of the protein kinase PKN, having a catalytic domain homologous to that of protein kinase C. CG-NAP contains two sets of putative RII (regulatory subunit of protein kinase A)-binding motif. Indeed, CG-NAP tightly bound to RIIalpha in HeLa cells. Furthermore, CG-NAP was coimmunoprecipitated with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), when one of the B subunit of PP2A (PR130) was exogenously expressed in COS7 cells. CG-NAP also interacted with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 in HeLa cells. Immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells revealed that CG-NAP was localized to centrosome throughout the cell cycle, the midbody at telophase, and the Golgi apparatus at interphase, where a certain population of PKN and RIIalpha were found to be accumulated. These data indicate that CG-NAP serves as a novel scaffolding protein that assembles several protein kinases and phosphatases on centrosome and the Golgi apparatus, where physiological events, such as cell cycle progression and intracellular membrane traffic, may be regulated by phosphorylation state of specific protein substrates.",1
7769107,Expression of two human skeletal calcitonin receptor isoforms cloned from a giant cell tumor of bone. The first intracellular domain modulates ligand binding and signal transduction,"Two distinct calcitonin (CT) receptor (CTR)-encoding cDNAs (designated GC-2 and GC-10) were cloned and characterized from giant cell tumor of bone (GCT). Both GC-2 and GC-10 differ structurally from the human ovarian cell CTR (o-hCTR) that we cloned previously, but differ from each other only by the presence (GC-10) or absence (GC-2) of a predicted 16-amino acid insert in the putative first intracellular domain. Expression of all three CTR isoforms in COS cells demonstrated that GC-2 has a lower binding affinity for salmon (s) CT (Kd approximately 15 nM) than GC-10 or o-hCTR (Kd approximately 1.5 nM). Maximal stimulatory concentrations of CT resulted in a mean accumulation of cAMP in GC-2 transfected cells that was greater than eight times higher than in cells transfected with GC-10 after normalizing for the number of receptor-expressing cells. The marked difference in maximal cAMP response was also apparent after normalizing for receptor number. GC-2 also demonstrated a more potent ligand-mediated cAMP response compared with GC-10 for both human (h) and sCT (the EC50 values for GC-2 were approximately 0.2 nM for sCT and approximately 2 nM for hCT; EC50 values for GC-10 were approximately 6 nM for sCT and approximately 25 nM for hCT). Reverse transcriptase PCR of GCT RNA indicated that GC-2 transcripts are more abundant than those encoding for GC-10. In situ hybridization on GCT tissue sections demonstrated CTR mRNA expression in osteoclast-like cells. We localized the human CTR gene to chromosome 7 in band q22. The distinct functional characteristics of GC-2 and GC-10, which differ in structure only in the first intracellular domain, indicate that the first intracellular domain of the CTR plays a previously unidentified role in modulating ligand binding and signal transduction via the G protein/adenylate cyclase system.",1
10671513,Regulation of tumor cell chemotaxis by type IV collagen is mediated by a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism requiring CD47 and the integrin alpha(V)beta(3),"Studies from our laboratories demonstrated that synthetic peptides from the non-collagenous (NC-1) domain of the alpha3 (IV) chain of type IV collagen (COL IV) enhanced tumor cell adhesion (Han, J., Ohno, N., Monboisse, J. C., Pasco, S., Borel, J. P., and Kefalides, N. A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 20395-20401). We have isolated the receptors for the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide from melanoma and prostate tumor cells and identified them as CD47/integrin-associated protein and the integrin alpha(V)beta(3) (Shahan, T. A., Ziaie, Z., Pasco, S., Fawzi, A., Bellon, G., Monboisse, J. C., and Kefalides, N. A. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 4584-4590). In the present study we have examined the effect of CD47 and the integrin alpha(V)beta(3) on in vitro tumor cell chemotaxis and Ca(2+)(i) modulation in response to COL IV, from the anterior lens capsule (ALC-COL IV) and peptides from its NC-1 domain. COL IV as well as the alpha3(IV) peptide promoted tumor cell chemotaxis with an immediate increase in intracellular [Ca(2+)]. Treating tumor cells with CD47 and integrin alpha(V)beta(3)-reactive antibodies reduced chemotaxis as well as the rise in [Ca(2+)](i) in response to ALC-COL IV or the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide but not to Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm-COL IV or fibronectin. The alpha3(IV)185-203 synthetic peptide stimulated an increase in calcium from intracellular stores exclusively, whereas ALC-COL IV, Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm-COL IV, and fibronectin stimulated Ca(2+) flux from both internal and external stores. Furthermore, treatment of the cells with Ca(2+) chelator bis-(O-aminophenoxyl)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraaceticacid- acetomethoxy ester inhibited chemotaxis toward both ALC-COL IV and the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide. These data indicate that CD47 and integrin alpha(V)beta(3) regulate tumor cell chemotaxis in response to COL IV and the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide through a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism.",0
8841191,Ashkenazi Jewish population frequencies for common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2,"BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two major identified causes of inherited breast cancer, with mutations in either gene conferring up to 80-90% lifetime risk of breast cancer in carrier females. Mutations in BRCA1 account for approximately 45% of familial breast cancer and 90% of inherited breast/ovarian cancer, whereas mutations in BRCA2 account for a comparable percentage of inherited breast cancer cases. Over 85 distinct BRCA1 mutations and a growing list of BRCA2 mutations have been identified, with the majority resulting in protein truncation. A specific BRCA1 mutation, 185delAG, has a reported increased carrier frequency of approximately 0.9% in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, but is also found in rare non-Jewish patients with a different haplotype. The 6174delT mutation in BRCA2 was recently identified as a frequent mutation in 8 out of 107 Ashkenazi Jewish women diagnosed with breast cancer by age 50 (ref. 8), as well as in three Ashkenazi male breast cancer patients. We have conducted a large-scale population study to investigate the prevalence of specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals who were unselected for breast cancer. BRCA1 mutation screening on approximately 3,000 Ashkenazi Jewish samples determined a carrier frequency of 1.09% for the 185delAG mutation and 0.13% for the 5382insC mutation. BRCA2 analysis on 3,085 individuals from the same population showed a carrier frequency of 1.52% for the 6174delT mutation. This expanded population-based study confirms that the BRCA1 185delAG mutation and the BRCA2 6174delT mutation constitute the two most frequent mutation alleles predisposing to hereditary breast cancer among the Ashkenazim, and suggests a relatively lower penetrance for the 6174delT mutation in BRCA2.",1
8095918,Prevalence of common mutations in the arylsulphatase A gene in metachromatic leukodystrophy patients diagnosed in Britain,"The frequency of two common disease-associated mutations in the arylsulphatase A (ASA) gene, and of a mutation causing ASA pseudodeficiency, have been established in metachromatic leukodystrophy patients diagnosed in our laboratory. A total of 37 mutant genes have been analysed. The G-->A change destroying the splice donor site of exon 2 is generally associated with more severe disease and was found in 43.2% of mutant ASA genes. The C-->T transition causing a proline to leucine substitution at position 426 in exon 8 (P426-->L) is associated with later onset disease, and was found in 16.2% of mutant genes. The A-->G transition leading to loss of a polyadenylation signal associated with ASA pseudodeficiency was present at a frequency of 7.5% in the patients and heterozygotes studied.",1
11729321,"T cell responses modulated through interaction between CD8alphaalpha and the nonclassical MHC class I molecule, TL","The thymus leukemia antigen (TL) is a nonclassical class I molecule, expressed abundantly on intestinal epithelial cells. We show that, in contrast to other major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules that bind CD8alphabeta, TL preferentially binds the homotypic form of CD8alpha (CD8alphaalpha). Thus, TL tetramers react specifically to CD8alphaalpha-expressing cells, including most intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes. Compared with CD8alphabeta, which recognizes the same MHC as the T cell receptor (TCR) and thus acts as a TCR coreceptor, high-affinity binding of CD8alphaalpha to TL modifies responses mediated by TCR recognition of antigen presented by distinct MHC molecules. These findings define a novel mechanism of lymphocyte regulation through CD8alphaalpha and MHC class I.",1
